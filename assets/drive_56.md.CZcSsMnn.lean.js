Complement activation has been associated with COVID-19 severity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether chromosome 3p21.31 and the ABO variants are linked to the activation of the complement cascade in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We considered 72 unrelated European hospitalized patients with genetic data and evaluation of circulating C5a and soluble terminal complement complex C5b-9 (SC5b-9). Twenty-six (36.1%) patients carried the rs11385942 G>GA variant and 44 (66.1%) non-O blood group associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: C5a and SC5-b9 plasma levels were higher in rs11385949 GA carriers than in non-carriers (P = 0.041 and P = 0.012, respectively), while C5a levels were higher in non-O group than in O group patients (P = 0.019). The association between rs11385949 and SC5b-9 remained significant after adjustment for ABO and disease severity (P = 0.004) and further correction for C5a (P = 0.018). There was a direct relationship between upper airways viral load and SC5b-9 in carriers of the rs11385949 risk allele (P = 0.032), which was not observed in non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The rs11385949 G>GA variant, tagging the chromosome 3 gene cluster variation and predisposing to severe COVID-19, is associated with enhanced complement activation, both with C5a and terminal complement complex, while non-O blood group with C5a levels.

PrEP is safe and effective but requires adherence during potential HIV exposure, yet the facilitators of high maternal adherence are not well understood in high HIV burden settings. Methods We conducted semi structured interviews with women who reported high adherence (PrEP use >25 days in last 30-days) within a PrEP service for pregnant and postpartum women located in a large primary care facility in a high HIV burden township. Topics for interviews included: individual/interpersonal risk, disclosure, anticipated PrEP stigma, safety, side effects, and facility level factors effecting adherence. A thematic approach guided an iterative process of coding (reviewed to ensure intercoder reliability) and analysis using NVivo 12. Results We interviewed 25 postpartum women with high PrEP adherence who were on PrEP for a median of 9-months, median age 26-years, and median baseline gestational age 24-weeks. Themes identified as key drivers of optimal PrEP use were HIV risk perception, primarily due to partners perceived risky sexual behaviors and unknown serosatus, and a strong desire to have a baby free of HIV. Reported disclosure of PrEP use to family, partners and friends facilitated PrEP adherence. Women continued PrEP postpartum because they felt empowered by PrEP and did not want to go backwards and increase their HIV risk as before PrEP. Women who reported high adherence all discussed having community support and reminders to take PrEP on time. The primary barriers were anticipated or experienced stigma, which most overcame through education of partners/family about PrEP. Pregnant women experienced transient side effects, but found ways to continue, including taking PrEP at night. Women believed PrEP education and counselling were accessible when integrated into antenatal care which contributed to continued PrEP use. Conclusions Facilitators of optimal PrEP use through pregnancy and postpartum included fear of HIV acquisition for self and infant, mostly due to partner sexual behaviors and unknown serostatus, along with PrEP disclosure, and encouragement from partners and family. PrEP programs for pregnant and postpartum women should integrate strategies to assist women with realistic appraisals of risk and teach skills for securing support for significant others.","output":"'I had made the decision, and no one was going to stop me': Facilitators of PrEP adherence during pregnancy and postpartum in Cape Town, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": Since the beginning of 2020, the world has been confronted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Students' responses were analyzed according to the type of obtained data (ratio, ordinal, and categorical). RESULTS: The response rate was 95.58%. Approximately 90% of students found anatomical dissection and practical work in general to be the most important aspect of teaching, which could not be replaced by online learning. During online classes, students missed the most the interaction with other students, followed by the interaction with student teaching assistants and teaching staff. Very few students found contact lectures useful, with most students reporting that they could be replaced with recorded video lectures. In contrast, recorded video lectures were perceived as extremely helpful for studying. Regular weekly quizzes were essential during online classes as they gave students adequate feedback and guided their learning process. Students greatly benefitted from additional course materials and interactive lessons, which were made easily available via e-learning platform.

Twenty-two recreationally active men (age: 25  3 years) ran on a treadmill at four different speeds (ordered sequence of 2.8, 3.3, 2.2, and 3.9 m/s). The tests were performed without (control situation, CON) and while wearing specially designed lower leg compression sleeves (SL). Myoelectric activity of five lower leg muscles (tibialis anterior, fibularis longus, lateral and medial head of gastrocnemius, and soleus) was captured using Surface EMG. To assess muscle activation cost, the cumulative muscle activity per distance travelled (CMAPD) of the CON and SL situations was determined. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed separately for each muscle. The analyses revealed a reduced lower leg muscle activation cost with respect to test situation for SL for all muscles (p < 0.05, p2 > 0.18). The respective significant reductions of CMAPD values during SL ranged between 4% and 16% and were largest at 2.8 m/s.

In fact, while surgical and oncologic outcomes are not inferior to those achieved through a traditional open approach, patients undergoing MIE benefit from shorter length of stay, lesser pain and prompter recovery. This technique is, however, highly challenging, and the development of a MIE program, even in the setting of a tertiary center, requires time and progressive honing of surgical skills. METHODS We use a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis approach. The abdominal phase of the procedure includes complete celiac lymphadenectomy and tubularization of the stomach, which will constitute the neo-esophagus. The video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery portion of the operation takes place in left lateral decubitus and allows for optimal thoracic lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. RESULTS From October 2011 to January 2015, we treated 52 patients with the above-described procedure. The evolution of our anastomotic technique included a first group of circular stapled anastomosis with Orvil? and 3.5-mm EEA? (n = 16 patients), subsequently abandoned in favor of a linear anastomosis (n = 12), before going back to the Orvil? coupled with 4.8-mm EEA? (n = 22) in more recent times. There were also an additional two anastomoses that did not fall under any of these categories. We experienced two postoperative deaths. The overall leak rate was 14%, but fell down to 4% in the last group. Median LOS was 9 days. Lymph node retrieval was adequate throughout the whole series. CONCLUSIONS Developing a MIE program requires a significant learning curve before the results plateau. Only once a technique of choice is refined and mastered, the advantages granted by MIE become apparent.","output":"Early experience and lessons learned in a new minimally invasive esophagectomy program."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differential activation of CD4+ T cell subsets in vivo leads to the development of qualitatively different effector responses.

Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides capable of folding into complex 3D structures, enabling them to bind to a large variety of targets ranging from small ions to an entire organism. Their high binding specificity and affinity make them comparable to antibodies, but they are superior regarding a longer shelf life, simple production and chemical modification, in addition to low toxicity and immunogenicity. In the past three decades, aptamers have been used in a plethora of therapeutics and drug delivery systems that involve innovative delivery mechanisms and carrying various types of drug cargos. However, the successful translation of aptamer research from bench to bedside has been challenged by several limitations that slow down the realization of promising aptamer applications as therapeutics at the clinical level. The main limitations include the susceptibility to degradation by nucleases, fast renal clearance, low thermal stability, and the limited functional group diversity. The solution to overcome such limitations lies in the chemistry of aptamers. The current review will focus on the recent arts of aptamer chemistry that have been evolved to refine the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Moreover, this review will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such chemical modifications and how they impact the pharmacological properties of aptamers.

Although sepsis is a medical emergency that requires immediate management, screening for the occurrence of sepsis is difficult. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based model (DLM) for screening sepsis using electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 46,017 patients who were admitted to two hospitals. A total of 1,548 and 639 patients had sepsis and septic shock, respectively. The DLM was developed using 73,727 ECGs from 18,142 patients, and internal validation was conducted using 7774 ECGs from 7,774 patients. Furthermore, we conducted an external validation with 20,101 ECGs from 20,101 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the DLM across centers. RESULTS: During the internal and external validations, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DLM using 12-lead ECG was 0.901 (95% confidence interval, 0.882C0.920) and 0.863 (0.846C0.879), respectively, for screening sepsis and 0.906 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.877C0.936) and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.872C0.925), respectively, for detecting septic shock. The AUC of the DLM for detecting sepsis using 6-lead and single-lead ECGs was 0.845C0.882. A sensitivity map revealed that the QRS complex and T waves were associated with sepsis. Subgroup analysis was conducted using ECGs from 4,609 patients who were admitted with an infectious disease, and the AUC of the DLM for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.817 (0.793C0.840). There was a significant difference in the prediction score of DLM using ECG according to the presence of infection in the validation dataset (0.277 vs. 0.574, p < 0.001), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (0.260 vs. 0.725, p = 0.018).

OBJECTIVE: To explore the epidemiology of older patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A population-based study. SUBJECTS: The resident older patients (older than 65 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: Citywide case series reported to Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 12 December 2019 to 17 March 2020 were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by dates of disease onset. RESULTS: 14238 confirmed COVID-19 cases were older persons. The number of male cases were slightly less than female cases (1:1.01). The attack rate of COVID-19 in the older persons was 11.49 in Wuhan. There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic and then a gradual and steady decrease was performed. 3,723 (26.15%) and 734 (5.16%) patients were diagnosed as severe and critical cases, respectively. The attributable crude fatality ratio of COVID-19 in the older population was 222.57/100,000, and the crude fatality ratio of COVID was 19.37%. The proportion of severe and critical cases, and fatality ratio were both higher in downtown area and increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The older persons are sensitive to COVID-19. The proportion of severe and critical cases and fatality ratio are higher than that in children and younger adults. Strengthen the protection and control strategies for the older adults is of priorities. More detailed epidemiological and clinical information should be measured in further studies.","output":"Epidemiology of COVID-19 in older persons, Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has directly impacted the psychological and physical health of individuals worldwide, as well as the global economy. Food insecurity rates have risen especially in vulnerable countries like Mexico. Furthermore, social isolation and economic uncertainty have multiplied depression and anxiety disorders. Pregnant and postpartum women are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, increased stress, depression, and anxiety. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the perception of food insecurity (FI) and perceived stress in pregnant and postpartum women with rheumatic disease during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted. Patients from to the pregnancy and rheumatic diseases clinic of the University Hospital Dr. Jos E. Gonzlez in Northeast Mexico evaluated between August to October 2020 were included. The Spanish validated versions of the Household Food Security Access Scale (HFIAS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were applied by telephonic interview. The WHO recommendations were employed to determine the appropriate intake for each food group in a week. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine normality of the data. The Spearman correlation coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 29 women were included. Six (20.6%) women were found to have moderate or severe degrees of food insecurity. In addition, 12 (40.30%) perceived moderate and severe levels of stress in the PSS-10. No relationship was found between food insecurity and perceived stress (p= 0.059). The food groups that exceeded the recommended weekly frequency were oils and sugars exceeded 3.9 and 2.9 frequencies, respectively. Conclusion: We found that 20.6% women suffered household food insecurity and 40.3% suffered moderate and severe levels of stress. No relationship was found between food insecurity with the HIFAS scale and perceived stress measures with the PSS-10. We found that oils and sugars exceeded more by the double of the recommended frequency per week.","output":"Perceived stress and food insecurity in pregnant and postpartum women with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of a multi-functional, non-structural protein 3 of coronaviruses.

Across coronaviruses, PLpro showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of posttranslational conjugates despite sequence conservation. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro binds human ISG15 and K48-linked di-ubiquitin (K48-Ub2) with nanomolar affinity and detect alternate weaker-binding modes. Crystal structures of untethered PLpro complexes with ISG15 and K48-Ub2 combined with solution NMR and cross-linking mass spectrometry revealed how the two domains of ISG15 or K48-Ub2 are differently utilized in interactions with PLpro. Analysis of protein interface energetics uncovered differential binding stabilities of the two UBL/Ub domains. We emphasize how substrate recognition can be tuned to cleave specifically ISG15 or K48-Ub2 modifications while retaining capacity to cleave mono-Ub conjugates.

We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020. All patients were either discharged from hospitals or had died by April 20, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of (2) test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56C70; range 14C96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 68 days (IQR 59C78). The most common solid tumour types were breast (40 [20%] patients), colorectal (28 [14%]), and lung cancer (24 [12%]). 54 (30%) of 182 patients received antitumour therapies within 4 weeks before symptom onset. 30 (15%) of 205 patients were transferred to an intensive care unit and 40 (20%) died during hospital admission. Patients with haematological malignancies had poorer prognoses than did those with solid tumours: nine (41%) of 22 patients with haematological malignancies died versus 31 (17%) of 183 patients with solid tumours (hazard ratio for death 328 [95% CI 156C691]; log rank p=00009). Multivariable regression analysis showed that receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] 351 [95% CI 116C1059]; p=0026) and male sex (OR 386 [95% CI 157C950]; p=00033) were risk factors for death during admission to hospital. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had a high case-fatality rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors, including receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset and male sex, might help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of fatal outcomes.

METHODS: Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed using data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board (KPRB) and the UK Biobank. ACL and PCL injury cases were identified based on electronic health records from KPRB and the UK Biobank. GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for ACL and PCL injury using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, age at enrolment, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The data from the two GWA studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Candidate genes previously reported to show an association with ACL injury in athletes were also tested for association from the meta-analysis data from the KPRB and the UK Biobank GWA studies. RESULTS: There was a total of 2,214 cases of ACL and PCL injury and 519,869 controls within the two cohorts, with three loci demonstrating a genome-wide significant association in the meta-analysis: INHBA, AEBP2, and LOC101927869. Of the eight candidate genes previously studied in the literature, six were present in the current dataset, and only COL3A1 (rs1800255) showed a significant association (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Genetic markers in three novel loci in this study and one previously-studied candidate gene were identified as potential risk factors for ACL and PCL injury and deserve further validation and investigation of molecular mechanisms.

However, results on long-term clinical outcomes are lacking. METHODS We assessed clinical outcomes 2 years after patients were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular treatment (intervention group) or conventional treatment (control group) for acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 2 years; this scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and the quality of life at 2 years, as measured by means of a health utility index that is based on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (scores range from -0.329 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health). RESULTS Of the 500 patients who underwent randomization in the original trial, 2-year data for this extended follow-up trial were available for 391 patients (78.2%) and information on death was available for 459 patients (91.8%). The distribution of outcomes on the modified Rankin scale favored endovascular treatment over conventional treatment (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 2.45; P=0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients who had an excellent outcome (i.e., a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1). The mean quality-of-life score was 0.48 among patients randomly assigned to endovascular treatment as compared with 0.38 among patients randomly assigned to conventional treatment (mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.16; P=0.006). The cumulative 2-year mortality rate was 26.0% in the intervention group and 31.0% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2; P=0.46). CONCLUSIONS In this extended follow-up trial, the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome at 2 years in patients with acute ischemic stroke was similar to that reported at 90 days in the original trial.

Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders in the world. Evidence-based treatment of TUD is effective, but treatment accessibility remains very low. A dearth of specially trained clinicians is a significant barrier to treatment accessibility, even within systems of care that implement brief intervention models. The treatment of TUD is becoming more complex and tailoring treatment to address new and traditional tobacco products is needed. The Council for Tobacco Treatment Training Programs (Council) is the accrediting body for Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) training programs. Between 2016 and 2019, n = 7761 trainees completed Council-accredited TTS training programs. Trainees were primarily from North America (92.6%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (6.1%) and were trained via in-person group workshops in medical and academic settings. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Council-accredited training programs increased from 14 to 22 and annual number of trainees increased by 28.5%. Trainees have diverse professional backgrounds and work in diverse settings but were primarily White (69.1%) and female (78.7%) located in North America. Nearly two-thirds intended to implement tobacco treatment services in their setting; two-thirds had been providing tobacco treatment for 1 year or less; and 20% were sent to training by their employers. These findings suggest that the training programs are contributing to the development of a new workforce of TTSs as well as the development of new programmatic tobacco treatment services in diverse settings.

Several studies have demonstrated its high success rate and low morbidity. This study aimed to identify the predictors of adverse outcomes associated with UU. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients with UD treated with UU at the study institution. Patients with less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Charts were reviewed for demographics, pre-operative imaging, surgical indications, operative notes, and follow-up data. Pre-operative and intra-operative variables were tested for association with adverse outcomes including unplanned surgery, worsening hydronephrosis, and febrile UTI recurrence. RESULTS A total of 35 patients underwent UU for UD between 2009 and 2017 at the study institution. The majority (33/35) had a distal anastomosis. A concomitant re-implantation of the recipient ureter was performed in 9 (25.7%) patients. After a median follow-up of 36.7 months, adverse outcomes developed in 9 patients (25.7%). No further surgery was required in 88.6% of the subjects. Adverse outcomes were associated with female gender (p = 0.048) and hydronephrosis of both upper and lower moieties (p = 0.015) and were more likely associated with ectopic ureteroceles (50%, p = 0.074) and having a concomitant re-implant performed (44.4%, p = 0.19) (table). DISCUSSION In this study, the low re-operation rates of UU for treating UD in patients with ectopic ureters or intravesical ureteroceles was demonstrated. The majority of patients with ectopic ureteroceles treated with UU and concomitant ureteral re-implantation had worsening hydronephrosis of both moieties and recurrent febrile UTI in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Interestingly, some of them had progression of hydronephrosis after excision of the upper pole. While worsening of hydronephrosis of the recipient moiety after UU was historically attributed to yo-yo reflux, most of the study patients did not have worsening hydronephrosis despite having distal anastomosis. Therefore, mechanical obstruction should be ruled out, and any underlying bladder dysfunction should be aggressively managed in patients with worsening hydronephrosis or recurrent UTI after UU before considering additional surgery. CONCLUSION Ureteroureterostomy is a successful option for UD with a low risk of adverse events in patients with ectopic ureters or intravesical ureteroceles. However, it should be cautiously considered in patients with hydronephrosis of both moieties, with ectopic ureteroceles, or if a concomitant re-implant is needed.","output":"Ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy for ureteral duplication anomalies: predictors of adverse outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns regarding the effect of social disruptions on parental mental health, family well-being, and children's adjustment. Due to the pace of the pandemic, measures of pandemic-related disruption have not been subject to rigorous empirical validation. To address this gap, a multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%;United States, 19%;Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) of 372 female caregivers and 158 male caregivers of 5-18-year-old children was recruited online. Participants completed a survey including a 25-item scale indexing disruption in finances, basic needs, personal and family welfare, career/education, household responsibilities, and family relationships related to the pandemic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded an optimal three-factor solution: factors included Income Stress (five items related to income, debt, and job loss;loadings ranged from 0.57 to 0.91), Family Stress (seven items related to family altercations and child management;loadings from 0.57 to 0.87), and Chaos Stress (four items related to access to supplies, crowded shopping areas, news coverage;loadings from 0.53 to 0.70). Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated measurement invariance of each factor across female and male caregivers, indicating that factor structure, loadings, and thresholds were equivalent across groups. Composites reflective of each factor were computed, and Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that female caregivers consistently scored higher than male caregivers on COVID-19 stressors related to income, family, and chaos. Finally, concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant bivariate correlations between each scale and caregiver, family, and child outcomes, respectively. This demonstrates the validity of the COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale for use with female and male caregivers in family-based research. The current sample was predominantly White-European, married/common-law, and had at least some post-secondary education.

According to short-term clinical trials, protection against infection is estimated to reach up to 95% after complete vaccination (14 days after receipt of all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses). Nevertheless, infections despite vaccination, so-called breakthrough infections, are documented. Even though they are more likely to have a milder or even asymptomatic course, the assessment of further transmission is highly relevant for successful containment. Therefore, we calculated the real-world transmission risk from fully vaccinated patients (vaccination group, VG) to their close contacts (CP) compared with the risk from unvaccinated reference persons matched according to age, sex, and virus type (control group = CG) utilizing data from Colognes health department. Results: A total of 357 breakthrough infections occurred among Cologne residents between 27 December 2020 (the date of the first vaccination in Cologne) and 6 August 2021. Of the 979 CPs in VG, 99 (10.1%) became infected. In CG, 303 of 802 CPs (37.8%) became infected. Factors promoting transmission included non-vaccinated status ( = 0.237; p < 0.001), male sex ( = 0.079; p = 0.049), the presence of symptoms ( = ?0.125; p = 0.005), and lower cycle threshold value ( = ?0.125; p = 0.032). This model explained 14.0% of the variance (corr. R(2)). Conclusion: The number of transmissions from unvaccinated controls was three times higher than from fully vaccinated patients.

Both cash transfers and food security may have important contributions to child cognitive development. This study examines the potential impact of combinations of cash transfers and food security status on child cognitive development and educational outcomes. Cross-sectional data for 796 HIV-affected children in the Child Community Care study were utilised for this analysis. Children and caregivers completed interview schedules comprised of standardised items on socio-demographics, household data, cash grant receipt and food security status, school achievement, and cognition. A series of logistic and linear regression models and marginal effects analyses were undertaken to explore the impacts of differing levels of social protection (none; either cash grant receipt or food secure status or, both in combination) on child educational and cognitive outcomes. Although all children lived in poverty-stricken households, 20% (157/796) of children did not live in a household in receipt of a cash grant and did not report food security; 32.4% (258/796) reported either component of social protection and, 47.9% (381/796) received both measures of social protection in combination. Compared to no social protection, being in receipt of either component of social protection was found to be significantly associated with being in the correct class for age, higher scores of non-verbal cognition, and higher working memory scores. Receiving both social protection measures in combination was found to be significantly associated with reduced educational risk scores, improved odds of being in the correct class for age, regular school attendance, missing less than a week of school in the previous two weeks, higher scores on measures of nonverbal cognition, higher working memory scores, and learning new things more easily. Educational and cognitive outcomes for children can be bolstered by social protection measures (cash grant receipt or food security). Benefits are enhanced when social protection is received in combination. Such findings support the notion of synergistic social protection responses for children living in environments impacted by high levels of HIV burden and deprivation.","output":"Food Should not be Forgotten: Impacts of Combined Cash Transfer Receipt and Food Security on Child Education and Cognition in South Africa and Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with West Nile virus and dengue virus, two mosquito-borne flaviviruses, is enhanced by two calcium-dependent lectins: dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), and its related molecule (DC-SIGNR).

Thus, the objective of this research was to analyze whether different types of emotion regulation strategies, both adaptive and maladaptive, mediate the relationship between family of origin violence and intimate partner violence in the Mexican population. A total of 838 participants (45.9% men and 54.1% women) responded to instruments addressing family of origin violence, emotion regulation strategies, and intimate partner violence. The results revealed that both structural models were significant. For women, the model showed an adequate fit X(2) (11, N = 838) = 22.75, p = .288, GFI = .95, AGFI = .91, NFI = .98, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05.

Specifically, the direct effects of adaptive strategies on intimate partner violence were statistically significant. Meanwhile, the direct effects of family of origin violence on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were significant, as were the direct effects of maladaptive strategies on intimate partner violence. In turn, the indirect effects of family of-origin violence were significantly related to intimate partner violence via maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.

To clarify the hypothesis that CRF attenuates the incident risk of pneumonia due to inflammation, we conducted a prospective study examining the independent and joint associations of inflammation and CRF on the risk of pneumonia in a population sample of 2041 middle-aged men. METHODS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly measured as peak oxygen uptake (V??O2peak) during progressive exercise testing to volitional fatigue, and categorized into tertiles. Inflammation was defined by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Pneumonia cases were identified by internal medicine physicians using the International Classification of Diseases codes in clinical practice. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 27 yr, 432 pneumonia cases were recorded. High hsCRP and CRF were associated with a higher risk (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88) and a lower risk of pneumonia (HR = 0.55; CI, 0.39-0.76) after adjusting for potential confounders, respectively. Compared with normal hsCRP-Fit, moderate to high hsCRP-Unfit had an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.63; CI, 1.21-2.20), but moderate to high hsCRP-Fit was not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.25; CI, 0.93-1.68).

The present study was undertaken to get better insights into the extent of secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Indian hospitalized patients and to assess how these alter the course of COVID19 so that the control measures can be suggested. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentre study where data of all RTPCR positive COVID19 patients was accessed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a network of 10 hospitals across 5 North Indian states admitted during the period from March 2020 to July 2021.The data included demographic profile of patients, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters treatment modalities and outcome in those with secondary infections (SIs) and those without SIs. Spectrum of SIS was also studied in detail. Results: Of 19852 RTPCR positive SARSCO2 patients admitted during the study period, 1940 (9.8%) patients developed SIs. Patients with SIs were 8 years older on average (median age 62.6 years versus 54.3 years P<0.001) than those without SIs. The risk of SIs was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with age, severity of disease at admission, diabetes, ICU admission, and ventilator use. The most common site of infection was urinary tract infection (UTI) (41.7%), followed by blood stream infection (BSI) (30.8%), sputum/BAL/ET fluid (24.8%), and the least was pus/wound discharge (2.6%). As many as 13.4% had infections with more than organism and 34.1% patients had positive cultures from more than one site. Gram negative bacilli (GNB) were the commonest organisms (63.2%), followed by Gram positive cocci (GPC) (19.6%) and fungus (17.3%). Most of the patients with SIs were on multiple antimicrobials the most commonly used were the BL BLI for GNBs (76.9%) followed by carbapenems (57.7%), cephalosporins (53.9%) and antibiotics carbapenem resistant entreobacteriace (47.1%). The usage of emperical antibiotics for GPCs was in 58.9% and of antifungals in 56.9% of cases, and substantially more than the results obtained by culture. The average stay in hospital for patients with SIs was twice than those without SIs (median 13 days versus 7 days). The overall mortality in the group with SIs (40.3%) was more than 8 times of that in those without SIs (4.6%). Only 1.2% of SI patients with mild COVID 19 at presentation died, while 17.5% of those with moderate disease and 58.5% of those with severe COVID 19 died (P< 0.001). The mortality was highest in those with BSI (49.8%), closely followed by those with HAP (47.9%), and then UTI and SSTI (29.4% each). The mortality rate where only one microorganism was identified was 37.8% and rose to 56.3% in those with more than one microorganism. The mortality in cases with only one site of infection was 28.8%, which steeply rose to 62.5% in cases with multiple sites of infection. The mortality in diabetic patients with SIs was 45.2% while in non-diabetics it was 34.3% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Secondary bacterial and fungal infections can complicate the course of almost 10% of COVID19 hospitalised patients. These patients tend to not only have a much longer stay in hospital, but also a higher requirement for oxygen and ICU care. The mortality in this group rises steeply by as much as 8 times. The group most vulnerable to this complication are those with more severe COVID19 illness, elderly, and diabetic patients. Varying results in different studies suggest that a region or country specific guideline be developed for appropriate use of antibiotics and antifungals to prevent their overuse in such cases.

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","output":"Multi-Center Study of Temporal Changes and Prognostic Value of a CT Visual Severity Score in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of vancomycin has continued to expand because of the increasing number of patients infected or colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, causing an increase in the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

The optimal anticoagulation strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is unknown, and therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of argatroban with or without aspirin as an alternative anticoagulation strategy in this patient population. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Single-center tertiary-care facility in Fort Sam Houston, TX, from 2020 to 2021. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients who were cannulated for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Argatroban, with or without aspirin, was substituted for heparin in coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty percent of our coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation demonstrated heparin resistance, and patients who were initially started on heparin were significantly more likely to require a change to argatroban than vice versa due to difficulty achieving or maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation goals (93.4% vs 11.1%; p < 0.0001). The time to reach the therapeutic anticoagulation goal was significantly longer for patients who were initially started on heparin in comparison with argatroban (24 vs 6 hr; p = 0.0173).

CONCLUSIONS: Argatroban, with or without aspirin, is an effective anticoagulation strategy for patients who require venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support secondary to coronavirus disease 2019. In comparison with heparin, this anticoagulation strategy was not associated with a significant difference in bleeding or thrombotic complications, and was associated with a significantly decreased time to therapeutic anticoagulation goal, likely as a result of high rates of heparin resistance observed in this patient population.","output":"Argatroban for Anticoagulation in Patients Requiring Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"7 Figure 1Abstract 7 Figure 2Abstract 7 Figure 3Abstract 7 Figure 4Abstract 7 Figure 5ConclusionsUsing Quality improvement methodology in our collaborative film making enabled us to continually improve the experience and inclusion of patients in a creative project.

This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle. METHODS: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced. RESULTS: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air.

SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 enters cells by surface spike protein binding to host cell receptor angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Isolated S protein of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\1 has been shown to induce an innate immune response. Here we investigate the cytokine response of monocytes with and without comorbidities (obesity and hypertension) exposed to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein, and the effects of this response on endothelial barrier function. METHODS: Human CD14+ monocytes (Lonza, Precision for Medicine) from two Caucasian males in their 50s, one with obesity and hypertension (HTN) and one without, were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL [positive control]), recombinant spike receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD, 10 ug/mL) or serum\\\\free media (negative control) for 48 hours. Monocyte conditioned media (MCM) was collected and cytokines (IL\\\\6, IL\\\\8, IL\\\\10, IL\\\\12p70, IL\\\\1beta, IFN\\\\gamma, TNF\\\\alpha, IL\\\\4) were analyzed by multiplex ELISA. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) from a healthy donor were exposed to MCM from healthy or HTN subjects. Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell\\\\substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Briefly, HLMVECs were seeded on ECIS chambers to proliferate until impedance plateaued. Half of the media was then replaced with MCM. Differences in impedance drops were compared among various conditions. Western blotting was used to investigate Spike RBD internalization. RESULTS: Spike RBD and resulted in increased IL\\\\6, IL\\\\8, IL\\\\12p70, and TNF\\\\alpha compared to negative control (Fig1A). Monocytes from HTN subject showed increased secretion of IL\\\\6, IL\\\\8 and IL\\\\12p70 compared to those from the healthy subject (Fig 1B). HLMVECs showed moderate long\\\\term barrier disruption, when treated with Spike RBD alone and Spike RBD with MCM from healthy subjects and no difference in transient barrier disruption or recovery. HLMVECs exposed to MCM from HTN subjects showed increased long\\\\term barrier dysfunction, especially with Spike RBD present, and recovery of barrier function was also hampered (Fig 2). Spike RBD was observed to be internalized by both monocytes and HLMVECs. DISCUSSION: Spike RBD alone induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by CD14+ monocytes and is further increased in monocytes from the obese/HTN subject. Exposure to Spike RBD and MCM from both healthy and HTN subjects caused significant long\\\\term endothelial barrier dysfunction in HLMVECs with increased dysfunction seen for the obese/HTN MCM. These results are consistent with clinical experience with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased disease severity, and worse outcome in COVID\\\\19 patients with comorbidities.

Viral epidemiology is the study of the factors that determine the frequency and distribution of viral diseases in an animal population. In the broadest sense, epidemiology may be viewed as a part of population biology, involving not only environmental factors but also genetic factors in both the virus and the host. The terms incidence and prevalence are used to describe quantitative aspects of the occurrence of infections in populations. The incidence of infection is defined as the proportion of a population contracting that infection during a specified period, whereas prevalence refers to the proportion infected at a particular point in time. The comparisons of incidence and prevalence at different times and places are made by relating the appropriate numerator to a denominator that may be as general as the total population of the animal species concerned or may be specified as the susceptible population at risk. A disease is said to be enzootic when there are continuous chains of transmission in the region involved; epizootics are peaks in disease incidence. The size of the peak required to constitute an epizootic is arbitrary and is related to the background enzootic rate, the morbidity, and the anxiety that the disease arouses.","output":"Epidemiology of Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects the whole world and restricts the social life globally.

METHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Annunziata Hospital in Cosenza, Italy, through March 7, 2020, who received at least one dose of tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously for the treatment of COVID-19Crelated CRS in addition to standard care were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary observation was the incidence of grade 4 CRS after tocilizumab treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations. FINDINGS: Twelve patients were included; all had fever, cough, and fatigue at presentation, and all had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, six patients; diabetes, five patients; chronic obstructive lung disease, four patients). Seven patients received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and five received non-invasive mechanical ventilation for lung complications of COVID-19. No incidence of grade 4 CRS was observed within 1 week of tocilizumab administration in all 12 patients (100%) and within 2 days of tocilizumab administration in 5 patients (42%). The predominant pattern on chest CT scans at presentation was ground-glass opacity, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. Follow-up CT scans 7 to 10 days after tocilizumab treatment showed improvement of lung manifestations in all patients. No adverse events or new safety concerns attributable to tocilizumab were reported. INTERPRETATION: Tocilizumab administered subcutaneously to patients with COVID-19 and CRS is a promising treatment for reduction in disease activity and improvement in lung function. The effect of tocilizumab should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial.","output":"Subcutaneous tocilizumab treatment in patients with severe COVID-19Crelated cytokine release syndrome: An observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, important elective procedures, such as screening colonoscopy, have been delayed or cancelled, and there may be a very long waitlist for rescheduling once the moratorium is lifted.

The findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, BAL from COVID-19 patients was characterized by significant lymphocytosis (p < 0.001), in contrast to peripheral blood lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients and the presence of atypical lymphocytes with plasmacytoid/plasmablastic features (p < 0.001). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that BAL lymphocytes, including plasmacytoid and plasmablastic cells, were composed predominantly of T cells with a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Both populations had increased expression of T-cell activation markers, suggesting important roles of helper and cytotoxic T-cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. More importantly, BAL lymphocytosis was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.05) and longer requirement for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), whereas the median atypical (activated) lymphocyte count was associated with shorter hospital stay (p < 0.05), shorter time on mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05) and improved survival.

This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression.

METHOD: This was a single-center open-label randomized controlled study. Consecutive patients followed at the LN clinic were randomized to either TM or standard FU (SF) group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TM group received FU via videoconferencing. SF group patients continued conventional in-person outpatient care. The 6-month data were compared and presented. RESULTS: From June to December 2020, 122 patients were randomized (TM: 60, SF: 62) and had at least 2 FUs. There were no baseline differences, including SLEDAI-2k and proportion of patients in lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS), between the two groups except a higher physician global assessment score (PGA) in the TM group. After a mean FU of 19.8  4.5 weeks, the overall patient satisfaction score was higher in the TM group.

Delaying resection can allow for interim disease progression, but the impact of this delay on mortality is unknown. The COVID-19 infection rate at which immediate operative risk exceeds benefit is unknown. We sought to model immediate versus delayed surgical resection in a T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed, and sensitivity analyses performed. The base case was a 65-year-old male smoker presenting with cT1b esophageal adenocarcinoma scheduled for esophagectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared immediate surgical resection to delayed resection after 3 months. The likelihood of key outcomes was derived from the literature where available. The outcome was 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: Proceeding with immediate esophagectomy for the base case scenario resulted in slightly improved 5-year overall survival when compared to delaying surgery by 3 months (5-year overall survival 0.74 for immediate and 0.73 for delayed resection). In sensitivity analyses, a delayed approach became preferred when the probability of perioperative COVID-19 infection increased above 7%. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate resection of early esophageal cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic did not decrease 5-year survival when compared to resection after 3 months for the base case scenario. However, as the risk of perioperative COVID-19 infection increases above 7%, a delayed approach has improved 5-year survival.

The study used the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI), a parent-report measure designed for youth with ASD. The EDI asks parents about current severity and perceived change (i.e. how current severity compares to lifetime severity) in emotion dysregulation, and includes two factors: Reactivity (rapidly escalating, intense negative affect) and Dysphoria (poorly upregulated positive affect, general unease). RESULTS: Results indicated that youth with ASD had greater Reactivity severity and also greater positive change in Reactivity than non-ASD peers. Furthermore, differences between youth with and without ASD in the relationship between Reactivity and Dysphoria suggest a distinct profile of emotion dysregulation in ASD. Within the ASD sample, age and severity of stereotyped behavior predicted Reactivity and Dysphoria severity and Reactivity change. Female gender, lower parent education, and fluent verbal ability were additional predictors of increased Reactivity severity, while intellectual disability predicted lower Dysphoria severity.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACEa??Angiotensin IIa??AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse' ACEa??Angiotensin IIa??AT1 receptor axis and the 'protective' ACE2a??Angiotensin1-7a??Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerando a possibilidade de erros na identifica??o das les?es e a necessidade de melhorar o diagnstico, o objetivo desse trabalho foi caracterizar macroscopicamente e microscopicamente as principais les?es parasitrias observadas em ovinos na linha de abate.

RESULTS: Side effects were observed in 37 (10.36%) out of 357 patients using favipiravir. The most common side effect was liver dysfunction, in 26 (7.28%) of the patients. The following other side effects were also observed: diarrhea (1.4%), nausea (0.84%), abdominal pain (0.28%) and thrombocytopenia (0.28%). One patient (0.28%) presented both increased transaminases and nausea. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was determined that favipiravir may constitute an alternative for treating COVID-19 pneumonia given that its side effects are generally well tolerated and not serious.","output":"Adverse effects associated with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In May 2019, the Government of British Columbia (BC) announced the implementation of the Biosimilars Initiative, mandating the switch of biologic (originator) drugs to biosimilars for certain patient populations in the hopes of optimizing public resources. Through this qualitative study, we aimed to identify patients' perspectives as they undergo this change. From October 2019 to July 2020, we conducted nine pre- and six post-switch to biosimilar interviews with BC, English speaking participants, who were 18 years or older, and were currently taking a biologic medication. Participants were interviewed pre- and post-switch to a biosimilar medication and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis. Interviews were thematically analysed and major themes and sub-categories were elucidated. The themes derived from pre and post-switch interviews captured participants' anticipated or experienced barriers and enablers to the policy change. In general, the fears and apprehension of participants approaching the switch, including concerns surrounding the efficacy and safety of biosimilars, were addressed by their rheumatologist and social support circles. For the most part, participants were able to successfully manage their disease regardless of their baseline concerns about efficacy and safety. Experiences of changes in health delivery models were also observed secondary to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic amongst participants. This study is the first of its kind to characterize the patient perspective regarding the BC Biosimilars Initiative.

Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. RESULTS: Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach.

Little is known about bat immune systems or how the immune responses of bats control infections. The recent characterization of genome and transcriptome sequences of several bat species suggests they are similar to other mammals. These data indicate that bats possess orthologous genes, antibodies, and cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses as do other mammals, but bats likely evolved unique mechanisms for controlling viruses that cause disease in other species.

A variety of methods have been tested in the attempt to prevent POPF, most of them without convincing results. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library to identify clinical studies comparing pancreatic stump closure with the addition of Tachosil(?) to conventional stump closure. The identified studies were critically appraised, and meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Dichotomous data were pooled using odds ratios, and weighted mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes, together with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS Four studies (two randomised controlled trials and two retrospective clinical studies) reporting data from 738 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall POPF, clinically-relevant POPF, mortality, reoperations, intraoperative blood loss and length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between conventional closure and additional covering of the pancreatic stump with Tachosil(?). A sensitivity analysis of only randomised controlled trials confirmed the results. CONCLUSIONS The application of Tachosil(?) to the pancreatic stump after distal pancreatectomy is a safe procedure but provides no relevant benefit in terms of POPF, mortality, reoperation rate, blood loss or length of hospital stay.

Guidelines often require 2 years or more to develop, but certain circumstances necessitate the development of rapid guidelines (RGs) in a short period of time. Upholding methodological rigor while meeting the reduced development timeframe presents a challenge for developing RGs. Our objective was to review current practices and standards for the development of RGs. This is the first of a series of three articles addressing methodological issues around RGs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic survey of methods manuals and published RGs to identify reasons for the development of RGs. Data sources included existing guideline manuals, published RGs, Trip Medical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE and communication with guideline developers until February 2018. RESULTS: We identified 46 guidelines that used a shortened timeframe for their development. Nomenclature describing RGs varied across organisations, wherein the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced Interim Guidelines, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom developed Short Clinical Guidelines, and WHO provided Rapid Advice. The rationale for RGs included response to emergencies, rapid increases in cases of a condition or disease severity, or new evidence regarding treatment. In general, the methods to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflict of interest were not always clear. While we identified another 11 RGs from other institutions, there was no reference to timeframe and reasons for conducting a RG. The three organisations mentioned above provide guidance for the development of RGs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of standardised nomenclature and definitions regarding RGs and there is inconsistency in the methods described in manuals and in RG. It is therefore important that all RGs provide a detailed and transparent description of their methods in order for readers and end-users to be able to assess their quality and validate their findings.

RECENT FINDINGS: Influenza vaccination in HCP provides benefits to both HCP and patients, including reductions in patient morbidity and mortality and decreases in HCP absenteeism. Despite these benefits, influenza vaccine coverage among HCP still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 90%. As a result, healthcare institutions have used various practices to boost vaccination, including mandatory vaccine policies and requiring non-immunized HCP to wear masks during the influenza season. All of these efforts have been successful at increasing vaccination rates, and employer vaccination requirements have led to rates that meet the Healthy People 2020 goal. Rates of mandatory vaccine policies have increased over time, and several states now have influenza vaccine requirements. However, additional study into how these policies improve patient outcomes is needed. SUMMARY: Continued effort is needed to boost influenza vaccination rates among HCP, and mandatory vaccine policies may be used if other methods have not been effective in adequately raising vaccination rates.

Due to its high infectiousness, the health care staff is even more exposed. Nevertheless, there is still very limited information about it, especially among pediatricians. OBJECTIVE To assess the seroprevalence of SARSCoV- 2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital 3 months after the first case in Argentina. To explore if certain demographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. METHODS Cross-sectional study of physicians randomly selected from the list of workers of a children's hospital. All of them were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by chemiluminescence (immunoglobulins G/M [IgG/IgM]) and their epidemiological history was collected (age, place of residence, professional category, contact with infected people) in order to explore the association between predictors and seropositivity. RESULTS A total of 116 physicians were included; their average age was 45.6  13.3 years. Of them, 62.9 % were staff physicians, and the rest, residents; 42.2 % worked in areas designated for direct care of COVID-19 patients. Four (3.5 %) referred contact with infected people without the appropriate protection, and 6 (5.2 %), having traveled to risk areas. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) were only detected in one of the professionals. Because of this, it was impossible to assess the association between potential predictors and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Our previous experiments demonstrated that ATMUV infection effectively triggered host innate immune response through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways. However, little information is available on the role of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in defending against ATMUV infection. In this study, we found that ATMUV infection induced robust expression of type I and type III interferon (IFNs) in duck tissues. Furthermore, we observed that expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was significantly upregulated in DEF and DF-1 cells after infection with ATMUV. Similar results were obtained from in vivo studies using ATMUV-infected ducklings. Importantly, we showed that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 by specific shRNA markedly enhanced ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells. However, disruption of IFITM2 expression had no obvious effect on the ATMUV replication. In addition, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 in DF-1 cells impaired the replication of ATMUV. Taken together, these results reveal that induced expression of avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 in response to ATMUV infection can effectively restrict the virus replication, and suggest that increasing IFITM proteins in host may be a useful strategy for control of ATMUV infection.","output":"Avian Interferon-Inducible Transmembrane Protein Family Effectively Restricts Avian Tembusu Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La obesidad es una enfermedad que lidera el disfuncionamiento de numerosos rganos.

Population studies, clinical studies, and in vitro animal studies underscore the critical importance of oral health to systemic health. These inextricable relationships come to the forefront as oral diseases, such as periodontal disease, take root. Special populations bring to bear the multimodal relationships between oral and systemic health. Specifically, periodontal disease has been associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, eating disorders, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and cancer. Although bidirectional relationships are recognized, the potential for multiple comorbidities, relationships, and connections (multimodal relationships) also exists. Proposed mechanisms that mediate this connection between oral and systemic health include predisposing and precipitating factors, such as genetic factors (gene polymorphisms), environmental factors (stress, habitssuch as smoking and high\\\\fat diets/consumption of highly processed foods), medications, microbial dysbiosis and bacteremias/viremias/microbemias, and an altered host immune response. Thus, in a susceptible host, these predisposing and precipitating factors trigger the onset of periodontal disease and systemic disease/conditions. Further, high\\\\throughput sequencing technologies are shedding light on the dark matter that comprises the oral microbiome. This has resulted in better characterization of the oral microbial dysbiosis, including putative bacterial periodontopathogens and shifts in oral virome composition during disease. Multiple laboratory and clinical studies have illustrated that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses within subgingival plaque and periodontal tissues affect periodontal inflammation, putative periodontopathogens, and the host immune response. Although the association between herpesviruses and periodontitis and the degree to which these viruses directly aggravate periodontal tissue damage remain unclear, the benefits to periodontal health found from prolonged administration of antivirals in immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals demonstrates that specific populations are possibly more susceptible to viral periodontopathogens. Thus, it may be important to further examine the implications of viral pathogen involvement in periodontitis and perhaps it is time to embrace the viral dark matter within the periodontal environment to fully comprehend the pathogenesis and systemic implications of periodontitis. Emerging data from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic further underscores the inextricable connection between oral and systemic health, with high levels of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 receptor noted on oral tissues (tongue) and an allostatic load or overload paradigm of chronic stress likely contributing to rapid breakdown of oral/dental, periodontal, and peri\\\\implant tissues.

In vitro RNA structural models complement such approaches and offer RNA structures based on experimental data obtained in a simplified environment, which are needed for proper optimization and analysis. Herein, we present the secondary structure of the influenza A virus segment 5 vRNA of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain, based on experimental data from DMS chemical mapping and SHAPE using NMIA, supported by base-pairing probability calculations and bioinformatic analyses. A comparison of the available vRNA5 structures among distant IAV strains revealed that a number of motifs present in the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) vRNA5 model are highly conserved despite sequence differences, located within previously identified packaging signals, and the formation of which in in virio conditions has been confirmed. These results support functional roles of the RNA secondary structure motifs, which may serve as candidates for universal RNA-targeting inhibitory methods.","output":"Conserved Structural Motifs of Two Distant IAV Subtypes in Genomic Segment 5 RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations offering work-integrated learning (WIL) opportunities were no longer able to support student placements, resulting in many institutions searching for a range of innovative solutions.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes lung tissue damage directly by targeting cells or indirectly by producing inflammatory cytokines. However, whether functional alterations are related to metabolic changes in lung cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the lung single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data of several deceased COVID-19 patients and focused on changes in transcripts associated with cellular metabolism. We observed upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in alveolar type 2 progenitor cells, which may block alveolar epithelial differentiation and surfactant secretion. Elevated inositol phosphate metabolism in airway progenitor cells may promote neutrophil infiltration and damage the lung barrier. Further, multiple metabolic alterations in the airway goblet cells are associated with impaired muco-ciliary clearance. Increased glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and inositol phosphate metabolism not only enhance macrophage activation but also contribute to SARS-CoV-2 induced lung injury. The cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and CD8(+) T cells may be enhanced by glycerolipid and inositol phosphate metabolism. Glycolytic activation in fibroblasts is related to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrogenesis. Glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutathione metabolism may also boost the aging, apoptosis and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed a possible cellular metabolic basis for the altered innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and niche cell function in the lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Medical images of coronavirus patients show that the lungs are filled with sticky mucus that prevents them from inhaling. Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithms have made a significant shift in the computer aided diagnosis due to their effective feature extraction capabilities. In this survey, a complete and systematic review of the application of Machine Learning (ML) methods for the detection of COVID-19 is presented, focused on works that used medical images.

Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS?. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82%; NAP, n = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61%; NAP, n = 5) were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived risk of potential exposure to COVID-19.

It is implemented at various levels of healthcare education and certification today. However, its use remains unevenly distributed across the globe due to misconception regarding its cost and complexity and to lack of evidence for its consistency and validity. Implementation may also be hindered by an array of factors unique to the locale and its norms. Resource-poor settings may benefit from diverting external funds for short-term simulation projects towards collaboration with local experts and local material sourcing to reduce the overall cost and achieve long-term benefits. The recent shift of focus towards patient safety and calls for reduction in training duration have burdened educators with providing adequate quantity and quality of clinical exposure to students and residents in a short time. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely hindered clinical education to curb the spread of illness. Simulation may be beneficial in these circumstances and improve learner confidence. We undertook a literature search on MEDLINE using MeSH terms to obtain relevant information on simulation-based medical education and how to best apply it. Integration of simulation into curricula is an essential step of its implementation.

Influenza A, B and C viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were simultaneously detected in clinical samples by multiple reverse transcription nested-PCR assay. The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples using two separate RT-PCR tests. RESULTS A respiratory virus was detected in 65.9% of the 749 children included in the study. hMPV, found in 69 of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (14%), was the most common virus after RSV. Peak incidence was in March and over 80% of children were <12 months of age. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (49.3%) and bronchiolitis (46.4%). Oxygen therapy was required by 58% of patients, and assisted ventilation by one. Clinical characteristics in the 18 co-infections were indistinguishable from those of single infections. Fifty one hMPV single infections were compared with 88 hRSV single infections. Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed more frequently in hMPV patients.

It is characterized by disruption of gas exchange inside the alveoli, accumulation of protein edema, and an increase in lung stiffness. One major cause of ARDS is a lung infection, such as SARS-COV-2 infection. Lungs of ARDS patients need to be mechanically ventilated for airway reopening. Consequently, ventilation might damage delicate lung tissue leading to excess edema, known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Mortality of COVID-19 patients under VILI seems to be higher than non-COVID patients, necessitating effective preventative therapies. VILI occurs when small air bubbles form in the alveoli, injuring epithelial cells (EPC) due to shear stress. Nitric oxide (NO) inhalation was suggested as a therapy for ARDS, however, it was shown that it is not effective because of the extremely short half-life of NO. In this study, NO-releasing nanoparticles were produced and tested in an in vitro model, representing airways in the deep lung. Cellular injuries were quantified via fluorescent live/dead assay. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to assess cell morphology. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the expression of inflammatory markers, specifically IL6 and CCL2. ELISA was performed to assess IL6 and confirm qRT-PCR results at the protein level. Finally, ROS levels were assessed in all groups. Here, we show that NO delivery via nanoparticles enhanced EPC survival and recovery, AFM measurements revealed that NO exposure affect cell morphology, while qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant downregulation in IL6 and CCL2 expression when treating the cells to NO both before and after shear exposure. ELISA results for IL6 confirmed qRT-PCR data. ROS experiment results support our findings from previous experiments. These findings demonstrate that NO-releasing nanoparticles can be used as an effective delivery approach of NO to deep lung to prevent/reduce ARDS associated inflammation and cell injuries. This information is particularly useful to treat severe ARDS due to COVID-19 infection.

This article highlights the significance of mobility in realizing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines; even with large-scale vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, are still required to contain the transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Vaccinations, Mobility and COVID-19 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To compare trends and undertake statistical analyses of differences in public health performance (confirmed cases and fatalities) of Nordic countries; Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, and New Zealand, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Per capita trends in total cases and per capita fatalities were analysed and difference-in-difference statistical tests undertaken to assess whether differences in stringency of mandated social distancing (SD) measures, testing rates and border closures explain cross-country differences. Results: Sweden is a statistical outlier, relative to its Nordic neighbours, for both per capita cases and per capita fatalities associated with COVID-19 but not in terms of the reduction in economic growth. Sweden's public health differences, compared to its Nordic neigbours, are partially explained by differences in terms of international border closures and the level of stringency of SD measures (including testing) implemented from early March to June 2020. Conclusions: We find that: one, early imposition of full international travel restrictions combined with high levels of government-mandated stringency of SD reduced the per capita cases and per capita fatalities associated with COVID-19 in 2020 in the selected countries and, two, in Nordic countries, less stringent government-mandated SD is not associated with higher quarterly economic growth.","output":"Statistical Analyses of the Public Health and Economic Performance of Nordic Countries in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caregivers of dogs with epilepsy experience severe stress due to unpredictable seizures. Hence, they feel the need for a better management strategy. A seizure detection system (SDS), which can identify seizures and provide notifications to caregivers immediately, is required to address this issue. The current study aimed to establish a wearable automatic SDS using acceleration data and the Mahalanobis distance and to preliminarily investigate its feasibility among dogs. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) was targeted because it is the most common type of seizure and can have serious consequences (i.e., status epilepticus). This study comprised three phases. First, the reference datasets of epileptic and non-epileptic activities were established using acceleration data of GTCSs in 3 dogs and daily activities in 27 dogs. Second, the GTCS-detecting algorithm was created using the reference datasets and was validated using other acceleration data of GTCSs in 4 epileptic dogs and daily activities in 27 dogs. Third, a feasibility test of the SDS prototype was performed in three dogs with epilepsy. The algorithm was effective in identifying all acceleration data of GTCSs as seizures and all acceleration data of daily activities as non-seizure activities. Dogs with epilepsy were monitored with the prototype for 48-72 h, and three GTCSs were identified. The prototype detected all GTCSs accurately. A false positive finding was not obtained unless the accelerometer was displaced. Hence, a method that can detect epileptic seizures, particularly GTCSs, was established. Nevertheless, further large-scale studies must be conducted before the method can be commercialized.","output":"Detection of Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures in Dogs With a Seizure Detection System Established Using Acceleration Data and the Mahalanobis Distance: A Preliminary Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Vaccination is one of the most significant public health achievements of humanity. However, a significant portion of the population remains hesitant about vaccine safety, efficacy, and necessity. This study aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccination intention and factors affecting their decision among the general population in the Kurdistan region, Iraq. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during (April-May 2021), and a total of 1171 participants provided complete and valid answers were enrolled. Data collection was done through online questionnaire through Google Forms. We used binary regression analysis to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention. Results: The majority (53.6%) of the participants were female. Willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine was low (33 %) of the participants. We found that vaccine hesitancy/resistance was high which was evident for (32%) and (34.9%) of surveyed populations, respectively. Vaccination intention may associate with age, education, and occupation. Furthermore, several factors were associated with hesitancy/resistance: Adverse effects of the vaccine and loss of family members during the pandemic. Conclusions: More than half of the study participants refused or were hesitant to have the COVID-19 vaccine, so that Governments and health authorities should improve communication and increase trust.

Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples from hospitalized patients with critical COVID-19 (n = 37) and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (n = 20). Decreased bacterial diversity, a reduction in commensal bacteria, and high abundance of pathogenic bacteria were observed in patients compared to negative controls. Several bacterial species and metabolic pathways were associated with better respiratory status and lower inflammation. Strong correlations were found between species biomarkers and metabolic pathways associated with better clinical outcome, especially Moraxella lincolnii and pathways of vitamin K(2) biosynthesis. Our study demonstrates correlations between the URT microbiome and COVID-19 patient outcomes; further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to explore the causal roles of the identified microbiome biomarkers in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"Characterization of the Upper Respiratory Bacterial Microbiome in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine, more novel in provision of pediatric care, rapidly expanded due to the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Studies show that COVID-19 adversely impacts pregnant and peripartum women in the general population, but experiences among women in the first year after delivery/in the wider postpartum period remain unexplored. Moreover, experiences among women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking; though it is a group with a potential high need for support after delivery. The aim of our study was to investigate (i) how women with recent GDM experienced COVID-19 and the first lockdown in Denmark, and (ii) the womens risk perception and health literacy in terms of interaction with the healthcare system in relation to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study among 11 women with recent GDM (infants aged 2-11 months old). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in April-May 2020 by telephone or Skype for Business, when Denmark was under lockdown. We analysed data using a thematic qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: i) Everyday life and family well-being, ii) Worries about COVID-19 and iii) Health literacy: Health information and access to healthcare. The women were generally not worried about their own or their infants risk of COVID-19. The lockdown had a negative impact on everyday life e.g. routines, loneliness, breastfeeding uncertainties and worries for the infants social well-being; but better family dynamics were also described. It was challenging to maintain healthy behaviours and thus the women described worries for the risk of type 2 diabetes and GDM in subsequent pregnancies. The women missed peer support and face-to-face visits from health visitors and found it difficult to navigate the restructured care with online/telephone set-ups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and the lockdown affected everyday life among women with recent GDM both positively and negatively. Our findings suggest a need for care that are responsive to psychological and social aspects of health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and support to limit worries about adaptation to motherhood and the infants social well-being. Communication focusing on the importance and relevance of contacting healthcare providers should also be strengthened.","output":"The experience of women with recent gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 lockdown: a qualitative study from Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To summarize currently available evidence on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).Material and methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CBMdisc were searched for studies reporting maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 published from 1 January 2020 to 26 March 2020. The protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/34ZAV).Results: In total, 18 studies comprising 114 pregnant women were included in the review. Fever (87.5%) and cough (53.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by fatigue (22.5%), diarrhea (8.8%), dyspnea (11.3%), sore throat (7.5%), and myalgia (16.3%).

This study presents a proposal for regulatory management based on our analysis of the data available from the national regulatory agencies of Latin America on the total post-approval changes evaluated, and the time spent in the process. A retrospective search on the official websites of competent national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of 14 Latin American countries (Mxico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Panam, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile and Brazil) was conducted to collect data on post-approval changes in the last 4C6 years, up to January 2021. The NRAs considered were Brazil, Mxico, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Our analysis was focused on the post-approval changes that required approval before implementation, those that were submitted, and those that were submitted and approved for small molecules, biologics, and biotechnological products. The results indicated differences in the regulatory processes and procedures applied by the different agencies. We also found that the implementation of the PACs was directly impacted by limited resources, which puts the medication supply for chronic treatments at risk resulting in serious consequences for patients. For local decision-making, Latin American NRAs should implement regulatory pathways already made by regulatory agencies included in the World Health Organization Listed Authorities on PAC approval to optimize their resources and to ensure the continuity of medicine supply for their patients.","output":"A Proposal of a Combined Convergence Regulatory Strategy Applied to Post-approval Changes by Latin American Countries, Reducing Workload and Allowing Continuous Improvement to Guarantee the Quality, Safety, and Efficacy of Medicines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper seeks to evaluate and calibrate data collected by low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors in different environments and using different aggregated temporal units (i.e., 5-s, 1-min, 10-min, 30 min intervals).

By comparing the collected PM concentrations, we found high linearity and correlation between the data reported by the AirBeam2 sensors in different environments. Furthermore, the results suggest that the accuracy and bias of the PM data reported by the AirBeam2 sensors are affected by rainy weather and environments with high humidity and a high level of hygroscopic salts (i.e., a seaside location). In addition, increasing the aggregation level of the temporal units (i.e., from 5-s to 30 min intervals) increases the correlation between the PM concentrations obtained by the AirBeam2 sensors, while it does not significantly improve the accuracy and bias of the data. Lastly, our results indicate that using a machine learning model (i.e., random forest) for the calibration of PM concentrations collected on sunny days generates better results than those obtained with multiple linear models.

To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons.Results: Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false-positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active P. falciparum infection.

In this study, we evaluated the most frequent neurological symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and also investigated the possible relationship between plasmatic inflammatory indices and olfactory disorders (ODs) and between muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A structured questionnaire concerning typical and neurological symptoms, focusing on headache, dizziness, ODs, taste disorders (TDs), and muscle pain, was administrated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Common neurological symptoms were reported in the early phase of the disease, with a median onset ranging from 1 to 3 days. Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs. Muscle pain did not show any association with CK level but was more frequently associated with arthralgia and headache. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, ODs were an early symptom of COVID-19, more frequently reported by patients with milder forms of disease.

The protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes therapy primarily because it inactivates glucagon-like protein-1. DPP4 also has roles in steatosis, insulin resistance, cancers and inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In addition, DPP4 binds to the spike protein of the MERS virus, causing it to be the human cell surface receptor for that virus. DPP4 has been identified as a potential binding target of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, so this question requires experimental investigation. Understanding protein structure and function requires reliable protocols for production and purification. We developed such strategies for baculovirus generated soluble recombinant human DPP4 (residues 29C766) produced in insect cells. Purification used differential ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, dye affinity chromatography in series with immobilised metal affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. The binding affinities of DPP4 to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were measured using surface plasmon resonance and ELISA. This optimised DPP4 purification procedure yielded 1 to 1.8 mg of pure fully active soluble DPP4 protein per litre of insect cell culture with specific activity >30 U/mg, indicative of high purity. No specific binding between DPP4 and CoV-2 spike protein was detected by surface plasmon resonance or ELISA. In summary, a procedure for high purity high yield soluble human DPP4 was achieved and used to show that, unlike MERS, SARS-CoV-2 does not bind human DPP4.","output":"A Novel Purification Procedure for Active Recombinant Human DPP4 and the Inability of DPP4 to Bind SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A time series is a collection of measurements in chronological order. Discovering patterns from time series is useful in many domains, such as stock analysis, disease detection, and weather forecast. To discover patterns, existing methods often convert time series data into another form, such as nominal/symbolic format, to reduce dimensionality, which inevitably deviates the data values. Moreover, existing methods mainly neglect the order relationships between time series values. To tackle these issues, inspired by order-preserving matching, this paper proposes an Order-Preserving sequential Pattern (OPP) mining method, which represents patterns based on the order relationships of the time series data. An inherent advantage of such representation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by the relative order of the values underneath the time series data. To obtain frequent trends in time series, we propose the OPP-Miner algorithm to mine patterns with the same trend (sub-sequences with the same relative order). OPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate the support and uses pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. To compress the result set, we also study finding the maximal OPPs. Experiments validate that OPP-Miner is not only efficient and scalable but can also discover similar sub-sequences in time series. In addition, case studies show that our algorithms have high utility in analyzing the COVID-19 epidemic by identifying critical trends and improve the clustering performance.","output":"OPP-Miner: Order-preserving sequential pattern mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgery in the era of the current COVID-19 pandemic has been curtailed and restricted to emergency and certain oncological indications, and requires special attention concerning the safety of patients and health care personnel.

The COVID-19 burden in rural settings in Latin America is unclear. We performed a cross-sectional, population-based, random-selection SARS-CoV-2 serologic study during March 2021 in the rural population of San Martin region, northern Peru. In total, 563 persons from 288 houses across 10 provinces were enrolled, reaching 0.2% of the total rural population of San Martin. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was done using a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and reactive sera were confirmed using a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Validation of the testing algorithm using prepandemic sera from two regions of Peru showed false-positive results in the CLIA (23/84 sera; 27%) but not in the sVNT, highlighting the pitfalls of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in tropical regions and the high specificity of the two-step algorithm used in this study. An overall 59.0% seroprevalence (95% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 63%) corroborated intense SARS-CoV-2 spread in San Martin. Seroprevalence rates between the 10 provinces varied from 41.3 to 74.0% (95% CI, 30 to 84%). Higher seroprevalence was not associated with population size, population density, surface area, mean altitude, or poverty index in Spearman correlations. Seroprevalence and reported incidence diverged substantially between provinces, suggesting regional biases of COVID-19 surveillance data. Potentially, limited health care access due to environmental, economic, and cultural factors might lead to undetected infections in rural populations. Additionally, test avoidance to evade mandatory quarantine might affect rural regions more than urban regions. Serologic diagnostics should be pursued in resource-limited settings to inform country-level surveillance and vaccination strategies and to support control measures for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Latin America is a global hot spot of the COVID-19 pandemic. Serologic studies in Latin America have been mostly performed in urban settings. Rural populations comprise 20% of the total Latin American population. Nevertheless, information on COVID-19 spread in rural settings is scarce. Using a representative population-based seroprevalence study, we detected a high seroprevalence in rural populations in San Martin, northern Peru, in 2021, reaching 41 to 74%. However, seroprevalence and reported incidence diverged substantially between regions, potentially due to limited health care access or test avoidance due to mandatory quarantine. Our results suggest that rural populations are highly affected by SARS-CoV-2 even though they are sociodemographically distinct from urban populations and that highly specific serological diagnostics should be performed in resource-limited settings to support public health strategies of COVID-19 control.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Rural Peru, 2021: a Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are recognized as having significant social, economic and ecological costs, threatening human health, food security, wildlife conservation and biodiversity.

Study of the IUCN's list of the world's worst invaders reveals that disease is cited as a driver behind the conservation, medical or economic impact of nearly a quarter of the species on the data base. 3.

Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites. 4. The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where hostCparasite co\\\\evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts. 5.

METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 chronic disease patients from July 01 to August 30, 2020 at Aksum Hospital, Northern Ethiopia. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses with 95% confidence intervals were fitted to identify factors associated with poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to determine the prevalence of the association between the dependent and independent variables. A P-value < 0.05 was identified as statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 422 participants participated in this study, with a 100% response rate. The prevalence of poor knowledge, poor practice and unfavorable attitude was 35.1, 48.8, and 40.5%, respectively.

Web-based CPD plays an essential role. However, validated theoryCinformed measures of their impact are lacking. The CPD-REACTION questionnaire is a validated theoryCinformed tool that evaluates the impact of CPD activities on clinicians behavioral intentions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review the use of the CPD-REACTION questionnaire, which measures the impact of CPD activities on health professionals intentions to change clinical behavior. We examined CPD activity characteristics, ranges of intention, mean scores, score distributions, and psychometric properties. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review informed by the Cochrane review methodology. We searched 8 databases from January 1, 2014, to April 20, 2021. Gray literature was identified using Google Scholar and Research Gate. Eligibility criteria included all health care professionals, any study design, and participants completion of the CPD-REACTION questionnaire either before, after, or before and after a CPD activity. Study selection, data extraction, and study quality evaluation were independently performed by 2 reviewers. We extracted data on characteristics of studies, the CPD activity (eg, targeted clinical behavior and format), and CPD-REACTION use. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. Data extracted were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Student t test (2-tailed) for bivariate analysis. The results are presented as a narrative synthesis reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RESULTS: Overall, 65 citations were eligible and referred to 52 primary studies. The number of primary studies reporting the use of CPD-REACTION has increased continuously since 2014 from 1 to 16 publications per year (2021). It is available in English, French, Spanish, and Dutch. Most of the studies were conducted in Canada (30/52, 58%). Furthermore, 40 different clinical behaviors were identified. The most common CPD format was e-learning (34/52, 65%). The original version of the CPD-REACTION questionnaire was used in 31 of 52 studies, and an adapted version in 18 of 52 studies. In addition, 31% (16/52) of the studies measured both the pre- and postintervention scores. In 22 studies, CPD providers were university-based. Most studies targeted interprofessional groups of health professionals (31/52, 60%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPD-REACTION has increased rapidly and across a wide range of clinical behaviors and formats, including a web-based format. Further research should investigate the most effective way to adapt the CPD-REACTION questionnaire to a variety of clinical behaviors and contexts.

As a clinical consequence, patients with CLL frequently present with autoimmune phenomena, increased risk of infections and second malignancies. The aim of this review article is to present available data on CLL-associated alterations of immune parameters that correlate with known prognostic markers and with clinical outcome. Also, data on the impact of immune-related clinical manifestations on the prognosis of patients with CLL will be discussed. ABSTRACT: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a wide spectrum of immune alterations, affecting both the innate and adaptive immunity. These immune dysfunctions strongly impact the immune surveillance, facilitate tumor progression and eventually affect the disease course. Quantitative and functional alterations involving conventional T cells, æ T cells, regulatory T cells, NK and NKT cells, and myeloid cells, together with hypogammaglobulinemia, aberrations in the complement pathways and altered cytokine signature have been reported in patients with CLL. Some of these immune parameters have been shown to associate with other CLL-related characteristics with a known prognostic relevance or to correlate with disease prognosis. Also, in CLL, the complex immune response dysfunctions eventually translate in clinical manifestations, including autoimmune phenomena, increased risk of infections and second malignancies. These clinical issues are overall the most common complications that affect the course and management of CLL, and they also may impact overall disease prognosis.","output":"Impact of Immune Parameters and Immune Dysfunctions on the Prognosis of Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To quantify the change in heart failure (HF) hospitalizations observed in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic across a large, multi-center health care system. Methods MHealth Fairview encompasses four hospitals (one academic, three community-based) in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metro area. To compare HF hospitalization trends, two inpatient samples were created using HF discharges in the following time periods: pre COVID-19 (February 28, 2019-February 28, 2020) and post COVID-19 (April 1, 2020- May 15, 2020). March 2020 was excluded as this represented a transition point of the pandemic in the United States. Average number of discharges per day as well as demographics, diagnosis related group (DRG) codes, and inpatient mortality was then compared between the two inpatient HF samples. Results The pre COVID-19 group had 2,601 patients with an average of 7.1 (+/-3) discharges per day. The post COVID-19 group had 210 patients with an average of 4.7 (+/-1.7) discharges per day, which represented a 34% reduction in HF discharges (p <0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the pre and post COVID-19 inpatient samples with respect to age (76 vs. 75 years, p = 0.25), gender (46% vs. 48% male, p = 0.7), and DRG codes (DRG 291: 78% vs. 85% p = 0.15). Inpatient HF mortality pre and post COVID-19 was not significantly different (3% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.99). Conclusion HF hospitalizations have decreased significantly during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in this multi-center health care system, however the make-up of hospitalized patients remains similar. There is an urgent need to provide continued access to safe hospital care during the pandemic and to inform HF patients that inpatient care remains available.","output":"Heart Failure Hospitalization Trends During the Early Phase of the COVID 19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Work organization and relationships have changed over recent decades. Following the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the norms concerning work-related standards will likely change even more significantly. There has been a shift away from standard employment to non-standard employment (NSE), which includes fixed-term, part-time, on-call, agency-related employment, dependent self-employment, dispatch, and temporary employment, etc. in nearly every sector. The health sector is no exception. However, the effects of non-standard employment on the disaster preparedness of health systems, particularly on hospitals emergency and disaster plans, have not yet been adequately studied. Most crucial themes are engagement of non-standard employees in emergency and disaster planning and response, and the impact of non-standard employees in expanding hospitals capacity in large-scale events. This short communication paper aims to discuss this neglected issue in hospital emergency and disaster planning. In order to see whether NSE is considered in hospital disaster and emergency plans, two hospital disaster and emergency planning guidelinesthe Hospital Incident Command System, and the Hospital Emergency Response Checklist developed by the World Health Organizationwere assessed regarding NSE in their respective contexts. Although these guidelines are comprehensive tools for hospital preparedness, NSE is not specifically considered in any of them. However, it is essential that NSE, with its trade-offs, is considered in disaster plans to maintain an effective implementation of them. Further research and actions are necessary, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify how this reflection should be conducted and to supply evidence for further measures and revising emergency and disaster planning guidelines.","output":"A Neglected Issue in Hospital Emergency and Disaster Planning: Non-standard Employment in Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent years have shown a tremendous increase and diversification in antibody-based therapeutics with advances in production techniques and formats.

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.

Considering the individual-level antecedents only higher physical demands predicted higher absence duration. Presenteeism related positively to physical demands, a burdensome social environment, and organizational identification and negatively to ease of replacement, and core self-evaluations. These relationships were similar for HLPT as outcome. Regarding unit-level factors, preceding unit-level absence frequency (but not duration) negatively related to presenteeism. The negative relationship between core self-evaluations and individual presenteeism decreased under a stronger presenteeism context supporting the hypothesized cross-level effect of unit-level presenteeism context strength.

Ambulatory clinic visits were replaced by the implementation of telehealth modalities in most of IBD units during the pandemic lockdown. However, the efficacy, efficiency, and patients acceptability of using telemedicine by telephone consultation has not been evaluated. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in IBD patients who underwent telephone consultation during lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic between 16(th) march and 13(th) April 2020. To assess the efficacy of this telephone consultation (COVID-visit), change in diseases activity and treatment, non-scheduled visits, emergency consultation, hospital admission and non-elective surgery from COVID-visit to the next scheduled consultation (postCOVID-visit) were checked. To evaluate efficiency, the time period between COVID-visit and postCOVID-visit were compared with previous consultation (preCOVID-visit). Only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD, regular follow-up in our IBD unit and with full available requested test results were included. A telephone survey was designed (5 questions) and conducted in all patients to rate satisfaction for using telemedicine. RESULTS: Out of a total of 274 patients, 220 patients (52.2% male; mean age 4916 years; crohns disease n=126/ ulcerative colitis n=83/ indeterminate colitis n=11) were included. During the COVID-visit 41% patients were using biologic agents, 15% had active disease and 6.8% changed treatment (40% initiated corticosteroids; 30% started immunomodulators or biologic agents; 30% upgraded usual treatment). Only 1 patient consulted at the emergency department, 11 patients needed to rearrange the visit and none patient underwent surgery before the scheduled post-COVID visit. The interval to post- COVID visit compared to pre-COVID visit was reduced in 28.6%, remained equal in 33.6% and increased in 37.7% of patients. The satisfaction survey (n=185) revealed that 81.1% patients rated care as excellent, 94.6% perceived it was effective and solved doubts in 96.2% of patients. However, 44.4% of patients rather prefer on-site consultation for follow-up and only 52% considered that incorporating video would improve care. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine care during the lockdown and despite been abruptly and rapidly implemented in IBD units, shows to be effective and efficient to care IBD patients. In addition, telephone consultation is well accepted by patients for short follow-up periods. Further follow-up studies should be carried out to determine the patient profile that will benefit most from this monitoring.","output":"P541 Efficacy, efficiency and aceptability of telemedicine for inflammatory bowel disease patients follow-up care during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use credit card data from the Federal Reserve Board's FR Y-14M reports to study the impact of the COVID-19 shock on the use and availability of consumer credit across borrower types from March through August 2020.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women were categorized into two sets as asymptomatic and symptomatic according to their clinics at the time of application. COVID-19 was diagnosed using the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were compared in terms of maternal and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: Our study population consisted of 20 asymptomatic and 41 symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The rate of primary cesarean section was more than twice in the symptomatic group (51.2%) than that of the asymptomatic group (20%) (p=0.019). Both groups are quite similar in terms of maternal [respiratory support, COVID-19-related treatment, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission], perinatal (preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membrane, preeclampsia, and mode of delivery), and neonatal outcomes [birth weight, Apgar scores, neonatal ICU (NICU) admission]. The rate of total cesarean section in the asymptomatic group (75%) was statistically similar to the symptomatic group (83%) (p=0.464). The NICU admission rate was found to be similar in the asymptomatic (54.2%) and symptomatic groups (50%) (p=0.858).

Instead, in both males and females, numerous hemocytes surround the acini. Among hemocytes, two types of granulocytes and erythrocytes were identified. Bundles of muscle cells were also found in the interacinar space. Male intraacinar accessory cells were rather large, glycogen-rich, with lipid inclusions, and phagosomes contained spermatogenic cells. Female accessory cells had well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, but they did not form any follicles around oocytes, being in their basal part, closer to basal lamina. Such a specific pattern of gonad organization can presumably be explained by both symbiosis with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and phylogenetic aspects that should be further studied. Some evidence for continuous gametogenesis are discussed.","output":"Microscopic anatomy of gonadal area in the deep-sea clam Calyptogena pacifica (Bivalvia: Vesicomyidae) with emphasis on somatic cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens is still performed by phenotypic methods that are often slow and cumbersome, despite the availability of more comprehensive genotyping technologies. We present an approach based on whole\\\\genome amplification and resequencing microarrays for unbiased pathogen detection. This 10 h process identifies a broad spectrum of bacterial and viral species and predicts antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity and virulence profiles. We successfully identify a variety of bacteria and viruses, both in isolation and in complex mixtures, and the high specificity of the microarray distinguishes between different pathogens that cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants. We identify organisms by hybridization of their DNA in as little as 1C4 h. Using this method, we identified Monkeypox virus and drug\\\\resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion taken from a child suspected of an orthopoxvirus infection, despite poor transport conditions of the sample, and a vast excess of human DNA. Our results suggest this technology could be applied in a clinical setting to test for numerous pathogens in a rapid, sensitive and unbiased manner.","output":"Massively parallel pathogen identification using high\\\\density microarrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of anxiety and depression among LGBTQ college students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine pandemic-related stressors and protective factors.

We hypothesized that delivery of extracellular vesicles (EVs), recognized for their potential as therapeutic targets and tools, could restore vascular function in atherosclerosis. We explored by comparison the potential beneficial effects of EVs from subcutaneous adipose tissue stem cells (EVs (ADSCs)) or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (EVs (MSCs)) on the consequences of atherogenic diet on vascular health. Also, the influences of siRNA-targeting Smad2/3 (Smad2/3siRNA) on endothelial dysfunction and its key molecular players were analyzed. For this study, an animal model of atherosclerosis (HH) was transplanted with EVs (ADSCs) or EVs (MSCs) transfected or not with Smad2/3siRNA. For controls, healthy or HH animals were used. The results indicated that by comparison with the HH group, the treatment with EVs(ADSCs) or EVs(MSCs) alone or in combination with Smad2/3siRNA of HH animals induced a significant decrease in the main plasma parameters and a noticeable improvement in the structure and function of the thoracic aorta and carotid artery along with a decrease in the selected molecular and cellular targets mediating their changes in atherosclerosis: 1) a decrease in expression of structural and inflammatory markers COL1A1, -SMA, Cx43, VCAM-1, and MMP-2; 2) a slight infiltration of total/M1 macrophages and T-cells; 3) a reduced level of cytosolic ROS production; 4) a significant diminution in plasma concentrations of TGF-1 and Ang II proteins; 5) significant structural and functional improvements (thinning of the arterial wall, increase of the inner diameter, enhanced distensibility, diminished VTI and Vel, and augmented contractile and relaxation responses); 6) a reduced protein expression profile of Smad2/3, ATF-2, and NF-kBp50/p65 and a significant decrease in the expression levels of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-192, miR-200b, miR-210, and miR-146a. We can conclude that 1) stem cell-derived EV therapies, especially the EVs (ADSCs) led to regression of structural and functional changes in the vascular wall and of key orchestrator expression in the atherosclerosis-induced endothelial dysfunction; 2) transfection of EVs with Smad2/3siRNA amplified the ability of EVs(ADSCs) or EVs(MSCs) to regress the inflammation-mediated atherosclerotic process.","output":"Therapeutic Potential of Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles on Atherosclerosis-Induced Vascular Dysfunction and Its Key Molecular Players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of coronavirus SARS-Cov2 (COVID-19) confinement measures in Colombia on the dietary behaviors of a large population sample, at national and regional levels.

Dietary intake of foods and foods groups in grams per day before and during the confinement was estimated by considering standard serving sizes of foods. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between the regions with regard to dietary behavior changes during the confinement. Differences were deemed significant at p-value &lt; 0.05. Dietary patterns (DPs) before and during the confinement were derived from principal component analysis. Certain dietary habits were adopted by the study population during the confinement (e.g., higher frequency of snacking and home cooking), with significant differences by regions with regard to these habits, as well as regarding culinary processes. The levels of consumption of several foods also changed during the confinement, nationally and regionally. We identified three DPs before the confinement (protein-rich, carbohydrate-rich, and sugar foods patterns) and four DPs during the confinement (westernized, carbohydrate-rich, protein-rich, fish and fruits-vegetable patterns), with an explained total variance of 33 and 45%, respectively. The profile of these DPs varied to some extent between the regions;their adherence to each DP also varied (p-value &lt; 0.001).

More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help. This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. This easily disseminable video-based intervention has the potential to increase likelihood of seeking care.

With this, new situation comes many psychological challenges not only for health care workers and people suffering from COVID-19 but also for the general population. Adapting to the new situation can be demanding. Experts have suggested that emotions during this situation are very similar to grief, and people experience emptiness and sadness about the loss of their normal lives, which can even lead to a loss of meaning in life. In this paper, we argue that life crafting could offer a way to help people cope with the situation and renew their sense of meaning. A life crafting intervention is based on theoretical insights from multiple areas of research, like positive psychology, expressive writing, and the salutogenesis framework. Life-crafting interventions help people find meaning in life by focusing on their ideal future, and helping them set goals, and make concrete plans to achieve those goals and overcome obstacles. Since having a clear purpose or meaning in life has been shown to have many benefits, we propose that it can also help people to cope with the psychological effects of the pandemic.

The aim of this study is to analyze the search interests for oral cancer using mouth cancer, tongue cancer, gum cancer, and lip cancer as common keywords. METHODS: Internet searches relating to oral cancer from 2010 to 2020, from 250 countries and dependent areas, were retrieved from Google Trends. Color densities in a heat map were used to show geographic differences. Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunns analysis was used to perform yearly comparisons of searches for mouth cancer, tongue cancer, gum cancer, and lip cancer. Search results within 2020 were also compared to determine differences. Forecasting searches from 2021 to 2022 were done by fitting time series models. RESULTS: From 29 of 250 (11.6%) countries, the highest search values were observed for mouth cancer in Sri Lanka, Qatar, Bangladesh, Finland, Netherlands, Spain, and France. Compared to 2020, greater searches were seen in 2018 (Mdn = 91%, P = 0.023) and 2019 (Mdn = 94%, P = 0.012) for mouth cancer, and 2019 (Mdn = 17%, P = 0.035) for lip cancer. The relative search volumes for gum cancer and lip cancer were substantially lower than mouth cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next-generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is predicted to have high antigenicity, safety, and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants, were utilized to construct a multi-epitope-vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with a high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product.

If an astrophysically compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational lensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In this paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the time arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and then progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of the time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by brighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The growing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs, which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal resolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of microlensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational lens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.","output":"Gravitational Microlensing Time Delays at High Optical Depth: Image Parities and the Temporal Properties of Fast Radio Bursts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur.

METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION After removal of duplicates from a combined EndNote library of results, 490 articles were reviewed using Covidence software. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and then screened full texts. Selection criteria included articles that reported radical trachelectomy with lymph node assessment as primary therapy for cervical carcinoma, with stated follow-up intervals and recurrences. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Variables of interest were manually extracted into an electronic database. A total 47 articles that reported on 2,566 women met inclusion criteria. Most tumors were of squamous histology (68.5%), stage IB1 (74.8%), 2 cm or less (69.2%), and without lymphovascular invasion (68.8%). Of planned trachelectomies, 9% were converted intraoperatively to hysterectomy. Separated by route of trachelectomy, 58.1%, 37.2%, and 4.7% were performed using radical vaginal, abdominal, and laparoscopic approaches, respectively. With median follow-up of 48 months (range 2-202 months) across studies, median recurrence rate was 3.3% (range 0-25%); median time to recurrence was 26 months (range 8-44 months).

High-spatial-resolution, age-specific risk mapping of this indicator can provide valuable information for health resource allocation. The age-prevalence relationships may be different among areas of the study region, but previous geostatistical models usually ignored the spatial-age interaction. METHODS: We took Guangdong province, the province with the largest population and economy in China, as a study case. We collected two-week illness data and other potential influencing predictors from the fifth National Health Services Survey in 2013 and other open-access databases. Bayesian geostatistical binary regression models were developed with spatial-age structured random effect, based on which, high-resolution, age-specific two-week illness prevalence rates, as well as number of people reporting two-week illness, were estimated. The equality of health resource distribution was further evaluated based on the two-week illness mapping results and the health supply data. RESULTS: The map across all age groups revealed that the highest risk was concentrated in the central (i.e., Pearl River Delta) and northern regions of the province. These areas had a two-week illness prevalence > 25.0%, compared with 10.0C20.0% in other areas. Age-specific maps revealed significant differences in prevalence between age groups, and the age-prevalence relationships also differed across locations. In most areas, the prevalence rates decrease from age 0 to age 20, and then increase gradually. Overall, the estimated age- and population-adjusted prevalence was 16.5% [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 14.5C18.6%], and the estimated total number of people reporting illness within the two-week period was 17.5 million (95% BCI: 15.5C19.8 million) in Guangdong Province. The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient (resulted in 0.3526) showed a moderate level of inequality in health resource distribution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a Bayesian geostatistical modeling framework with spatial-age structured effect to produce age-specific, high-resolution maps of the two-week illness prevalence rate and the numbers of people reporting two-week illness in Guangdong province. The methodology developed in this study can be generalized to other global regions with available relevant survey data. The mapping results will support plans for health resource allocation.

Almost overnight, practitioners were forced to transfer their face-to-face care practice to online means. To understand the implications of this drastic change for mental health care, and to improve the online care offerings, an online qualitative survey was held among mental health care professionals in Netherlands (n = 51). Our findings indicate that technological and usability problems pose a significant challenge, as do difficulties to establish rapport with clients. Moreover, not all mental health issues and treatment forms are equally amenable to online interaction. In contrast, in many instances, practitioners were positive about the effectiveness of treatment, and reported flexibility, a lower threshold for contact, and lack of travel time as advantages. Their most prominent needs concern better technological, organizational, and logistical support. It is critical that these needs are acted upon by institutions and governments.

However, the precise meaning of hotspot varies widely in current research and policy documents. Hotspots have been variously described as areas of elevated incidence or prevalence, higher transmission efficiency or risk, or higher probability of disease emergence. This ambiguity has led to confusion and may result in mistaken inferences regarding the best way to target interventions. We surveyed the literature on epidemiologic hotspots, examining the multitude of ways in which the term is used; and highlight the difference in the geographic scale of hotspots and the properties they are supposed to have. In response to the diversity in the term's usage, we advocate the use of more precise terms, such as burden hotspot, transmission hotspot, and emergence hotspot, as well as explicit specification of the spatiotemporal scale of interest.

This study aimed to evaluate the level of adherence to SCMs and associated factors among smokers and ex-smokers in Australia. Method: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Australia. Descriptive statistics were used to present the overall characteristics of participants. Cross-tabulation with Pearsons chi-square test was performed to evaluate the possible associations between factors. To explore barriers and facilitators of adherence to SCMs, logistic regressions were conducted. Results: Among 201 participants, 57 (28.4%) were found to be adherent to SCMs. The odds of being adherent were found to be higher among participants with good social support (AOR = 3.28, 95% CI of 2.30C6.27). Participants who did not experience anxiety symptoms had higher odds of being adherent to SCMs as compared to smokers who had anxiety symptoms (AOR = 4.41, 95% CI of 3.64C14.68). Having previous experience of using SCMs improved adherence four-fold (AOR = 3.87, 95% CI of 1.11C13.44).

The authors use sustainability in the broader socioecological sense, rather than meaning merely financial survival. Based upon experiences by various parties in dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or (C-19) during 2020 and into 2021, we are all driven to ask, Which lessons shall we learn? Design/methodology/approach: Based upon a brief review of environmental and management literature, the authors compare experiences with C-19 and those of socio-ecological sustainability to-date and distill both sources for optimism as well as pessimism in the face of technical and socio-political challenges. Findings: Historical experiences are not particularly encouraging, but there are many opportunities for great improvements if institutional and corporate leaders choose to learn from both C-19 experiences and earlier efforts toward sustainability. Practical implications: Procrastination by major industrialized economies in not taking major positive actions to control and reduce carbon pollution and other environmental damage is leading to human crisesChunger and thirst followed by migration, conflicts and healthcare system collapses. Organizational executives need to develop flexibility and embrace precautionary principles regarding many stakeholders if humanity is going to have a good chance of flourishing in the future.

Prior research has shown the negative consequences of an infodemic during the pandemic; however, we know less about which subpopulations are more exposed to the infodemic and are more vulnerable to the adverse psychological and behavioral effects. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how sociodemographic factors and information-seeking behaviors affect the perceived information overload during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigated the effect of perceived information overload on psychological distress and protective behavior and analyzed the socioeconomic differences in the effects. METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from a cross-national survey of residents in 6 jurisdictions in Asia in May 2020. The survey targeted residents aged 18 years or older. A probability-based quota sampling strategy was adopted to ensure that the selected samples matched the populations geographical and demographic characteristics released by the latest available census in each jurisdiction. The final sample included 10,063 respondents. Information overload about COVID-19 was measured by asking the respondents to what extent they feel overwhelmed by news related to COVID-19. The measure of psychological distress was adapted from the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). Protective behaviors included personal hygienic behavior and compliance with social distancing measures. RESULTS: Younger respondents and women (b=0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26) were more likely to perceive information overload. Participants self-perceived as upper or upper-middle class (b=0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30) and those with full-time jobs (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17) tended to perceive higher information overload. Respondents who more frequently sought COVID-19 information from newspapers (b=0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14), television (b=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), and family and friends (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14) were more likely to feel overwhelmed. In contrast, obtaining COVID-19 information from online news outlets and social media was not associated with perceived information overload. There was a positive relationship between perceived information overload and psychological distress (b=2.18, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.26). Such an association was stronger among urban residents, full-time employees, and those living in privately owned housing. The effect of perceived information overload on protective behavior was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that respondents who were younger, were female, had a higher socioeconomic status (SES), and had vulnerable populations in the household were more likely to feel overwhelmed by COVID-19 information. Perceived information overload tended to increase psychological distress, and people with higher SES were more vulnerable to this adverse psychological consequence. Effective policies and interventions should be promoted to target vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to the occurrence and negative psychological influence of perceived information overload.","output":"Stratified Impacts of the Infodemic During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey in 6 Asian Jurisdictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of foodborne diseases related to fresh produce have been increasing in North America and Europe.

In response, the Government of Nepal launched the Iron Intensification Programme (IIP) in 2003 to improve the coverage of IFA supplementation and anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy, as well as promote the utilization of antenatal care. This review examined how the IIP programme contributed to Nepal's success in increasing the consumption of IFA supplements during pregnancy. Nepal's cadre of Female Community Health Volunteers were engaged in the IIP to support the community-based distribution of IFA supplements to pregnant women and complement IFA distribution through health facilities and outreach services. As a result, the country achieved a fourfold increase in the proportion of women who took IFA supplements during pregnancy between 2001 and 2016 (from 23% to 91%) and a 12-fold increase in the proportion who took IFA supplements for at least 90 days during pregnancy (from 6% to 71%). The increase in coverage of IFA supplements accompanied an increase in the coverage of antenatal care during the same period. By 2016, the prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women decreased to 46%, highlighting the need to tackle other causes of anaemia and improve haemoglobin concentration before pregnancy, while maintaining the successful efforts to reach pregnant women with IFA supplements at the community level.","output":"A review of the maternal iron and folic acid supplementation programme in Nepal: Achievements and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To determine the influence of high-efficacy disease modifying therapy (DMT) on the development of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).

On this occasion, a scientific study of five paintings from the artists time in Paris (1948C1953) revealed her pioneering use of solvent-based acrylic paints in post-war Europe. This article presents a second phase of research into Herreras work aiming to shed light on her studio practice and ascertain the possible presence of other early acrylic paints in her pre-1963 artistic production. A selection of four paintings, namely Iberia #25 (1948), Iberic (1949), Flights of Colors #16 (1949), and Early Dynasty (1953), was subjected to an analytical campaign that relied on both non-invasive and micro-invasive techniques. Results confirmed the use of both oil and solvent-based acrylic paints, supporting our primary research and uncovering the first-known occurrence of acrylic binders in Herreras Iberia #25. In all cases, the ground layer consists of a mixture of titanium white in its tetragonal form of rutile, anhydrite, and talc, while the color palette was found to be based on both traditional and modern pigments. In most areas, several paint layers appeared to be overlaid on top of one another, revealing a creative process that developed through subsequent compositions. Remnants of earlier paint layers, which appeared to have been scraped off before new ones were applied, were observed directly above the ground in some of the samples examined. In addition, Iberia #25 and Iberic, with analogous geometric and chromatic schemes, underwent technical imaging, which exposed pencil lines and notes underneath the paint layers likely indicative of the intended design and polychromy. Besides corroborating a major alteration in the current scholarship on the availability and use of acrylic-based artists paints in post-war Europe, this research provides new insights into Herreras materials, techniques, and studio practice.

In turn, universal precautions rely on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). During the SARS-CoV2 outbreak many healthcare workers across the globe have been reluctant to provide patient care because crucial PPE components are in short supply. The lack of such equipment during the pandemic was not a result of careful resource allocation decisions in the global north, where the short supply could be explained through their high cost. Instead, they were the result of democratically elected governments prioritising low tax regimes over an adequate resourcing of their healthcare delivery systems. Such decisions were made despite global health experts warning about the high probability of pandemics like SARS-CoV2 occurring during our lifetimes. Avoidable allocation decisions by democratically elected political leaders resulted in a lack of sufficient PPE for healthcare professionals. After discussing and discounting various ethical arguments in support of a professional obligation to treat, even without or with suboptimal PPE, I conclude that these policy decisions were sufficiently grave that they provide a sound ethical rationale to justify healthcare workers' refusal to provide care to infected patients.","output":"What healthcare professionals owe us: why their duty to treat during a pandemic is contingent on personal protective equipment (PPE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide problem.

Literacy rates and expected years of schooling for females, femicide, lifetime prevalence of violence, and several indicators of women's health were found to be strongly and significantly related to increased estimated prevalence of modern slavery. Furthermore, we propose that the pandemic has increased vulnerability to exploitation for women and girls by regressing progress across all areas addressed by SDG-5.

Periodic lockdown and stay-at-home orders have exacerbated the situation. In this social climate, urban green spaces have attained a high significance for the maintenance of the physical and mental health of the population. Given the presence of similar coronaviruses in animal populations, it can be predicted that future epidemics and even pandemics will occur. Urban planning needs to incorporate the lessons learnt during COVID-19 in order to future-proof our communities. This paper reviews the role that urban green spaces played during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these observations, the paper discusses a range of options for the provision of pandemic-sensitive spaces for physical exercise and mental recreation. Design concepts for long-term planning adjustments as well as for future ad-hoc solutions are provided. These include the provision of social distancing 'pods' embedded in design and landscaping of permanent parks, the design of ad-hoc, socially distanced 'parklets' on a quietened street and a rethink of the design of curb-to-boundary setbacks (nature strip) in residential streets.","output":"Exercising under COVID-2x: Conceptualizing Future Green Spaces in Australia's Neighborhoods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients lacking functional adenosine deaminase activity suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA SCID), which can be treated with ADA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or autologous HSCT with gene-corrected cells (gene therapy-GT).

Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics. DESIGN epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods. RESULTS the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones. CONCLUSIONS the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.","output":"[Did social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic have an impact on the lifestyles of citizens?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the maximum activity dose that can safely be administered is limited by high renal uptake and retention of radiolabelled peptides. The kidney radiation dose can be reduced by coinfusion of agents that competitively inhibit the reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides, such as positively charged amino acids, Gelofusine, or trypsinised albumin. The aim of this study was to identify more specific and potent inhibitors of the kidney reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides, based on albumin. METHODS Albumin was fragmented using cyanogen bromide and six albumin-derived peptides with different numbers of electric charges were selected and synthesised. The effect of albumin fragments (FRALB-C) and selected albumin-derived peptides on the internalisation of (111)In-albumin, (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide by megalin-expressing cells was assessed. In rats, the effect of Gelofusine and albumin-derived peptides on the renal uptake and biodistribution of (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide was determined. RESULTS FRALB-C significantly reduced the uptake of all radiolabelled peptides in vitro. The albumin-derived peptides showed different potencies in reducing the uptake of (111)In-albumin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-minigastrin in vitro. The most efficient albumin-derived peptide (peptide #6), was selected for in vivo testing. In rats, 5 mg of peptide #6 very efficiently inhibited the renal uptake of (111)In-minigastrin, by 88%. Uptake of (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide was reduced by 26 and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The albumin-derived peptide #6 efficiently inhibited the renal reabsorption of (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide and is a promising candidate for kidney protection in PRRT.","output":"Albumin-derived peptides efficiently reduce renal uptake of radiolabelled peptides."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After almost 2 years of Covid-19 pandemic-imposed online teaching, educators might wonder whether technology in education is indeed the future.

Of these, 219 (72%) were male, 199 (65%) had moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome and 113 (37%) did not survive more than 90 days. Latent class analysis identified three cardiovascular subphenotypes: class 1 (52%; normal right ventricular function); class 2 (31%; right ventricular dilation with mostly preserved systolic function); and class 3 (17%; right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment). The three subphenotypes differed in their clinical characteristics and response to prone ventilation and outcomes, with 90-day mortality rates of 22%, 42% and 73%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Neurosurgical volume was compared between these periods. Results A 40% reduction in weekly procedural volume was demonstrated during COVID-19 (median 75 [IQR 72-80] to 45 [43-47], p<0.001). There was a 42% reduction for weekly adult procedures (62 [54-70] to 36 [34-39], p<0.001), and 31% reduction for weekly pediatric procedures (13 [12-14] to 9 [8-10], p=0.004). Among adult procedures, the most significant decreases were seen for spine (p<0.001), endovascular (p<0.001), and cranioplasty (p<0.001).

Participants were recruited through community outreach, clinical registries, and research registries across four cities in Illinois to complete an online survey. We examined presence of symptoms among 246 individuals who were at least three months past testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Respondents were 70% female; 48% Hispanic/Latinx; 18% Black, and 28% White. Most had mild illness (78% were not hospitalized), and 26% reported they had not yet returned to their usual health within 3 months of their diagnosis. The most prevalent symptoms persisting 3-months following COVID-19 diagnosis included fatigue (20%), difficulty thinking (19%), problems with taste or smell (15%), and muscle or body aches (15%). In a multivariable logistic regression model, older age (40-59 vs. 18-39 years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.90]) and having been hospitalized with COVID-19 (vs. not hospitalized: aOR = 0.28 [0.12 to 0.64]) were independently associated with a lower likelihood of recovery within 3 months.

Methods: We recruited 1107 young people attending Australian primary mental health services, collecting data at two time points, three months apart. Five linear and three generalised linear models were explored to identify the best TTU algorithm. Forest models were used to explore predictive ability of six candidate measures of psychological distress, depression and anxiety and linear / generalised linear mixed effect models were used to construct longitudinal predictive models for AQoL-6D change. Results: A depression measure (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was the strongest independent predictor of health utility. Linear regression models with complementary log-log transformation of utility score were the best preforming models. Between-person associations were slightly larger than within-person associations for most of the predictors.

The coding order of the RNA-1 products was determined to be 5-p27-p57-p37-3. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and p57 immunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to p88, suggesting that p88 is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-1. In addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame, generating the observed p88 product. An RNA-1 expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, p88 can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data, we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an 88-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.","output":"Synthesis of the Putative Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic Virus RNA Polymerase by Ribosomal Frameshifting in Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study investigated how pediatric speech-language pathologists (SLPs) applied telepractice to compensate for the loss of in-person services and the dynamics of telepractice use during the COVID-19 pandemic in a rural state.

In the months right after the pandemic outbreak (i.e., March to May), client children struggled with treatment gains and behavioral wellbeing. However, their outcomes gradually improved by October to December and approached pre-pandemic levels. About one-third of the SLPs reported that they would be more likely or much more likely to use telepractice in the future regardless of the pandemic. However, only about a quarter perceived telepractice as comparable to in-person services. We concluded that the transition from in-person services to telepractice substantially mitigated service disruptions right after the pandemic outbreak and that telepractices substitute role evolved over time.","output":"The Evolution of Telepractice Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020, leading to some form of lockdown across almost all countries of the world. The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and 'flatten the curve' of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: A review of the global lockdown and its far-reaching effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods RESULTS: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19 The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87 8% (95% CI 81 5% to 92 2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18 4% to 96 1% and specificity 88 9% to 100% However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research","output":"Effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate lymphopenia as a marker for coronavirus disease severity, we conducted a meta-analysis of 10 studies.

Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved low risk patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand.","output":"New geographic model of care to manage the post-COVID-19 elective surgery aftershock in England: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We appreciate our Italian colleagues' interest in our editorial denoting the rheumatologist's role in helping to diagnose and treat cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in the setting of the Covid-19 panemic (1).

Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","output":"Impact of the societal response to COVID-19 on access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities of Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan: results of pre-COVID and COVID-19 lockdown stakeholder engagements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability and calculate the measurement error of the Trunk Assessment Scale for Spinal Cord Injury (TASS) and trunk control test (TCT-SCI) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Rehabilitation Hospital in Japan. METHODS: The evaluations of TASS and TCT-SCI for individuals with SCI were video-recorded. The inter-rater reliability (two physiotherapists) was confirmed using the videos. ICC (2,1), kappa coefficient () were used to determine the reliability of the total score and each item. Each minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated. RESULTS: The TASS and TCT-SCI total scores showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99, and 1.00). The kappa coefficients of TASS were acceptable to excellent for 8 items ( = 0.76-1.00), below acceptable for 1 item ( = 0.62). The kappa coefficients of TCT-SCI were excellent for 12 items ( = 0.83-1.00), below acceptable for 1 item ( = 0.68). The inter-rater MDC of the TASS total score was 4.07 points, and the MDC of the TCT-SCI total score was 1.13 points. The intra-rater MDC of the TASS total score was 3.86 points.

During the course of the epidemic, it has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified, which lead to incomplete case-detection. Apart from asymptomatic infections, possible reasons for incomplete case-detection are availability of test kits and changes in test policies during the course of the epidemic. So far, it has not been examined how biased the reported epidemiological measures are in the presence of incomplete case detection. In this work, we assess the four frequently used measures with respect to incomplete case-detection: 1) cumulative case-count, 2) incidence rate, 3) effective reproduction number and 4) doubling time. We apply an age-structured SIR model to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared. It turns out that the most frequently used epidemiological measure, the cumulative case count is most prone to bias in all of our settings. The effective reproduction number is the least biased measure. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend to use of the effective reproduction number for informing the general public and policy makers.","output":"Epidemiological measures for informing the general public during the SARS-CoV-2-outbreak: simulation study about bias by incomplete case-detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bone marrow contains heterogeneous population of cells that are involved in the regeneration and repair of diseased organs, including the lungs.

Phenotypically, these cells expressed the stem cell markers octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct4) and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), the alveolar stem cell marker Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp), and the epithelial cell markers pan-cytokeratin (Pan-K), cytokeratin-18 (K-18), and occludin. When cultured in epithelial cell growth medium, the progenitor epithelial cells expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers. Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to influenza virus. Progenitor epithelial cells expressed sialic acid receptors utilized by avian and mammalian influenza viruses and were targets for influenza virus replication. Additionally, differentiated type II but not type I pneumocytes supported the replication of influenza virus. Our data indicate that we have identified a unique population of progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow that might have airway reconstitution potential and may be a useful model for cell-based therapies for infectious and non-infectious lung diseases.","output":"Epithelial Cells Derived from Swine Bone Marrow Express Stem Cell Markers and Support Influenza Virus Replication In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly attacks the respiratory system and is characterized by pneumonia, cytokine storm, coagulation disorders and severe immune downregulation. Although public health experts predicted worst outcomes in Africa, the incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates have been lower in Africa compared to other continents. Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. It's unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role. Women of African descent have elevated levels of estrogen compared with Caucasians hence we anticipate that estrogen might offer some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This will as well provide useful information on how future pandemics could be managed using Africa as a case study.","output":"COVID-19 in Africa: an ovarian victory?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University students are predisposed to stress, which could be even higher in Nursing students since they are directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their health training and area of knowledge.

This was an observational and prospective study including Nursing students from the second year of the Nursing Degree from 3 February to 23 April 2020. Three measurements were performed: one before lockdown and two during lockdown. Stress increased substantially during lockdown. Financial, family or emotional problems, as well as physical exercise, also increased. Indeed, at 40 days of lockdown, those students with financial, family or emotional problems, and less physical exercise reported significantly higher stress levels. In addition, those who passed the online exam had lower stress levels compared to those who failed. In conclusion, during lockdown, stress in Nursing students increased. This could be triggered by students' personal problems, and physical exercise may be used as a way to reduce stress.

Risk factors for severe illness must be identified to make efficient resource allocations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for severe illness. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. SETTING: Single-institution. PARTICIPANTS: First 117 consecutive patients hospitalized for Covid-19 from March 1 to April 12, 2020. EXPOSURE: None. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Intensive care unit admission or death. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 24.8% and average total length of stay was 11.82 days (95% CI: 10.01 to 13.63 days). 30.8% of patients required intensive care unit admission and 29.1% required mechanical ventilation. Multivariate regression identified the amount of supplemental oxygen required at admission (OR: 1.208, 95% CI: 1.011-1.443, p = .037), sputum production (OR: 6.734, 95% CI: 1.630-27.812, p = .008), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (OR: 11.873, 95% CI: 2.218-63.555, p = .004) and chronic kidney disease (OR: 4.793, 95% CI: 1.528-15.037, p = .007) as significant risk factors for intensive care unit admission or death. Of the 48 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit or died, this occurred within 3 days of arrival in 42%, within 6 days in 71%, and within 9 days in 88% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: At our regional medical center, patients with Covid-19 had an average length of stay just under 12 days, required ICU care in 31% of cases, and had a 25% mortality rate. Patients with increased sputum production and higher supplemental oxygen requirements at admission, and insulin dependent diabetes or chronic kidney disease may be at increased risk for severe illness. A model for predicting intensive care unit admission or death with excellent discrimination was created that may aid in treatment decisions and resource allocation.

UK anxiety is high with lockdowns preventing a normal way of life for over a year. A lack of ability to travel freely causes numerous declines in quality of life including social isolation and poor physical and mental health. People need crowding information to choose safer travel options and subdue coronavirus. To provide effective guidance, it is essential to empirically formulate messaging to create clarity and trust which can be acted upon in confidence. Behaviour Change Techniques incorporating the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B model have been utilised in vast areas of public health intervention development and messaging. There is consensus that public transport information needs to be clearer and more accessible but BCTs have not been utilised in the development of public transport advice. This paper outlines the development of crowding messaging for public transport on a platform available to UK travellers. Barriers and facilitators were explored; related behaviours, intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were mapped. Specific message phrasing was developed utilising the mapped functions and advice from the literature. With the COVID-19 outbreak, having accessible and effective messaging for safely using public transport is a continuation of the work recently conducted examining the best ways to present public health information.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R(t)) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20C23, Feb 11C14, and March 10C13, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by R(t) has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34C53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated R(t) of 128 (95% CI 126C130) before the start of the school closures to 072 (070C074) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24C43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an R(t) of 110 (106C112) before the start of the school closures to 073 (068C077) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 745%, 975%, and 988% reported wearing masks when going out, and 613%, 902%, and 851% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

However, its etiology remains unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the pathophysiology of various diseases. Few studies have reported the role of lncRNAs in KD inflammation;thus, we investigated the role of lncRNA in KD inflammation. Methods A total of 50 patients with KD (median age, 19 months;29 males and 21 females) were enrolled. We conducted cap analysis gene expression sequencing to determine differentially expressed genes in monocytes of the peripheral blood of the subjects. Results About 21 candidate lncRNA transcripts were identified. The analyses of transcriptome and gene ontology revealed that the immune system was involved in KD. Among these genes, G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) and its antisense lncRNA, HSD11B1-AS1, were upregulated during the acute phase of KD (P < 0.0001 and <0.0001, respectively). Moreover, G0S2 increased when lipopolysaccharides induced inflammation in THP-1 monocytes, and silencing of G0S2 suppressed the expression of HSD11B1-AS1 and tumor necrosis factor-. Conclusions This study uncovered the crucial role of lncRNAs in innate immunity in acute KD. LncRNA may be a novel target for the diagnosis of KD.

It is now striking young and midlife adults as well because of sedentary lifestyle and increased intake of unhealthy food (e.g., western diet). The lockdown measures and economic turndown associated with the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are likely to increase the prevalence of sarcopenia by promoting sedentarism and unhealthy patterns of eating. Sarcopenia has multiple detrimental effects including falls, hospitalization, disability, and institutionalization. Although a few pharmacological agents (e.g., bimagrumab, sarconeos, and exercise mimetics) are being explored in different stages of trials, not a single drug has been approved for sarcopenia treatment. Hence, research has focused on testing the effect of nutraceuticals, such as bee products, as safe treatments to prevent and/or treat sarcopenia. Royal jelly, propolis, and bee pollen are common bee products that are rich in highly potent antioxidants such as flavonoids, phenols, and amino acids. These products, in order, stimulate larval development into queen bees, promote defenses of the bee hive against microbial and environmental threats, and increase royal jelly production by nurse bees. Thanks to their versatile pharmacological activities (e.g., anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, etc.), these products have been used to treat multiple chronic conditions that predispose to muscle wasting such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorder, and cancer, to name a few. They were also used in some evolving studies to treat sarcopenia in laboratory animals and, to a limited degree, in humans. However, a collective understanding of the effect and mechanism of action of these products in skeletal muscle is not well-developed. Therefore, this review examines the literature for possible effects of royal jelly, bee pollen, and propolis on skeletal muscle in aged experimental models, muscle cell cultures, and humans. Collectively, data from reviewed studies denote varying levels of positive effects of bee products on muscle mass, strength, and function. The likely underlying mechanisms include amelioration of inflammation and oxidative damages, promotion of metabolic regulation, enhancement of satellite stem cell responsiveness, improvement of muscular blood supply, inhibition of catabolic genes, and promotion of peripheral neuronal regeneration. This review offers suggestions for other mechanisms to be explored and provides guidance for future trials investigating the effects of bee products among people with sarcopenia.","output":"Apitherapy for Age-Related Skeletal Muscle Dysfunction (Sarcopenia): A Review on the Effects of Royal Jelly, Propolis, and Bee Pollen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some social settings such as households and workplaces, have been identified as high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Identifying and quantifying the importance of these settings is critical for designing interventions. A tightly-knit religious community in the UK experienced a very large COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, reaching 64.3% seroprevalence within 10 months, and we surveyed this community both for serological status and individual-level attendance at particular settings. Using these data, and a network model of people and places represented as a stochastic graph rewriting system, we estimated the relative contribution of transmission in households, schools and religious institutions to the epidemic, and the relative risk of infection in each of these settings. All congregate settings were important for transmission, with some such as primary schools and places of worship having a higher share of transmission than others. We found that the model needed a higher general-community transmission rate for women (3.3-fold), and lower susceptibility to infection in children to recreate the observed serological data. The precise share of transmission in each place was related to assumptions about the internal structure of those places.

The aim was to quantify preoperative symptoms and assess their relevance in predicting postoperative clinical outcomes following totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS The CCS was modified for preoperative use (modified or MCCS) by omitting mesh sensation questioning. Data collection was prospective over a 16 months period. (M)CCS questionnaires were completed preoperatively and at 2 then 6 weeks post repair. Intraoperative findings were also recorded. One hundred and four consecutive patients consented for TEP repair were included using a fibrin glue mesh fixation technique. RESULTS All three questionnaires were completed by 88 patients (84.6 %). Preoperative MCCS scores did not differ with age, obesity, the presence of bilateral or recurrent inguinal herniae or hernia type. Higher MCCS grouping [OR 4.3 (95 % CI 1.5C12.6)] and the presence of bilateral herniae [OR 8.5 (1.2C61.8)] were predictors of persisting discomfort at 6 weeks, with lower scores on MCCS [OR 16.4 (3.9C67.6), obesity (OR 9.9 91.6C63.2)] and recurrent hernia repair [OR 11.4 (1.4C91.0)] predicting increased discomfort at 2 weeks versus preoperatively. MCCS scores were inversely correlated with the size of a direct defect (r ?0.42, p = 0.011) but did not differ with the intraoperative finding of an incidental femoral and/or obturator hernia. Female sex was strongly associated with recognition of a synchronous incidental hernia (5 vs 57 %, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Pre- and post-operative scoring of hernia specific symptoms should be considered as part of routine surgical practice, to counsel patients on their expectations of pain and discomfort post repair and to select those who might be more appropriate for a watchful waiting approach.

METHODS: A cross-sectional data review was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from April to May 2021. Routine health management information system database was reviewed from Addis Ababa Health Bureau for the period from July 2019 to March 2021 across all quarters. Proportion and mean with standard deviation were computed. T-test was used to assess statistically significant differences in services mean performance. RESULTS: Postnatal care visit, new contraceptives accepters, safe abortion care and number of under-5 years old children treated for pneumonia significantly decreased by 9.3% (p-value 0.04), 20.3% (p-value 0.004), 23.7% (p-value 0.01) and 77.2% (p-value < 0.001), respectively during the first 8 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous 8 months average performance. The trends in Antenatal care first visit, new contraceptive accepters, pentavalent-3 vaccination and under-five children treated for pneumonia began to decline in January to March 2020, a quarter when the COVID-19 pandemic began; with accelerated declines in April to June 2020 following national lockdown.

They are able to infect many host, such as mammals or birds. Whereas CoVs were identified 1930s, they became known again in 2003 as the agents of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The spike protein is thought to be essential in the process of CoVs entry, because it is associated with the binding to the receptor on the host cell. It is also involved in cell tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor recognition is the crucial step in the infection. CoVs are able to bind a variety of receptors, although the selection of receptor remains unclear. Coronaviruses were initially believed to enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane. Further studies demonstrated that many of them involve endocytosis through clathrin-dependent, caveolae-dependent, clathrin-independent, as well as caveolae-independent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge about coronaviruses, focussing especially on CoVs entry into the host cell. Advances in understanding coronaviruses replication strategy and the functioning of the replicative structures are also highlighted. The development of host-directed antiviral therapy seems to be a promising way to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses.

For studies, liver tissue from cattle or pigs is often used as a substitute material.

Sweet potatoes as a substitute for liver have the advantages of better handling, easy procurement and stable material properties over time for microwave ablation experiments. The dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of sweet potato are characterized for temperature variation with the help of high-temperature dielectric probe. Furthermore, a test setup is presented for microwave ablation experiments in which a bowtie slot antenna matched to sweet potato is placed on its surface to directly receive the microwave power from a self-developed microwave applicator inserted into a sweet potato 4 cm below the surface antenna. A high-power source was used to excite the microwave powers up to 80 W and a spectrum analyzer was used to measure the signal received by the surface antenna. The experiments were performed in an anechoic chamber for safety reasons. Power at 50 W and 80 W was stimulated for a maximum of 600 s at the 2.45 GHz ISM band in different sweet potato experiments. A correlation is found between the power received by the surface antenna and rise of temperature inside sweet potato; relative received power drops from 1 at 76 C to 0.6 at 88 C (max. temperature) represents a 40% relative change in a 50 W microwave ablation experiment. The received power envelope at the surface antenna is between 10 mW and 32 mW during 50 W microwave ablation. Other important results for 10 min, 80 W microwave ablation include: a maximum ablation zone short axis diameter of 4.5 cm and a maximum ablation temperature reached at 99 C, 3 mm away from the applicator's slot. The results are compared with the state of the art in microwave ablation in animal liver. The dielectric constant and electrical conductivity evolution of sweet potato with rising temperature is comparable to animal liver in 50-60 C range. The reflection loss of self-developed applicator in sweet potato is below 15 dB which is equal to reflection loss in liver experiments for 600 s. The temperature rise for the first 90 s in sweet potato is 76 C as compared to 73 C in liver with 50 W microwave ablation. Similarly, with 80-75 W microwave ablation, for the first 60 s, the temperature is 98 C in sweet potato as compared to 100 C in liver.

Thirty-three percent created ventilator allocation protocols. Most hospitals (83%) designated more beds to the ICU; 50% of hospitals designated an ICU for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were isolated in negative pressure rooms at all hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Level I trauma centers created processes to provide optimal trauma patient care and still protect providers.

''Stay at home'' advice and the risk of coronavirus infection makes the patient afraid to approach hospital emergency department. Here is presented a rare complication related to gallbladder perforation with fistula to abdominal wall. A consequence of a subacute cholecystitis which the pacient did not came earlier to hospital because of the risk of virus infection. Methods: A 64-year-old woman developed an asymptomatic abdominal tumour located in the right hypochondrium, measuring 20 centimetres, which had been present for 3 weeks. A CT scan was performed showing an intermuscular cystic tumour in abdominal wall and hepatic subcapsular region. They were identified a perforation of the gallbladder fundus with a fistulous trajectory towards the abdominal wall and a dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile duct, secondary to extrinsic compression. [Formula presented] Subsequently, percutaneous drainage of the collection was performed. Followed by scheduled cholecystectomy, which revealed a perforated and inflammated gallbladder and a large cavity with a pyogenic capsule. The anatomical pathology of the specimen was described as chronic cholecystitis. The patient evolved satisfactorily after operation and was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. Results: After the start of quarantine, there has been a decrease in the number of visits to the emergency department. Acute pathologies such as cholecystitis present at diagnosis with more advanced and severe degrees of evolution compared to those diagnosed before the pandemic. Gallbladder perforation occurs in 12% of acute cholecystitis, with a mortality rate of 16%. In our case, according to Neimeier's classification, it is a subacute perforation type II (frequency 45.9%) with a pericholecystic collection and fistulization towards the abdominal wall, an unusual presentation. Conclusion: The new global epidemiological situation causes fear of infectious-contagious state to prevail over the appearance of new symptoms. This favours a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic pathologies, which then manifest in the patient in more advanced stages and require more complex treatments.","output":"Complication in Time of COVID-19: Biloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with an estimated increased risk of 50-60% compared to the general population. Lipid-lowering strategies have been shown to lower CVD risk significantly in people with RA and hyperlipidemia. Thus, CVD risk assessment has an important role to play in reducing CVD among people with RA. Yet currently only 37 to 45% of this population are receiving primary lipids screening. This paper describes the CArdiovascular Risk assEssment for RA (CARE RA) intervention, which is designed to address this issue. CARE RA is a peer coach intervention, that is, an intervention in which a person with RA coaches another person with RA, which is designed to educate people with RA about the relation between RA and CVD risk and to help them obtain evidence-based CVD risk assessment and treatment. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot study that will test if the participants assigned to complete the CARE RA curriculum with a peer coach will receive a cardiovascular risk assessment more frequently compared to those that complete the CARE RA curriculum by themselves. The CARE RA intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory. Participants in the peer coach intervention arm will receive the assistance of a peer coach who will call the participants once a week for 5 weeks to go over the CARE RA curriculum and train them on how to obtain CVD risk assessment. The control arm will complete the CARE RA curriculum without any assistance. Participants will be randomized 1:1 either to the control arm or to the peer coach intervention arm. The primary outcome is a participant's having a CVD risk assessment or initiating a statin, if indicated. Secondary outcomes include patient activation and RA medication adherence. The RE-AIM implementation framework guides the implementation and evaluation of the intervention. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will test the feasibility of the peer coach intervention in anticipation of a larger trial. CARE RA pioneers the use of peer coaches to facilitate the implementation of evidence-based treatment guidelines among people with RA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04488497 .

Over a longer duration of stroking, affective habituation sets in, indicated by a reduction in rated pleasantness. However, it is not clear whether the group level effect is represented on an individual level. We analyze the stability of individual ratings of slow stroking touch and their relationship to behavioural and physiological measures. 48 participants (23 women) were repeatedly stroked with a velocity maximally activating C-tactile fibres. The perceived pleasantness was rated on a visual analogue scale. In order to examine the stability of pleasantness ratings, the experiment was repeated after a couple of days. During the experiment, electrocardiogram (ECG) and facial- electromyography (EMG) data were recorded. On the group-level, previous results of affective habituation to touch were replicated and stable across sessions. On the individual level, however, less than half of the participants showed a significant reduction of pleasantness in the course of the experiment. Moreover, the remaining participants showed either no change, random rating behaviour or even an increase in pleasantness ratings during the course of the experiment. The individual response patterns were variable across sessions but stable above the chance level. Furthermore, the response patterns could not be explicitly associated with any of the behavioural or physiological measures. Our findings indicate a lack of group-to-individual generalizability for affective habituation to touch. The variability of rating patterns over time indicates that they are not conclusively determined by stable individual characteristics.

Methods: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to March 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios representing the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. Findings: In the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between Dec 2019 and early Jan 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 2 - 8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, simulated case counts were likely in the hundreds. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities.

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck and many schools shifted from in person to online teaching, we hypothesized that if safety measures were used, in person cadaveric anatomy could be safely taught without a decrease in student performance. To test this, we reduced onsite attendance to less than 25% of room capacity. Masks were required at all times and students were instructed to social distance. Six students were assigned per cadaver, but only two students dissected at a time. The other four students reviewed and completed dissections and/or reviewed in groups of two at other allotted times. Thus, students dissected only every third lab. Dissection and lab review attendance was mandatory and students were nearly 100% compliant. Teaching assistants recorded dissected prosections reviews, and these videos were uploaded to password protected course files for independent learning. Students were provided iPads in the laboratory and access to three software packages for use on and off site. All students had access to multiple formative quizzes and exams, and three new online practice practical exams were created. To help reduce testing anxiety, a pass/fail system replaced categorical grading. However, all written and practical exams were conducted on site and in person. At TTUHSC, we have developed an exam question database to track historical student performance including a 25-question optional pre-block practice exam used to assess incoming student anatomical aptitude. In 2020, 90% of incoming students (93% in 2019) took the pre-block exam and scored an average of 28% (24% in 2019). In 2020, despite vastly different content delivery approaches (&gt;80% of lectures were on Zoom) and reduced in-person dissection requirements, students modestly outperformed their 2019 counterparts. Overall exam averages were 89% in 2020 compared to 87% in 2019. If a categorical system was in place, 66% of students would have earned Honors or High Pass in 2020 compared to 61% in 2019. Our formative assessments were highly predictive of summative exam performance, and students reported that they reduced exam stress. Furthermore, summative exam averages correlated strongly with NBME performance (p&lt;0.0001, r2=0.63).

We conclude that 1) When using appropriate precautions, in person cadaveric anatomy can be taught safely during a pandemic;2) cadaveric dissection is essential for mastery of anatomical concepts;and 3) coupling online learning modalities with rigorous formative assessments prevented a modest reduction in cadaveric dissection opportunities from negatively impacting student performance.","output":"Lessons Learned from Teaching in Person Cadaveric Anatomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is typically presented with acute symptoms affecting upper and lower respiratory systems.

However, undergoing any systematic comparative analysis of the trends can be challenging given the quantity of data that must be presented. METHODS: We use the GBD data to describe trends in cause-specific DALY rates for eight regions. We quantify the extent to which the importance of major DALY causes changes relative to minor DALY causes over time by decomposing changes in the Gini coefficient into proportionality and reranking indices. RESULTS: The fall in regional DALY rates since 1990 has been accompanied by generally positive proportionality indices and reranking indices of negligible magnitude. However, the rate at which DALY rates have been falling has slowed and, at the same time, proportionality indices have tended towards zero. These findings are clearest where the focus is exclusively upon non-communicable diseases. Notably, large and positive proportionality indices are recorded for sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade. CONCLUSION: The positive proportionality indices show that disease burden has become less concentrated around the leading causes over time, and this trend has become less prominent as the DALY rate decline has slowed. The recent decline in disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionally driven by improvements in DALY rates for HIV/AIDS, as well as for malaria, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections.","output":"The relative importance and stability of disease burden causes over time: summarizing regional trends on disease burden for 290 causes over 28 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in early December 2019 in China and became a pandemic situation worldwide by its rapid spread to more than 200 countries or territories.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortality, unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is, to date, no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates. Rapid diagnostics have been developed, and significant efforts are being made to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the absence of any virus-specific therapy, internationally, health care authorities are recommending the adoption of effective community mitigation measures to counter and contain this pandemic virus. This paper is an overview of this virus and the disease with a particular focus on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 clinical pathology, pathogenesis, and immunopathology, along with recent research developments.","output":"An update on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 with particular reference to its clinical pathology, pathogenesis, immunopathology and mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) represent the largest family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).

Methods We present single-center data of 1,516 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI, USA) between March 13, 2020 and June 11, 2020. Results During the study period, 53 bronchoscopy procedures were performed at the institution, of which five patients tested positive for COVID-19. Of the five patients, three underwent BAL testing based on high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 after the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab(s) was negative. All three patients had underlying cancers and had lymphopenia for a considerable duration prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two patients had better outcomes that could be attributed to earlier BAL specimen testing resulting in timely medical intervention. Conclusion This study underscores the need for early lower respiratory tract sampling, whenever possible, in patients with cancer and prolonged lymphopenia. High clinical suspicion ought to supersede false-negative NP reverse transcriptaseCPCR as early bronchoscopic evaluation in cancer patients, who are either receiving active treatment or are immunosuppressed, can allow timely institution of efficacious treatment, enrollment into clinical trials, as well as effective infection control.

Constituting important correlates of protection, the determination of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is indispensable for convalescent plasma selection, vaccine candidate evaluation, and immunity certificates. In contrast to standard serological ELISAs, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to specialized laboratories. To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. After optimization of various parameters such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses, and duration of infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells became amenable as direct antigen source for quantitative icELISA. Antiviral agents such as human sera containing NAbs or antiviral interferons dose dependently reduced the SARS-CoV-2-specific signal. Applying increased infectious doses, the icELISA-based neutralization test (icNT) was superior to PRNT in discriminating convalescent sera with high from those with intermediate neutralizing capacities. In addition, the icNT was found to be specific, discriminating between SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and those raised against other coronaviruses. Altogether, the SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48 h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs and antiviral drugs using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments.","output":"A Novel In-Cell ELISA Assay Allows Rapid and Automated Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 to Analyze Neutralizing Antibodies and Antiviral Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a re-conceptualization of human security by exploring humanitarian discourse in the EU periphery.

METHODS Men with localized high-grade PCa (n=256, Gleason 8-10, International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grades 4 or 5) were imaged with bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDGPET/CT. We compared on a per-patient basis the accuracy of the two imaging modalities, taking intermodality agreement as the standard of truth (SOT). RESULTS 18F-FDG-PET/CT detected at least one bone metastasis in 33 patients compared to only 26 with bone scan. Of the seven false-negative bone scintigraphies, four (57.1%) were solitary metastases (monometastatic), three (42.9%) were oligometastatic (2-4 lesions), and none were plurimetastatic (>4 lesions). Compared to SOT, 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed higher sensitivity and accuracy than bone scintigraphy (100% vs. 78.8%, and 98.7% vs. 98.2%) for the detection of skeletal lesions. CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG-PET/CT appears similar or better than conventional bone scans to assess for bone metastases in patients newly diagnosed with high-grade PCa. Since intraprostatic FDG-uptake is also a biomarker of failure to radical prostatectomy and that FDG-PET/CT has been shown to be accurate in detecting PCa lymph node metastasis, FDG-PET/CT has the potential to be used as the sole preoperative staging modality in high-grade PCa.","output":"18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is accurate for high-grade prostate cancer bone staging when compared to bone scintigraphy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The current program-centric algorithm for the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) primarily uses the programs ranking of students to determine a match. Concerns that the existing algorithm favors programs over students, recent findings that the programs ranking of applicants is not associated with resident performance, and disruptions of existing screening methods and metrics have prompted reevaluation of the current algorithm relative to a student-centric algorithm, in which student ranking of programs is primary and program ranking of students is secondary. OBJECTIVE: To compare program-centric and student-centric algorithms for the NRMP participants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used randomized computer-generated data reflecting the NRMP match for 2018, 2019, and 2020, capturing more than 50 000 students and more than 4000 programs in 23 specialties, to compare the 2 algorithms. EXPOSURES: The same simulated students, programs, and rankings were exposed to the 2 algorithms, running 2300 simulations in the overall analysis and 1000 simulations in each of 23 specialties. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage of students who did and did not match, the percentage of students who matched to their top-ranked and top-5Cranked programs, and the programs rank of the last student matched per position were examined. RESULTS: The 2 algorithms were not different in percentage of students matched overall (eg, for 2020, program-centric: 59% [95% CI, 57%-61%]; student-centric: 58% [95% CI, 56%-60%]; P = .73). The student-centric algorithm, relative to the program-centric algorithm, matched a significantly higher percentage of students to their first-ranked program (eg, for 2020, 50% [95% CI, 48%-52%] vs 14% [95% CI, 13%-15%]; P < .001) and to their top-5Cranked programs (eg, for 2020, 60% [95% CI, 58%-62%] vs 46% [95% CI, 44%-48%]; P < .001). However, the last position was filled with students who had lower program rankings in the student-centric algorithm vs the program-centric algorithm (2 [95% CI, 1-2] vs 8 [95% CI, 6-10]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the 2 algorithms were not different in the percentage of students matched overall. However, the student-centric algorithm matched a significantly higher percentage of students to their preferred programs.

RESULTS Of the 313 included patients, 195 (62%) received IPC. Patients with IPC received neoadjuvant chemoradiation more often (45% vs. 3%, P < 0.001), whereas, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equally distributed (31% vs. 34%, P = 0.631). There were no differences with regard to surgical approach, operative time, blood loss, and ICU stay. Patients treated without IPC had a longer hospital stay (18 vs. 15 days, P = 0.014). Overall, 12 clinical VTE's occurred in 11 patients, which consisted of two deep venous thromboses and 10 pulmonary embolisms. In the group of patients, who received IPC 1.5% developed a symptomatic VTE compared to 6.8% in patients without IPC (OR = 0.215; 95% CI = 0.06-0.83). Multivariate analysis identified IPC as the only independent prognostic factor correlated with a reduction in postoperative VTE's (OR = 0.225; 95% CI = 0.06-0.88).

Epidemic spread is characterized by exponentially growing dynamics, which are intrinsically unpredictable. The time at which the growth in the number of infected individuals halts and starts decreasing cannot be calculated with certainty before the turning point is actually attained;neither can the end of the epidemic after the turning point. An SIR model with confinement (SCIR) illustrates how lockdown measures inhibit infection spread only above a threshold that we calculate. The existence of that threshold has major effects in predictability: A Bayesian fit to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that a slow-down in the number of newly infected individuals during the expansion phase allows to infer neither the precise position of the maximum nor whether the measures taken will bring the propagation to the inhibition regime. There is a short horizon for reliable prediction, followed by a dispersion of the possible trajectories that grows extremely fast. The impossibility to predict in the mid-term is not due to wrong or incomplete data, since it persists in error-free, synthetically produced data sets, and does not necessarily improve by using larger data sets.

METHODS: This paper presents analyses of data from a cross-sectional study. Adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the UK and self-isolating from others outside their own household were eligible to participate. Participants reported increase or no increase in their level of alcohol consumption from before to during lockdown, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between adults with and without reported increased alcohol consumption. The associations between reported increased alcohol consumption and mental health outcomes were investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: 691 adults (61.1 % women; 48.8 % aged 35?64 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 17 % reported increased alcohol consumption after lockdown. A higher proportion of 18?34-year olds reported increased alcohol consumption compared to older groups. The prevalence of poor overall mental health was significantly higher in individuals with increased alcohol consumption (vs. no increase) (45.4 % versus 32.7 %; p-value = 0.01). There was a significant association between increased alcohol consumption and poor overall mental health (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI = 1.01, 2.66), depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 2.93; 95 % CI = 0.91, 4.95) and mental wellbeing (unstandardized beta=-1.38; 95 % CI=-2.38, -0.39).

To support the ongoing novel vaccine design and development strategies, we report the structure-based design approach to develop self-derived S peptides. A dataset of crucial regions from the S protein were transformed into linear motifs that could act as the blockers or stabilizers for the S protein homotrimer unit. Among these distinct S peptides, the pep02 (537-QQFGRDIAD-545) and pep07 (821-RDLICAQKFNGLTVLPPLLTDE-842) were found making stable folded binding with the S protein (550C750 and 950C1050 regions). Upon inserting SARS-CoV-2 S variants in the peptide destabilized the complexed S protein structure, resulting an allosteric effect in different functional regions of the protein. Particularly, the molecular dynamics revealed that A544D mutation in the pep02 peptide induced instability for the complexed S protein, whereas the N943K variant from pep09 exhibited an opposite behavior. An increased protein-peptide binding affinity and the stable structural folding were observed in mutated systems, compared to that of the wild type systems. The presence of mutation has induced an up active conformation of the spike (RBD) domain, responsible for interacting the host cell receptor. Among the lower affinity peptide datasets (e.g., pep01), the S1 and S2 subunit in the protein formed an open conformation, whereas with higher affinity peptides (e.g., pep07) these domains gained a closed conformation.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to test the efficiency of PO(2)/FiO(2) and CAP severity scores in predicting mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission with influenza pneumonia patients. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with positive influenza virus RNA detection in Beijing Chao\\\\Yang Hospital during the 2009C2014 influenza seasons. Outpatients, inpatients with no pneumonia and incomplete data were excluded. We used receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) to verify the accuracy of severity scores or indices as mortality predictors in the study patients. RESULTS: Among 170 hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia, 30 (17.6%) died. Among those who were classified as low\\\\risk (predicted mortality 0.1%C2.1%) by pneumonia severity index (PSI) or confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age 65 year (CURB\\\\65), the actual mortality ranged from 5.9 to 22.1%. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that hypoxia (PO(2)/FiO(2)  250) and lymphopenia (peripheral blood lymphocyte count <0.8  10(9)/L) were independent risk factors for mortality, with OR value of 22.483 (95% confidence interval 4.927C102.598) and 5.853 (95% confidence interval 1.887C18.152), respectively. PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count performed well for mortality prediction with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945, which was significantly better than current CAP severity scores of PSI, CURB\\\\65 and confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age 65 years for mortality prediction (P < 0.001). The scores or indices for ICU admission prediction to hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia confirmed a similar pattern and PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count was also the best predictor for predicting ICU admission. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count is simple and reliable predictor of hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia in predicting mortality and ICU admission.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this streamlined, randomised, controlled, open-label trial, underway at 177 hospitals in the UK, two hospitals in Indonesia, and two hospitals in Nepal, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had no medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to participate in the trial. Eligible and consenting adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual standard of care plus colchicine (colchicine group) using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. Participants received colchicine 1 mg after randomisation followed by 500 g 12 h later and then 500 g twice a day by mouth or nasogastric tube for 10 days in total or until discharge. Dose frequency was halved for patients receiving a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, diltiazem), patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min per 173m(2), and those with an estimated bodyweight of less than 70 kg. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, secondary endpoints included time to discharge, the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days, and, in patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, a composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. All analyses were by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between Nov 27, 2020, and March 4, 2021, 11 340 (58%) of 19 423 patients enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were eligible to receive colchicine; 5610 (49%) patients were randomly assigned to the colchicine group and 5730 (51%) to the usual care group. Overall, 1173 (21%) patients in the colchicine group and 1190 (21%) patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 101 [95% CI 093 to 110]; p=077). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. Median time to discharge alive (10 days [IQR 5 to >28]) was the same in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (3901 [70%] patients in the colchicine group and 4032 [70%] usual care group; rate ratio 098 [95% CI 094 to 103]; p=044). In those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1344 [25%] in the colchicine group vs 1343 [25%] patients in the usual care group; risk ratio 102 [95% CI 096 to 109]; p=047).

AIM: Research has demonstrated increasing rates of birth trauma and birth plan alterations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study specifically examined these intersecting experiences to understand how COVID-related healthcare changes have impacted birth trauma during the pandemic. METHODS: 269 people who gave birth in the U.S. during COVID-19 completed an online survey between November, 2020-May, 2021 which included questions about COVID-related perinatal healthcare changes and birth-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; The City Birth Trauma Scale). T-tests were run on birth demographics to assess for significant indicators of PTSD; variables having significant effects were used to build a hierarchical regression model to predict PTSD symptoms. FINDINGS: 5.9% of the sample met criteria for PTSD and 72.3% met partial criteria. The overall regression model predicted approximately 19% of variance in total PTSD symptoms. Labor and birth demographics were entered in Step 1 and predicted approximately 11% of variance: limited length of stay for support person, being allowed 1 support person who had to be the same, and mask requirements were significant predictors of PTSD. Variables related to birth plan changes were entered in Step 2 and predicted approximately 8% of variance: changes to support person(s) for labor and birth, breastfeeding plans, and birth location were significant predictors of PTSD.

Recently, a terrestrial isopod species was found to be infected by an unusual strain of supergroup F Wolbachia. However, only Wolbachia of supergroup B is typically found in isopods. One possibility is that these isopods acquired the infection because of their recurrent contact with termitesa group with strong evidence of infection by supergroup F Wolbachia. Thus, our goals were: (1) check if the infection was an isolated case in isopods, or if it revealed a broader pattern; (2) search for Wolbachia infection in the termites within Brazil; and (3) look for evidence consistent with horizontal transmission between isopods and termites. We collected Neotroponiscus terrestrial isopods and termites along the Brazilian coastal Atlantic forest. We sequenced and identified the Wolbachia strains found in these groups using coxA, dnaA, and fpbA genes. We constructed phylogenies for both bacteria and host taxa and tested for coevolution. We found the supergroup F Wolbachia in other species and populations of Neotroponiscus, and also in Nasutitermes and Procornitermes termites. The phylogenies showed that, despite the phylogenetic distance between isopods and termites, the Wolbachia strains clustered together. Furthermore, cophylogenetic analyses showed significant jumps of Wolbachia between terrestrial isopods and termites. Thus, our study suggests that the horizontal transmission of supergroup F Wolbachia between termites and terrestrial isopods is likely.

Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission.

The complexity of the IRRPSP is caused by several sources. The problem combines the assignment of patients to recovery rooms and the scheduling of caregivers over a short-term planning horizon. Moreover, a solution of the IRRPSP should respect a set of hard and soft constraints while solving the main problem such as the maximum capacity of recovery rooms, the maximum daily load of caregivers, the treatment deadlines, etc. Thus, the need for an automated tool to support the decision-makers in handling the planning and scheduling tasks arises. In this paper, we present an exhaustive description of the epidemiological situation within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, especially in Jeddah Governorate. We will highlight the importance of implementing a formal and systematic approach in dealing with the scheduling of recovery rooms during extreme emergency periods like the COVID-19 era. To do so, we developed a mathematical programming model to present the IRRPSP in a formal way which will help in analyzing the problem and lately use its solution for comparison and evaluation of our proposed approach.

METHODS: Twenty-six patients (14 males, age 64  16 years) urgently hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, who underwent chest CT and bedside LUS on the day of admission, were enrolled in this observational study. CT images were reviewed by expert chest radiologists, who calculated a visual CT score based on extension and distribution of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. LUS was performed by clinicians with certified competency in thoracic ultrasonography, blind to CT findings, following a systematic approach recommended by ultrasound guidelines. LUS score was calculated according to presence, distribution, and severity of abnormalities. RESULTS: All participants had CT findings suggestive of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with an average visual scoring of 43  24%. LUS identified 4 different possible -abnormalities, with bilateral distribution (average LUS score 15  5): focal areas of nonconfluent B lines, diffuse confluent B lines, small subpleural microconsolidations with pleural line irregularities, and large parenchymal consolidations with air bronchograms.

METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31-September 15, 2020) targeting healthcare workers (HCW) who were clinically active during the pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and reported demographic/career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI>5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI>14. The mini-Z was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: Nine-hundred and sixty-three surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly white (92.8%), female (73.4%), aged 30-49 (71.9%), and physicians (64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 (SD 1.2) hours. Nearly 90% reported poor sleep (PSQI). One third (33.0%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many (60%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device usage or had bad dreams at least once per week (45%). Over 50% reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, non-physician (OR 2.4; CI: 1.7, 3.4), caring for COVID-19 patients (OR 1.8; CI 1.2, 2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2; CI: 1.4, 3.5), being female (OR 1.6; CI 1.1, 2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3; CI 2.7,6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia.

Meanwhile, the capacity of solid waste management facilities (SWMFs) for waste disposal does not meet the needs, resulting in adverse consequences on the natural environment and health of residents living near these plants, which can significantly degrade their quality of life (QoL). This study aims to evaluate the QoL of residents living near an SWMF and the potential impacts it has on the residents. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted involving 801 subjects, aged 18 and above, who live near the SWMF of Hue City, Vietnam. The QoL of the subjects was quantitatively assessed using the WHO QoL assessment scale (WHOQOL-BREF). The general, health, and environmental factors influencing QoL were identified using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: About 22.6% of the subjects had a good QoL. In particular, the proportions for good psychological health (6.9%) and environment (13.6%) were low, indicating an influence of the SWMF. Significant factors that degraded the QoL of residents were less education defined by not graduating from high school (odds ratio, OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.09-7.06), poor health status (OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.56-4.01), dissatisfaction with water quality (OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.10-5.25), and unacceptance of the SWMF presence (OR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.11-2.60). Moreover, subjects living within 2 km of the plant had dermatological diseases and digestive disorders more frequently than those who lived away from the plant. They also reported more complaints regarding water, air, and soil quality, which were likely due to the operation of the SWMF. Conclusions: Burying and disposing of solid waste at the SWMF might lead to the degradation of the surrounding water and soil environments, and its collection and transportation are considered to cause odor and dust. The efforts of responsible authorities to strictly supervise and inspect these activities at the SWMF are essential, not only to protect the surrounding environment but also to improve the QoL of those who live nearby these plants.","output":"Quality of Life and Factors Affecting It: A Study Among People Living Near a Solid Waste Management Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INDIA- As for reported in 360 COVID-19 cases (till March 22, 2020), seven people were died, and 23 people were treated successfully.(1) This virus can easily affect who having respiratory problem and especially who all have been aged older than sixty.

However, experience level and workload of technicians and radiologists may affect the decision process. Recent studies suggest that deep learning can be used to assess CXRs, providing an important second opinion for radiologists and technicians in the decision process, and super-human performance in detection of COVID-19 has been reported in multiple studies. In this study, the clinical applicability of deep learning systems for COVID-19 screening was assessed by testing the performance of deep learning systems for the detection of COVID-19. Specifically, four datasets were used: (1) a collection of multiple public datasets (284.793 CXRs); (2) BIMCV dataset (16.631 CXRs); (3) COVIDGR (852 CXRs) and 4) a private dataset (6.361 CXRs). All datasets were collected retrospectively and consist of only frontal CXR views. A ResNet-18 was trained on each of the datasets for the detection of COVID-19. It is shown that a high dataset bias was present, leading to high performance in intradataset train-test scenarios (area under the curve 0.55C0.84 on the collection of public datasets). Significantly lower performances were obtained in interdataset train-test scenarios however (area under the curve > 0.98). A subset of the data was then assessed by radiologists for comparison to the automatic systems. Finetuning with radiologist annotations significantly increased performance across datasets (area under the curve 0.61C0.88) and improved the attention on clinical findings in positive COVID-19 CXRs. Nevertheless, tests on CXRs from different hospital services indicate that the screening performance of CXR and automatic systems is limited (area under the curve < 0.6 on emergency service CXRs).

However, national polls conducted before vaccine distribution began suggested that many persons were hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination (2). To examine perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccine and intentions to be vaccinated, in September and December 2020, CDC conducted household panel surveys among a representative sample of U.S. adults. From September to December, vaccination intent (defined as being absolutely certain or very likely to be vaccinated) increased overall (from 39.4% to 49.1%); the largest increase occurred among adults aged 65 years.

However, the complex tumor microenvironment of cervical cancer and the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance are not well studied. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze cells from pretreated and chemoresistant cervical cancer tissues to generate a molecular census of cell populations. METHODS: Biopsy tissues collected from patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, and chronic cervicitis were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing using the 10 Genomics platform. Unsupervised clustering analysis of cells was performed to identify the main cell types, and important cell clusters were reclustered into subpopulations. Gene expression profiles and functional enrichment analysis were used to explore gene expression and functional differences between cell subpopulations in cervicitis and cervical cancer samples and between chemoresistant and chemosensitive samples. RESULTS: A total of 24,371 cells were clustered into nine separate cell types, including immune and non-immune cells. Differentially expressed genes between chemoresistant and chemosensitive patients enriched in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway were involved in tumor development, progression, and apoptosis, which might lead to chemotherapy resistance.

In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N = 164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals.

The mechanisms contributing to latency are diverse and depend on the nature of both the microbe and the host. Latency has advantages for both host and microbe. The host avoids progressive damage caused by interaction with the microbe that may translate into disease, and the microbe secures a stable niche in which to survive. Latency is clinically important because some latent microbes can be transmitted to other hosts, and it is associated with a risk for recrudescent microbial growth and development of disease. In addition, it can predispose the host to other diseases, such as malignancies. Hence, latency is a temporally unstable state with an eventual outcome that mainly depends on host immunity. Latency is an integral part of the pathogenic strategies of microbes that require human (and/or mammalian) hosts, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Toxoplasma gondii. However, latency is also an outcome of infection with environmental organisms such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which require no host in their replicative cycles.

While both constructed dimers retained the ability to bind gp120 and the viral surface, Grft-linker-Grft OneArm was 84- to 1,010-fold less able to inhibit HIV than wild-type Grft, while Grft-linker-Grft had near-wild-type antiviral potency. Furthermore, while the wild-type protein demonstrated the ability to alter the structure of gp120 by exposing the CD4 binding site, Grft-linker-Grft OneArm largely lost this ability. In experiments to investigate gp120 shedding, it was found that Grft has different effects on gp120 shedding for strains from subtype B and subtype C, and this might correlate with Grft function. Evidence is provided that the dimer form of Grft is critical to the function of this protein in HIV inhibition.","output":"The griffithsin dimer is required for high-potency inhibition of HIV-1: evidence for manipulation of the structure of gp120 as part of the griffithsin dimer mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui kebijakan hukum pidana yang menghambat penetapan status darurat kesehatan masyarakat pada saat diselenggarakan kekarantinaan kesehatan dan menganalisis sistem pemidanaan yang ideal untuk diterapkan bagi pelaku tindak pidana kekarantinaan kesehatan. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah penelitian hukum normatif melalui pendekatan perundang-undangan (statute approach). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa secara teoritis kebijakan hukum pidana dalam darurat kesehatan masyarakat sulit untuk diterapkan. Substansi Pasal 93 UU Kekarantinaan Kesehatan memuat 2 (dua) jenis delik yaitu delik formil dan delik materil. Namun, terdapat penggunaan kata yang masih di antaranya: perbuatan menghalang-halangi? serta menempatkan kedaruratan kesehatan sebagai sebab dalam peraturan tersebut merupakan sebuah kerancuan. Seharusnya rumusan kausalitas pidana dalam sebuah produk hukum pidana dirumuskan sesuai dengan konsepsi awalnya. Oleh karena itu, rumusan delik yang atau luas akan menghasilkan ketidakpastian hukum berpotensi tidak dapat diterapkan dan bertentangan dengan penafsiran yang menyatakan bahwa hukum pidana harus ditafsirkan secara sempit. Merujuk pada keadaan tersebut maka sistem pemidanaan yang ideal diterapkan ketika terjadi pelanggaran penyelenggaraan kekarantinaan kesehatan yaitu sistem pemidanaan yang bersifat restoratif dan integratif. Kata kunci: Pandemi COVID-19, Kekarantinaan Kesehatan, Kebijakan Hukum Pidana This study aims to determine the legal policy policies that apply Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine and analyze the ideal punishment system to be applied to health quarantine crimes. The research method used is normative research through an invited approach (statute approach). The results show that legal policies in public health emergencies are difficult to implement. The substance of Article 93 of the Health Quarantine Law contains 2 types of offenses namely formal offenses and material offenses. However, there is a use of the word which is still beside: the act of obstructing and placing a health emergency as cause in the regulation is a confusion. The formulation of criminal causality in a criminal law product should be formulated in accordance with its initial conception. Therefore, the or broad formulation of offenses will provide legal uncertainty which cannot be applied and contradicts the interpretation which states that criminal law must be interpreted narrowly. Referring to this situation the ideal punishment system is applied when implementing health quarantine namely a restorative and integrative system of punishment.

The activities of some of these factors are, in turn, blocked by viral countermeasures. The ensuing battle between the host and the viruses is crucial for determining whether the virus establishes a foothold and/or induces adaptive immune responses. A comprehensive systems-level understanding of the repertoire of anti-viral effectors in the context of these immediate virus-host responses would provide significant advantages in devising novel strategies to interfere with the initial establishment of infections. Recent efforts to identify cellular factors in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, using genome-wide siRNA screens and other systems biology omics methodologies, have revealed several potential anti-viral effectors for viruses like Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus (WNV), and influenza virus.

This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the actual vaulting after refractive EVO-ICL surgery. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who underwent EVO-ICL surgery at a tertiary eye hospital between October and December 2019. A RESCAN 700 was used for the intraoperative and CIRRUS HD-OCT was used for postoperative observation of vaulting. Subjective and objective refractions, anterior ocular segment, corneal morphology, intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber volume (ACV), crystalline lens rise (CLR), white-to-white distance (WTW), anterior chamber depth (ACD), axial length, corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), and fundoscopy were examined. A multivariable analysis was performed to determine the factors independently associated with 1-month postoperative vaulting. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (102 eyes) were included. Compared with the eyes with normal vaulting, those with high vaulting had higher preoperative diopter values (P = 0.039), lower preoperative corrected visual acuity (P = 0.006), lower preoperative IOP (P = 0.029), higher preoperative ACD (P = 0.004), lower preoperative CLR (P = 0.046), higher ICL spherical equivalent (P = 0.030), higher intraoperative vaulting (P < 0.001), and lower IOP at 1 month (P = 0.045). The multivariable analysis showed that the only factor independently associated with high vaulting at 1 month after surgery was the intraoperative vaulting value (odds ratio = 1.005, 95% confidence interval: 1.002C1.007, P < 0.001). The intraoperative and 1-month postoperative vaulting values were positively correlated (R(2) = 0.562).

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) have confirmed efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are now being considered as an alternative add-on therapy for people with uncontrolled asthma. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of adding a LAMA to ICS compared with adding a LABA for adults whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS alone. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR) from inception to April 2015, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. We searched additional resources to pick up unpublished studies, including ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization trials portal, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries. The most recent search was conducted in April 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for parallel and cross-over RCTs in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled with ICS alone were randomised to receive LAMA add-on or LABA add-on for at least 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the electronic and additional searches and extracted data from study reports. We used Covidence for duplicate screening, extraction of study characteristics and numerical data, and risk of bias ratings.The pre-specified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), quality of life and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We included eight studies meeting the inclusion criteria, but four double-blind, double-dummy studies of around 2000 people dominated the analyses. These four trials were between 14 and 24 weeks long, all comparing tiotropium (usually Respimat) with salmeterol on top of medium doses of ICS.Studies reporting exacerbations requiring OCS showed no difference between the two add-ons, but our confidence in the effect was low due to inconsistency between studies and because the confidence intervals (CI) included significant benefit of either treatment (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.18; 1753 participants; 3 studies); three more people per 1000 might have an exacerbation on LAMA, but the CIs ranged from 29 fewer to 61 more. Imprecision was also an issue for serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission, rated low (serious adverse events) and very low quality (exacerbations requiring hospital admission), because there were so few events in the analyses.People taking LAMA scored slightly worse on two scales measuring quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; AQLQ) and asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire; ACQ); the evidence was rated high quality but the effects were small and unlikely to be clinically significant (AQLQ: mean difference (MD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.05; 1745 participants; 1745; 4 studies; ACQ: MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.13; 1483 participants; 3 studies).There was some evidence to support small benefits of LAMA over LABA on lung function, including on our pre-specified preferred measure trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (MD 0.05 L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09; 1745 participants, 4 studies). However, the effects on other measures varied, and it is not clear whether the magnitude of the differences were clinically significant.More people had adverse events on LAMA but the difference with LABA was not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Direct evidence of LAMA versus LABA as add-on therapy is currently limited to studies of less than six months comparing tiotropium (Respimat) to salmeterol, and we do not know how they compare in terms of exacerbations and serious adverse events. There was moderate quality evidence that LAMAs show small benefits over LABA on some measures of lung function, and high quality evidence that LABAs are slightly better for quality of life, but the differences were all small. Given the much larger evidence base for LABA versus placebo for people whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS, the current evidence is not strong enough to say that LAMA can be substituted for LABA as add-on therapy.The results of this review, alongside pending results from related reviews assessing the use of LAMA in other clinical scenarios, will help to define the role of these drugs in asthma and it is important that they be updated as results from ongoing and planned trials emerge.","output":"Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) versus addition of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for adults with asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on a collection of auto\\\\ethnographic narratives that reflect our experiences as academic mothers at an Australian university, this paper seeks to illustrate the impact of COVID\\\\19 on our career cycles in order to explore alternative feminist models of progression and practice in Higher Education.

It provides scholars with a roadmap for understanding where the field has been and where it might go in the future. In particular, this analysis details the venues in which knowledge syntheses are published, the types of syntheses conducted, citation rates they produce, and altmetric attention they garner. Method In 2020, the authors conducted a bibliometric analysis of knowledge syntheses published in 14 core medical education journals from 1999 to 2019. To characterize the studies, metadata was extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science, Altmetrics Explorer, and Unpaywall. Results The authors analyzed 963 knowledge syntheses representing 3.1% of total articles published (n=30,597). On average, 45.9 knowledge syntheses were published annually (SD=35.85, Median=33), and there was an overall 2,620% increase in the number of knowledge syntheses published from 1999 to 2019. The journals each published, on average, a total of 68.8 knowledge syntheses (SD=67.2, Median=41) with Medical Education publishing the most (n=189; 19%). Twenty-one knowledge synthesis types were identified; the most prevalent types were systematic reviews (n=341; 35.4%) and scoping reviews (n=88; 9.1%).

Little is known about the effectiveness of these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the highly-prevalent B.1.427/B.1.429 variant in California.. METHODS: In this quality improvement project, we collected demographic and clinical information from post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases (PVSCs), defined as health care personnel (HCP) with positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT after receiving 1 vaccine dose. Available specimens were tested for L452R, N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR. Mutation prevalence was compared among unvaccinated, early post-vaccinated (<=14 days after dose 1), partially vaccinated (positive test >14 days after dose 1 and 14 days after dose 2) and fully vaccinated (>14 days after dose 2) PVSCs. RESULTS: From December 2020-April 2021, >=23,090 HCPS received at least1 dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 660 HCP cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred of which 189 were PVSCs. Among the PVSCs, 114 (60.3%), 49 (25.9%) and 26 (13.8%) were early post-vaccination, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively. Of 261 available samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated HCP, 103 (39.5%), including 42 PVSCs (36.5%), had L452R mutation presumed to be B.1.427/B.1.429,. When adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427/B.1.429, PVSCs did not have significantly elevated risk for infection with B.1.427/B.1.429 compared with unvaccinated HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Most PVSCs occurred prior to expected onset of full, vaccine-derived immunity. Presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429 was not more prevalent in post-vaccine cases than in unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 HCP. Continued infection control measures, particularly 14 days post-vaccination, and continued variant surveillance in PVSCs is imperative to control future SARS-CoV-2 surges.","output":"Post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections and incidence of presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429 variant among healthcare personnel at a northern California academic medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing importance of information and communication technologies in access to basic services like education and health, the question of the digital divide based on caste assumes importance in India where large socioeconomic disparities persist between different caste groups. Studies on caste-based digital inequality are still scanty in India. Using nationally representative survey data, this paper analyzes the first-level digital divide (ownership of computer and access to the internet) and the second-level digital divide (individual's skill to use computer and the internet) between the disadvantaged caste group and the others. Further, this paper identifies the caste group-based differences in socioeconomic factors that contribute to the digital divide between these groups using a non-linear decomposition method. The results show that there exists a large first-level and second-level digital divide between the disadvantaged caste groups and others in India. The non-linear decomposition results indicate that the caste-based digital divide in India is rooted in historical socioeconomic deprivation of disadvantaged caste groups. More than half of the caste-based digital gap is attributable to differences in educational attainment and income between the disadvantaged caste groups and others.

Nepal has been severely affected by it, with an increasing number of confirmed cases and casualties in recent days, even after 8 months of the first case detected in China. As of 26 November 2020, there were over 227,600 confirmed cases of COVID in Nepal with 209,435 recovered cases and 1,412 deaths. This study aimed to compile public data available from the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Government of Nepal (GoN) and analyse the data of 104 deceased COVID-19 patients using IBM SPSS (Version 25.0). Additionally, this study also aimed to provide critical insights on response of the GoN to COVID-19 and way forward to confront unprecedented pandemic. Figures and maps were created using the Origin Lab (Version 2018) and QGIS (Version 3.10.8). Most of the reported cases were from Bagmati Province, the location of Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu. Among deceased cases, >69% of the patients were male and patients &#8805;54 years accounted for 67.9% (n = 923). Preliminary findings showed respiratory illness, diabetes, and chronic kidney diseases were the most common comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths in Nepal. Despite some efforts in the 8 months since the first case was detected, the government's response so far has been insufficient. Since the government eased the lockdown in July 2020, Nepal is facing a flood of COVID-19 cases. If no aggressive actions are taken, the epidemic is likely to result in significant morbidity and mortality in Nepal. The best way to curb the effect of the ongoing pandemic in a resource-limited country like Nepal is to increase testing, tracing, and isolation capacity, and to set up quality quarantine centers throughout the nation. A comprehensive health literacy campaign, quality care of older adults and those with comorbidity will also result in the effective management of the ongoing pandemic.","output":"How Well the Government of Nepal Is Responding to COVID-19?

Bacterial and viral infections might influence the patients' prognosis, both directly affecting the immune system and indirectly impairing the outcome of anticancer treatments, mainly immunotherapy. In this analysis, we aimed to review the current evidence in order to clarify the complex correlation between infections and lung cancer. In detail, we mainly explored the potential impact on immunotherapy outcome/safety of (1) bacterial infections, with a detailed focus on antibiotics; and (2) viral infections, discriminating among (a) human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), (b) hepatitis B/C virus (HBV-HCV), and (c) Sars-Cov-2. A series of studies suggested the prognostic impact of antibiotic therapy administration, timing, and exposure ratio in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, probably through an antibiotic-related microbiota dysbiosis. Although cancer patients with HIV, HBV, and HCV were usually excluded from clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy, some retrospective and prospective trials performed in these patient subgroups reported similar results compared to those described in not-infected patients, with a favorable safety profile. Moreover, patients with thoracic cancers are particularly at risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality. Few reports speculated about the prognostic implications of anticancer therapy, including immunotherapy, in lung cancer patients with concomitant Sars-Cov-2 infection, showing, to date, inconsistent results. The correlation between infectious diseases and immunotherapy remains to be further explored and clarified in the context of dedicated trials.

Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. Methods All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the ROs shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. Results Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and ROs shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. Conclusions Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","output":"Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to 2019-nCoV infection, emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China and even worldwide. Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.","output":"Utilizing integrating network pharmacological approaches to investigate the potential mechanism of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction in treating COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases.

The United Kingdom experienced its first wave of CoronavirusC19 (Covid-19) disease in Spring 2020. Critical care units had to make major changes to their working practices in a short space of time and faced multiple challenges in doing so, including the challenge of caring for patients in multiple organ failure secondary to Covid-19 infection in the absence of an established evidence base of best practice. We undertook a qualitative investigation of the personal and professional challenges faced by critical care consultants in one Scottish health board in acquiring and evaluating information to guide clinical decision making during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: Critical care consultants in NHS Lothian working in critical care from March to May 2020 were eligible to participate in the study. Participants were invited to take part in a one-to-one semi structured interview conducted using Microsoft Teams videoconferencing software. Reflexive thematic analysis was used as the method for data analysis using qualitative research methodology informed by a subtle realist position. RESULTS: Analysis of the interview data generated the following themes: The Knowledge Gap; Trust in Information; and Implications for Practice. Illustrative quotes are presented in the text and thematic tables. DISCUSSION: This study explored the experiences of critical care consultant physicians in acquiring and evaluating information to guide clinical decision making during the first wave of the SARS CoV2 pandemic. This study revealed that clinicians were profoundly affected by the pandemic and the ways in which it changed how they could access information to guide clinical decision making. The paucity of reliable information on SARS-CoV-2 posed a significant threat to the clinical confidence of participants. Two strategies were adopted to ease mounting pressures C an organised approach to data collection and the establishment of a local community of collaborative decision-making. These findings contribute to the wider literature by describing health care professionals experiences in unprecedented times and could inform recommendations for future clinical practice. This could include governance around responsible information sharing in professional instant messaging groups, and medical journal guidelines on suspension of usual peer review and other quality assurance processes during pandemics.","output":"Intensive care clincians information acquisition during the first wave of the Covid 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced schools worldwide to suddenly transition to remote learning.

However, transcriptional programming of decidual MAIT cells in pregnancy remains poorly understood. METHOD OF STUDY We employed a multiomic approach to address this question. Mononuclear cells from the decidua basalis and parietalis, and control PBMCs, were analyzed via flow cytometry to investigate MAIT cells in the decidua and assess their transcription factor expression. In a separate study, both decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells were analyzed using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) coupled with gene expression analysis. Lastly, decidual MAIT cells were stimulated with E.coli and expression of MR1 by antigen presenting cells was measured to evaluate decidual MAIT cell function. RESULTS First, we identified MAIT cells in both the decidua basalis and parietalis. CITE-seq, coupled with scRNA-seq gene expression analysis, highlighted transcriptional programming differences between decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells at a single cell resolution. Transcription factor expression analysis further highlighted transcriptional differences between decidual MAIT cells and non-matched peripheral MAIT cells. Functionally, MAIT cells are skewed towards IFN and TNF production upon stimulation, with E.coli leading to IFN production. Lastly, we demonstrate that MR1, the antigen presenting molecule restricting MAIT cells, is expressed by decidual APCs. CONCLUSION MAIT cells are present in the decidua basalis and obtain a unique gene expression profile. The presence of MR1 on APCs coupled with in vitro activation by E.coli suggests that MAIT cells might be involved in tissue-repair mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface.

Community detection focuses on identifying the sub-graphs (communities) which have dense connections within it as compared to outside of it, whereas centrality analysis focuses on identifying significant nodes in a social network based on different aspects of importance. A number of research works have focused on identifying community structure in large-scale network. However, very less effort has been emphasized on quantifying the influence of the communities. In this paper, group of nodes that are likely to form communities are first uncovered and then they are quantified based on the influencing ability in the network. Identifying exact boundaries of communities are quite challenging in large scale network. The major contribution in this paper is to develop a model termed as FRC-FGSN (Fuzzy Rough Communities in Fuzzy Granular Social Network), to identify the communities with the help of fuzzy and rough set theory. The proposed model is based on a idea that, the degree of belongingness a node in a community may not be binary but can be models through fuzzy membership. The second contribution is to quantifying the influence of the community using eigenvector centrality. In order to improve the scalability, several steps in the proposed model have been implemented using map-reduce programming paradigm in a cluster-computing framework like Hadoop.

The effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity has been little studied. In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients and the effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients were contacted by phone and those who approved to participate in the study were questionned about their sociodemographic characteristics, body-mass index, smoking history, and about their atopic status. Rate of atopic diseases among mild and severe COVID-19 patients and risk estimates for mild disease in atopic and non-atopic COVID-19 patients were calculated. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 235 adults with COVID-19 (mean age, 45.3 years [standard deviation, 15.0 years]; 139 (59.1%) male). Among study population 16 (6.8%) subjects had one of the three atopic symptoms which were wheezing, rhinitis or eczema. Among the subjects with atopic status 4 (1.7%) subjects had wheezing, 8 (3.4%) had rhinitis and 4 (1.7%) had eczema within the last 12 months. Although atopic status is associated with 3.1 times higher odds for mild disease, being atopic or not being atopic was not found to be associated with COVID-19 severity (p=.054).

There is concern severe OSAS increases risk of comorbid cardiopulmonary abnormalities, such as ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary hypertension, which preoperative testing could detect. Our objective is to determine if there is a severity of pediatric OSAS where previously undetected cardiopulmonary comorbidities are likely. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 358 patients 21 years with severe OSAS who underwent adenotonsillectomy at a tertiary hospital June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2018. We extracted demographics, comorbidities, polysomnography, and preoperative tests. Wilcoxon rank-sum and logistic regression estimated associations of OSAS severity (based on obstructive apnea-hypopnea index [OAHI], hypoxia, hypercarbia) with preoperative echocardiograms and chest X-rays (CXRs). RESULTS Mean age was 5.9 (3.6) years and 52% were male. Mean OAHI and oxygen saturation nadir were 30.3 (23.8) and 80.7% (9.2), respectively. OAHI 60 was associated with having a preoperative echocardiogram (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.5) or CXR (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.8) compared to OAHI 10-59. There were no significant associations between OSAS severity and test abnormalities. The presence of previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary comorbidities was associated with abnormalities on echocardiogram (OR, 36; 95% CI, 4.1-320.1) and CXR (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.2-14.4). CONCLUSIONS Although pediatric patients with very severe OSAS (OAHI 60) underwent more pre-adenotonsillectomy cardiopulmonary tests, OSAS severity did not predict abnormal findings. Known cardiopulmonary comorbidities may be a better indication for cardiopulmonary testing than polysomnographic parameters, which could streamline pre-adenotonsillectomy evaluation and reduce cost.

STUDY DESIGN Controlled randomized experimental study. ANIMALS Adult Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred horses (n = 5). METHODS One 6.25 cm(2) wound was created on the dorsomedial aspect of the proximal metacarpus on each forelimb. A SPF dressing was applied to 1 randomly assigned limb as a treatment and a non-adherent, absorbent dressing was applied to the opposite limb as control. Bandages were changed every 3 days for 60 days. Granulation tissue was scored every 3 days, wound area measured every 6 days, and wound bed was cultured every 12 days. RESULTS SPF-treatment wounds had significantly decreased wound area and decreased granulation tissue scores when evaluated <30 days and over the 60 day study, although complete wound healing times were not significantly different. Bacteria were cultured from all wounds at varying times throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS The SPF wound dressing improved some measures of wound healing compared with the control dressing, most significantly during the first 30 days.

We introduce a new procedure to define the suture points in Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After dissection of the hiatus and mobilization of the fundus, the circumference of the esophagus c is measured at a point 2-cm cranial from the esophagogastric junction over the 52-Fr bougie. The inner diameter of the fundoplication is calculated based on the esophageal diameter. To create a 2-cm fundoplication in which the greater curvature of the gastric fundus is moved straight toward the cranial side without any twist, we located points a and b, which correspond to the top of the left and right suture positions on fundoplication, respectively. Approximately 2 cm of floppy Nissen is constructed by suturing caudally with intervals of ~1 cm. METHODS A total of 20 patients (3 men, 17 women, mean age, 64.5 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or hiatal hernia underwent LNF using this procedure. RESULTS LNF was successful in all 20 patients. There were no complications except for mild dysphagia in two patients, which disappeared within 3 weeks. Improvement of the symptom scores for heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia was observed in all patients. The evaluation of the fundoplication by the morphologic scores was quite satisfactory. During a median follow-up period of 30 months, 19 patients exhibited no recurrence, and 1 patient had a mild recurrence but was controlled by PPI on demand. CONCLUSIONS Our new procedure is very safe and effective to create a proper Nissen fundoplication.

They are active in the highly hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane, as opposed to soluble proteins, which function in a more polar, aqueous environment. Globular soluble proteins typically have a hydrophobic core and a polar surface that interacts favorably with water. In the fuzzy oil drop (FOD) model, this distribution is represented by the 3D Gauss function (3DG). In contrast, membrane proteins expose hydrophobic residues on the surface, and, in the case of ion channels, the polar residues face inwards towards a central pore. The distribution of hydrophobic residues in membrane proteins can be characterized by means of 1C3DG, a complementary 3D Gauss function. Such an analysis was carried out on the transmembrane proteins of bacteria, which, despite the considerable similarities of their super-secondary structure (-barrel), have highly differentiated properties in terms of stabilization based on hydrophobic interactions. The biological activity and substrate specificity of these proteins are determined by the distribution of the polar and nonpolar amino acids. The present analysis allowed us to compare the ways in which the different proteins interact with antibiotics and helped us understand their relative importance in the development of the resistance mechanism.

RESULTS: Among the 566 patients (median age, 61.5 years) with COVID-19, 267 (47.2%) patients were male and 307 (54.2%) were elderly. Compared with younger patients, older patients had more underlying comorbidities and laboratory abnormalities. A higher rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury and heart failure was observed in the older group as compared with younger and middle-aged groups, particularly those oldest-old patients had more multi-organ damage. Older patients with COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury in cases with preexistenting cardiovascular diseases, while there was no difference among the three groups when patients had no history of cardiovascular diseases. Older patients presented more severe with the mortality of 18.6%, which was higher than that in younger and middle-aged patients (P < 0.05).

Competing risk regression was used to quantify the association between suPAR and the incidence of the primary outcome. RESULTS: 6.2% of patients experienced ARDS or ICU admission, but none died. Taking into account competing risk, the incidence of the primary outcome was 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-16.3) in patients with suPAR levels >3.91 ng/mL compared to 2.9% (95% CI, 0.4-5.5) in those with suPAR &#8804;3.91 ng/mL. Also, an increase by 1 ng/mL in baseline suPAR resulted in a 58% rise in the hazard of developing the primary outcome (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: suPAR has an excellent prognostic utility in predicting severe complications in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","output":"Admission levels of Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) are Associated with the Development of Severe Complications in Hospitalised COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: IFITM3 is a viral restriction protein that enables sequestration of viral particles and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes. Recently, IFITM3 upregulation was found to induce gamma C secretase activity and the production of amyloid beta. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dysregulation of IFITM3-dependent pathways was present in neurons and peripheral immune cells donated by AD patients. As a secondary aim, we sought to determine whether these perturbations could be induced by viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) previously performed on publicly available transcriptomic data from tissues donated by AD patients were screened for enriched pathways containing IFITM3. Subsequently, signature containing IFITM3, derived from entorhinal cortex (EC) neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was screened for overlap with curated, publicly available, viral infection-induced gene signatures (including SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: GSEA determined that IFITM3 gene networks are significantly enriched both in CNS sites (entorhinal and hippocampal cortices) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) donated by AD patients. Overlap screening revealed that IFITM3 signatures are induced by several viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 (adjusted p-value <0.001; Enrichr Database). DISCUSSION: A data-driven analysis of AD tissues revealed IFITM3 gene signatures both in the CNS and in peripheral immune cells. GSEA revealed that an IFITM3 derived gene signature extracted from EC/NFT neurons overlapped with those extracted from publicly available viral infection datasets, including SARS-CoV-2. Our results are in line with currently emerging evidence on IFITM3s role in AD, and SARS-CoV-2s potential contribution in the setting of an expanded antimicrobial protection hypothesis.","output":"Outside-in induction of the IFITM3 trafficking system by infections, including SARS-CoV-2, in the pathobiology of Alzheimers disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The new pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has produced a global tumult and has overburdened national health systems. We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY: In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.","output":"Cardiovascular implications and complications of the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: a world upside down"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As well as the exploration of translatable delivery nanosystems for cancer therapeutic agents, the development of automatable continuous-flow manufacture technology comprising digitally controlled reactions for the on-demand production of pharmaceuticals is an important challenge in anticancer nanomedicine.

However, there has been no report of a platform based on plug-in execution that enables continuous-flow manufacture in a compact, reconfigurable manner, although an optimal platform technology may be a prerequisite for the timely translation of recently developed nanomedicines. To this end, we describe the development of a platform toward digitizable, continuous manufacture by serial combination of plug-in reactionwares (heating plates, a spraying cup, and a photochamber) for single-pass flow fabrication. Specifically, we fabricated three different composite nanoblocks consisting of Au1Ag9 (<8 nanometers; stimulus component), docetaxel (an anticancer drug), and bovine serum albumin (a protective and targeting agent) using our system, with the result of producing nanoblocks with photothermally modulatable and structurally disintegratable properties.

Moreover, regional differences are also conceivable since the extend and severity of outbreaks varied among countries. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational, single-center study, we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of 37 maintenance hemodialysis patients (median age 64 years, 51% men) hospitalized with COVID-19 from 24 March to 22 May 2020 as confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The most common symptoms at admission were fatigue (51%), fever (43%), dyspnea (38%) and cough (35%). There were 59% mild/moderate patients and 41% severe/critical patients. Patients in the severe/critical group had a significantly higher atherosclerotic burden since diabetic kidney disease and vascular nephropathies were the most common primary kidney diseases and eighty percent of them had coronary heart disease. Also, Charlson comorbidity score was higher in this group. At admission chest X-ray, 46% had ground-glass abnormalities. Overall, 60% patients received hydroxychloroquine, 22% lopinavir-ritonavir, 11% tocilizumab, 24% systemic glucocorticoids, and 54% received prophylactic anticoagulation. Seven (19%) patients died during hospitalization and 30 were discharged. The main causes of death were cardiovascular (5 patients) and respiratory distress syndrome (2 patients). In Cox regression analysis, lower oxygen saturation, anemia and hypoalbuminemia at admission were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we observed a high mortality rate among maintenance hemodialysis patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

According to the interview, college students were easy to be emotional instability during the time of online learning, which made their life rhythms disordered, academic performances declined as well as bad mood appeared frequently. Hence, this paper mainly discusses the relationship between online teaching and emotional quotient of college students during the period of epidemic prevention and control. Methods: Based on the interviews with college students, the questionnaire was designed by EIS, IRI-C and Teachers' personality test. We took the college students as Subjects of investigation, and collected 372 effective electronic questionnaires nationally. 12 invalid questionnaires were deleted,372 valid questionnaires remained, and the effective recovery rate was 96.88%. Factor analysis and Hierarchical regression were performed with SPSS 19.0 and Excel to test the correlation and moderating effect. Results: (1) There is a strong correlation between online learning and emotional quotient of college students during the period of epidemic prevention and control. The five main factors that affect the emotional quotient of college students are self-control ability, discernment, interpersonal relationship, self-motivation, teachers' character. (2) The influence of teachers' character on students' interpersonal relationship has an indirect effect on college students' emotional quotient. (3) Self-control ability, discernment, interpersonal relationship, self-motivation, teachers' character and the emotional quotient of college students are in good condition. College students have strong empathy, but low self-control ability. Conclusions: The emotional quotient of college students is affected by internal and external factors. Therefore, to improve the emotional quotient level of college students, we need to pay attention to not only internal factors, but also external factors. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Study on the Relationship between Online Learning and Emotional Quotient of College Students during the Period of Epidemic Prevention and Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present recommendations on performance and safety measures of ultrasound examinations in obstetrics and gynecology during the SARS COV-2 pandemic.

The combination of an exceptionally large single payment and the life-long clinical follow-up needed for understanding the long-term benefits and safety of gene therapy, represent new types of scientific, financial, social and ethical challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and society. With special consideration of the uniqueness and importance of gene therapy, the authors propose a three points plan for a close cooperation between the pharmaceutical industry and society to develop orphan gene therapy. (1) In fully transparent health technology negotiations a close and long-lasting, contractually fixed cooperation should be established between the manufacturers and local health-care stakeholders for sharing the medical and scientific benefits, the financial risks as well as the burdens of the post-authorization clinical and regulatory development. (2) The parties should agree on a fair, locally affordable drug price without the usually very high premium price calculated to compensate for the low number of patients. In case of high manufacturing costs, the companies should offer prolonged, 15C20 years long payment by installment with risk-sharing, especially considering that the late outcome of the treatment is unknown. Society should assist scientifically and financially organizing a specific patient registry, treatment in specialized hospitals and adequate long-term follow-up of patients, the coordinated management of financial transactions related to the risk sharing program. (3) The post-authorization treatment and prolonged observation of additional new cases coordinated by society should provide real world data needed for the modern complex regulatory evaluation of gene therapy products by the competent authorities. We assume that fair sharing of the benefits and risks as well as a well-organized cooperation of society with the industry in collecting real world evidence might result in better drug evaluation and improved accessibility due to lower prices.

The measurements of peripheral blood lymphocytes subsets and cytokine levels were performed by flow cytometry for 57 COVID\\\\19 patients. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the severity of the disease (nonsevere vs. severe). Total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells were decreased in COVID\\\\19 patients and statistical differences were found among different severity of illness and survival states (P ? 0.01). The levels of IL\\\\6 and IL\\\\10 were significantly higher in severe and death groups and negatively correlated with lymphocyte subsets counts. The percentages of Th17 in the peripheral blood of patients were higher than those of healthy controls whereas the percentages of Th2 were lower. For the severe cases, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of IL\\\\6 was the largest among all the immune parameters (0.964; 95% confidence interval: 0.927C1.000, P < 0.0001). In addition, the preoperative IL\\\\6 concentration of 77.38 pg/ml was the optimal cutoff value (sensitivity: 84.6%, specificity: 100%). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis and ROC curves, IL\\\\6 > 106.44 pg/ml and CD8+ T cell counts <150 cells/l were found to be associated with mortality.

Study Design A retrospective chart review for patients seen via telemedicine was conducted between March 2020 and December 2020. Sociodemographic information, home ZIP code, referring doctor and type of insurance, and clinical diagnosis were collected and entered into an electronic database. The pain score was recorded at each visit using a 0 to 10 scale. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate median and range. Differences in oral pain were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results A total of 137 new patients were included (57% female), with a median age of 56 years (range, 3-89). If seen in person, patients would have traveled a median distance of 65 miles (range, 0.9-100). More than half of the patients (n = 82; 59.8%) were referred by physicians, with the greatest proportion coming from primary care physicians (n = 47; 34.3%) and otolaryngologists (n = 17; 12%). The most common oral conditions seen were reactive/inflammatory lesions (n = 70; 51%), orofacial pain disorders (n = 18; 13.1%), and immune-mediated conditions (n = 17; 12.4%). One third of patients (n = 51; 37%) required an oral biopsy. Imaging and laboratory studies were ordered in 9.4% and 2.1% patients, respectively. Most patients (n = 92; 67.1%) had their visit covered by private medical insurance, 9 by dental insurance (6.5%), and 31 by Medicare (22.6%%), and 5 were self-pay (3.6%).

Within the service, difficulties in engagement have been reflected in the high no-show rates observed in the Foundation Year 2 trainee doctor-led physical health clinic. This quality improvement project aimed to reduce the did not attend (DNA) rate in the physical health clinic by 20% in order to improve patient outcomes, particularly in the context of their physical health. Method The project took place between September and November 2020, over the course of 10 weeks. A driver diagram was constructed to identify key influencing factors and subsequent change ideas. In order to implement each of these changes, three cycles within the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) ramp framework were completed. These consisted of phone reminders within 48 hours of appointments, a teaching session for staff alongside the distribution of an accompanying information leaflet and increased flexibility in clinic times with opportunistic appointments. The change ideas were cumulative with each cycle lasting a duration of seventeen days. Result The baseline DNA rate was calculated based on the preceding month and found to be 55%. Following cycle one of the project, there was a significant reduction in DNA rates to 30% although this remained relatively stable at 33% after cycle two. By the end of cycle three when all interventions had been introduced, the DNA rate had dropped to 22%. As such, a total drop in DNA rate of over 30% was achieved which surpassed the initial aim of the project. Conclusion The outcomes of this project demonstrate that the introduction of even simple measures can lead to positive change. Successful implementation of these changes requires teamwork and a culture of openness and flexibility. Feedback from team members, particularly care coordinators, also indicated better resulting engagement of clients with the service overall, suggesting potential for both improved mental and physical health outcomes.

Conjunctival congestion is an uncommon manifestation of COVID-19 similar to all human coronaviruses infections. In a low percentage of patients, the virus can be excreted in ocular fluids at different stages of the infection, regardless of positive SARS-Cov-2 throat swab.

METHODS: Within the context of a larger multi-method, interdisciplinary research project, we conducted six focus group discussions and 33 semi-structured interviews with nurses at nursing homes in northern Germany between September 2020 and April 2021. Discussions and interviews focused on emergency management in nursing homes, and were recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis, according to Mayring. RESULTS: Nurses reported that relatives were actively involved in emergency management in the nursing homes. Relatives were informed when there was an emergency situation, and they participated in decision making around the residents care. Nurses sometimes perceived the involvement of relatives as challenging, due to a lack of time or staff, the opposing views of relatives and/or uncertain communication structures; however, they were willing to involve relatives according to the relatives preferences. The role played by relatives was seen to range from that of an active supporter to that of a troublemaker. On the one hand, relatives were reported to support nurses in emergency management (i.e. by identifying residents preferences and advocating for residents interests). On the other hand, relatives were often perceived by the nurses as overstrained and unprepared in emergency situations, leading them to override residents wishes, question the emergency plan and put pressure on the nurses decision making.

CONCLUSION: AAV is associated with a high risk of certain types of CV events, particularly in the early period following diagnosis.","output":"Association of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and cardiovascular events: a population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic, especially among the elderly. Our study aimed to explore the risk factors and identify the blood pressure control targets associated with the clinical outcome of elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Methods: : In this retrospective cohort study, elderly COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital from February 8 to 17, 2020 was included. Demographic, medical history, clinical data, and laboratory test data were collected from medical records. The adverse clinical outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Difference between hypertension and non-hypertension groups were compared. Hypertension group were further divided into 3 subgroups according to their maximum blood pressures. KaplanCMeier (KCM) method was used to find the differences both between hyperntesion and non-hypertension groups, and among the 3 hypertension subgroups. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to find risk factors. Results: : All 133 elderly COVID-19 patients (79 patients with hypertension) were included. (1) Univariate analysis between hypertension and non-hypertension patients showed most laboratory tests were significantly (P < 0.05, or P < 0.01), particularly in adverse clinical outcomes (32.91% vs 7.41% at 30 days, P < 0.05). (2) Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models confirmed hypertension (HR 3.202, 95% CI:1.164 - 8.807) were the most important independent risk factors of outcomes in elderly patients, as well as low lymphocyte count, while the statistical difference of other values diminished. (3) Hypertension group were further divided into 3 subgroups according to their maximum blood pressures. K-M analysis showed maximum systolic blood pressure (SBP) 160mmHg subgroup (P < 0.01) and maximum blood pressure (DBP) 90mmHg subgroup (P < 0.05) experienced more adverse outcomes than others. (4) Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model confirmed that maximum SBP160mmHg and maximum DBP 90mmHg were risk factors (HR 8.279, 95% CI: 1.346, 50.914;HR 5.080, 95% CI: 1.606,16.071;respectively). Conclusions: : Hypertension is the most important independent risk factor of adverse outcomes in elderly COVID-19 patients, controlling the maximum blood pressure levels under 160/90 mmHg will decrease large part risks of adverse outcomes, the first week are key treatment period for patient prognosis.","output":"Risk Factors and Blood Pressure Control Targets Associated With the Clinical Outcome of Elderly COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension: a Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoV) have recently emerged as potentially serious pathogens that can cause significant human morbidity and death. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV was identified as the etiologic agent of the 2002-2003 international SARS outbreak. Yet, how SARS evades innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that a protein encoded by SARS-CoV designated as open reading frame-9b (ORF-9b) localizes to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial elongation by triggering ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of dynamin-like protein 1, a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Also, acting on mitochondria, ORF-9b targets the mitochondrial-associated adaptor molecule MAVS signalosome by usurping PCBP2 and the HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF 6. This severely limits host cell IFN responses. Reducing either PCBP2 or AIP4 expression substantially reversed the ORF-9b-mediated reduction of MAVS and the suppression of antiviral transcriptional responses. Finally, transient ORF-9b expression led to a strong induction of autophagy in cells. The induction of autophagy depended upon ATG5, a critical autophagy regulator, but the inhibition of MAVS signaling did not. These results indicate that SARS-CoV ORF-9b manipulates host cell mitochondria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity. This study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and illustrates the havoc that a small ORF can cause in cells.","output":"SARS-coronavirus open reading frame-9b suppresses innate immunity by targeting mitochondria and the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The work proposes a mathematical model of the process of COVID-19 epidemic as it evolved in New Zealand.

The degree to which AI can improve outcomes in these and other domains depends on how comfortable people are trusting AI for these tasks, which in turn depends on lay perceptions of AI. The present research examines how these critical lay perceptions may vary as a function of conservatism. Using five survey experiments, we find that political conservatism is associated with low comfort with and trust in AIi.e., with AI aversion. This relationship between conservatism and AI aversion is explained by the link between conservatism and risk perception; more conservative individuals perceive AI as being riskier and are therefore more averse to its adoption. Finally, we test whether a moral reframing intervention can reduce AI aversion among conservatives.","output":"Conservatism predicts aversion to consequential Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In an unprecedented situation of interruption of the sporting dynamics, the world of sport is going through a series of adaptations necessary to continue functioning despite coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) More than ever, athletes are facing a different challenge, a source of discomfort and uncertainty, and one that absolutely alters not only sports calendars, but also trajectories, progressions, and approaches to sports life Therefore, it is necessary to identify the levels of psychological vulnerability that may have been generated in the athletes, because of the coexistence with dysfunctional responses during the COVID-19 experience, and which directly influence the decrease of their mental health","output":"\\"Oh, My God!

Although severe COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of active viral replication, the immune response to asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 remains unknown. Here, we assessed immunological adaptations in both blood and term decidua from 9 SARS-exposed pregnant women with asymptomatic/mild disease and 15 pregnant SARS-naive women. In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages. On the other hand, infection was associated with remodeling of the T cell compartment with increased frequencies of activated CD69+ tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of Tregs. Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood. The resulting aberrant immune activation in the placenta, even with asymptomatic disease may alter the exquisitely sensitive developing fetal immune system, leading to long-term adverse outcomes for offspring.","output":"Deep immune profiling of the maternal-fetal interface with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we explore why solidarity has not worked according to expectation in EU migration and asylum law and why it is unlikely to work in the future. First, we consider discourses of burden-sharing and solidarity in EU law from the 1990s up to the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 to identify emergent path dependencies. This period saw the introduction of primary law provisions on solidarity, such as Article 80 TFEU, as French and Dutch electorates had rejected a European constitution. Second, we perform an analysis of Article 80 through the conceptual history of solidarity, in particular, the dominant Roman law tradition of obligation in solidum and the French tradition of solidarism. We submit that the term solidarity is actually a misnomer: already on structural grounds, Article 80 should be read as an alliance clause, countering a threat of irregular immigration. Third, we find that the practice under Article 80 as it develops during the period between 2015 and the 2020 European Commission Pact on Migration and Asylum corroborates this finding. Overall, we find that the concept of solidarity in EU asylum and migration law engenders outcome expectations that it cannot deliver as the defence alliance it is.","output":"What Is Wrong with Solidarity in EU Asylum and Migration Law?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by the structural optimization principle and the promising anticancer effect of the quinoxaline nucleus, a new series of novel HDAC inhibitors were designed and synthesized. The synthesized compounds were designed to bear the reported pharmacophoric features of the HDAC inhibitors in addition to an extra moiety to occupy the non-used vacant deep pocket of the HDAC receptor. The newly prepared compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities against HepG-2 and HuH-7 liver cancer cell lines. The tested compounds showed promising anti-proliferative activities against both cell lines. The most active ten candidates (6 (c), 6 (d), 6 (f), 6 (g), 6 (k), 6 (l), 7 (b), 8, 10 (h), and 12) were further evaluated for their effect on the gene expression levels of Bax as an apoptotic marker and Bcl-2 as an anti-apoptotic one. Moreover, they were evaluated for their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC6) activities. Compound 6 (c) achieved the best cytotoxic activities on both HepG-2 and HuH-7 cell lines with IC(50) values of 1.53 and 3.06 M, respectively, and also it showed the most inhibitory activities on HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC6 with IC(50) values of 1.76, 1.39, and 3.46 M, respectively, compared to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) as a reference drug (IC(50) = 0.86, 0.97, and 0.93 M, respectively). Furthermore, it achieved a more characteristic arrest in the growth of cell population of HepG-2 at both G0/G1 and S phases with 1.23-, and 1.18-fold, respectively, compared to that of the control, as determined by cell cycle analysis. Also, compound 6 (c) showed a marked elevation in the AnxV-FITC apoptotic HepG-2 cells percentage in both early and late phases increasing the total apoptosis percentage by 9.98-, and 10.81-fold, respectively, compared to the control. Furthermore, docking studies were carried out to identify the proposed binding mode of the synthesized compounds towards the prospective target (HDAC4). In silico ADMET and toxicity studies revealed that most of the synthesized compounds have accepted profiles of drug-likeness with low toxicity.

Objectives: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. Methods: : We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. Results: : Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%;p=0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%;p=0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p<0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p=0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables.

Even if non-transplant critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) have serious CA-RVI, comparison between these groups remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and mortality of CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. METHODS: We collected 37,777 CA-RVs multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals aged &#8805;18 years from November 2012 to November 2017. The CA-RVs tests included adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. RESULTS: We found 286 CA-RVI cases, including 85 solid organ transplantation recipients (G1), 61 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (G2), and 140 non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (G3), excluding those with repeated isolation within 30 days. Adenovirus positive rate and infection cases were most prominent in G2 (p < 0.001). The median time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was 30 and 20 months in G1 and G2, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 or G2 (51.4% vs. 28.2% or 39.3%, p = 0.002, respectively).

The latest guidelines recommend hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and facemask use. However, public willingness in this setup remains unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional, unrestricted volunteer Internet survey was conducted to assess individuals attitudes and behaviors toward performing BCPR, pre-existing CPR training, occupational identity, age group, and gender. The raking method for weights and a regression analysis for the predictors of willingness were performed. RESULTS: Among 1,347 eligible respondents, 822 (61%) had negative attitudes toward performing BCPR. Healthcare providers (HCPs) and those with pre-existing CPR training had fewer negative attitudes (p < 0.001); HCPs and those with pre-existing CPR training and unchanged attitude showed more positive behaviors toward BCPR (p < 0.001). Further, 9.7% of the respondents would absolutely refuse to perform BCPR. In contrast, 16.9% would perform BCPR directly despite the outbreak. Approximately 9.9% would perform it if they were instructed, 23.5%, if they wore facemasks, and 40.1%, if they were to perform hands-only CPR. Interestingly, among the 822 respondents with negative attitudes, over 85% still tended to perform BCPR in the abovementioned situations. The weighted analysis showed similar results. The adjusted predictors for lower negative attitudes toward BCPR were younger age, being a man, and being an HCP; those for more positive behaviors were younger age and being an HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on attitudes and behaviors toward BCPR. Younger individuals, men, HCPs, and those with pre-existing CPR training tended to show fewer negative attitudes and behaviors.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of vedolizumab (VDZ), a gut-selective anti-integrin, on COVID-19 outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for IBD (SECURE-IBD), an international registry of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19, we studied the impact of VDZ on COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation and/or death). RESULTS: Of 3,647 adult patients on any IBD medication in the registry, 457 (12.5%) patients were on VDZ. On multivariable analyses using backward selection of covariates, VDZ use was not associated with hospitalization or severe COVID-19 when comparing to patients on all other medications [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 1.1 and aOR 0.95; 95% CI 0.53; 1.73, respectively]. On comparing VDZ monotherapy to anti-TNF monotherapy, the odds for hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, were higher (aOR CI 1.39; 95% CI 1.001, 1.90 and aOR 2.92; 95% CI 0.98, 8.71, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, VDZ monotherapy, compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, was associated with new-onset GI symptoms at the time of COVID-19, especially among patients whose IBD was in remission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes among IBD patients on VDZ are comparable to those on all other therapies.

This study relies on simple subcellular fractionation used to obtain soluble- and membrane-enriched fractions followed by 2-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The cells were collected using a brushing technique applied on NE of clinically evaluated volunteers. Subsequently, the soluble- and the membrane-protein enriched fractions were prepared and analyzed in parallel using 2D-LC-MS/MS. In a set of 1482 identified proteins, 947 (63.9%) proteins were found to be associated to membrane fraction. Grand average hydropathy value index (GRAVY) analysis, the transmembrane protein mapping and annotations of primary location deposited in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) confirmed an enrichment of hydrophobic proteins on this dataset. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of soluble fraction revealed an enrichment of molecular and cellular functions associated with cell death, protein folding and drug metabolism while in membrane fraction showed an enrichment of functions associated with molecular transport, protein trafficking and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. The IPA showed similar enrichment of functions associated with cellular growth and proliferation in both soluble and membrane subproteomes. This finding was in agreement with protein content analysis using exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). A comparison of our data with previously published studies focusing on respiratory tract epithelium revealed similarities related to identification of proteins associated with physical barrier function and immunological defence. In summary, we extended the NE molecular profile by identifying and characterizing proteins associated to pivotal functions of a respiratory epithelium, including the control of fluid volume and ionic composition at the airways' surface, physical barrier maintenance, detoxification and immunological defence. The extent of similarities supports the applicability of a less invasive analysis of NE to assess prognosis and treatment response of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","output":"Molecular profiling of the human nasal epithelium: A proteomics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease-19 is a high-risk procedure that should be performed with personal protective equipment (PPE).

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of simulation studies to evaluate the influence of wearing PPE as compared to standard uniform regarding time-to-intubation (TTI) and success rate. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to device used and operators experience. RESULTS: The TTI was prolonged when wearing PPE (eight studies): Standard Mean Difference (SMD) -0.54, 95% Confidence Interval [-0.75, -0.34], p < 0.0001. Subgroup analyses according to device used showed similar findings (direct laryngoscopy, SMD -0.63 [-0.88, -0.38], p < 0.0001; videolaryngoscopy, SMD -0.39 [-0.75, -0.02], p = 0.04). Considering the operators experience, non-anesthesiologists had prolonged TTI (SMD -0.75 [-0.98, -0.52], p < 0.0001) while the analysis on anesthesiologists did not show significant differences (SMD -0.25 [-0.51, 0.01], p = 0.06). The success rate of tracheal intubation was not influenced by PPE: Risk Ratio (RR) 1.02 [1.00, 1.04]; p = 0.12). Subgroup analyses according to device demonstrated similar results (direct laryngoscopy, RR 1.03 [0.99, 1.07], p = 0.15, videolaryngoscopy, RR 1.01 [0.98, 1.04], p = 0.52). Wearing PPE had a trend towards negative influence on success rate in non-anesthesiologists (RR 1.05 [1.00, 1.10], p = 0.05), but not in anesthesiologists (RR 1.00 [0.98, 1.03], p = 0.84). Trial-sequential analyses for TTI and success rate indicated robustness of both results. CONCLUSIONS: Under simulated conditions, wearing PPE delays the TTI as compared to dressing standard uniform, with no influence on the success rate. However, certainty of evidence is very low.

Several respiratory pathogens are circulating simultaneously and typical symptoms of different respiratory infections are alike, meaning it is challenging to identify and diagnose different respiratory pathogens based on symptoms alone. mariPOC? is an automated, multianalyte antigen test which allows the rapid detection of nine respiratory infection pathogens [influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1C3 viruses and pneumococci] from a single nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate samples, and, in addition, can be linked to laboratory information systems. During the study period from November 2010 to June 2014, a total of 22,485 multianalyte respi tests were performed in the 14 participating laboratories in Finland and, in total, 6897 positive analyte results were recorded. Of the tested samples, 25 % were positive for one respiratory pathogen, with RSV (9.8 %) and influenza A virus (7.2 %) being the most common findings, and 0.65 % of the samples were multivirus-positive. Only small geographical variations in seasonal epidemics occurred. Our results show that the mariPOC? multianalyte respi test allows simultaneous detection of several respiratory pathogens in real time. The results are reliable and give the clinician a picture of the current epidemiological situation, thus minimising guesswork.","output":"Comprehensive real-time epidemiological data from respiratory infections in Finland between 2010 and 2014 obtained from an automated and multianalyte mariPOC? respiratory pathogen test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Media sources have consistently described older adults as a medically vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet a lack of concern over their health and safety has resulted in dismissal and devaluation. This unprecedented situation highlights ongoing societal ageism and its manifestations in public discourse. This analysis asks how national news sources performed explicit and implicit ageism during the first month of the pandemic. METHODS: Using content and critical discourse analysis methods, we analyzed 287 articles concerning older adults and COVID-19 published between March 11 and April 10, 2020, in four major U.S.-based newspapers. RESULTS: Findings indicate that while ageism was rarely discussed explicitly, ageist bias was evident in implicit reporting patterns (e.g., frequent use of the term \\"elderly,\\" portrayals of older adults as \\"vulnerable\\"). Infection and death rates and institutionalized care were among the most commonly reported topics, providing a limited portrait of aging during the pandemic. The older \\"survivor\\" narrative offers a positive alternative by suggesting exceptional examples of resilience and grit. However, the survivor narrative may also implicitly place blame on those unable to survive or thrive in later life. DISCUSSION: This study provides insight for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners exploring societal perceptions of older adults and how these perceptions are disseminated and maintained by the media.","output":"Ageism in COVID-Related Newspaper Coverage: The First Month of a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAt the start of the Coronavirus pandemic the UK Government pledged to house all rough-sleepers in temporary accommodation.

Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used.

In recent years, cordycepin has received increasing attention owing to its multiple pharmacological activities. This study reviews recent researches on the anti-inflammatory effects and the related activities of cordycepin. The results from our review indicate that cordycepin exerts protective effects against inflammatory injury for many diseases including acute lung injury (ALI), asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease (PD), hepatitis, atherosclerosis, and atopic dermatitis. Cordycepin regulates the NF-&#954;B, RIP2/Caspase-1, Akt/GSK-3?/p70S6K, TGF-?/Smads, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways among others. Several studies focusing on cordycepin derivatives were reviewed and found to down metabolic velocity of cordycepin and increase its bioavailability. Moreover, cordycepin enhanced immunity, inhibited the proliferation of viral RNA, and suppressed cytokine storms, thereby suggesting its potential to treat COVID-19 and other viral infections. From the collected and reviewed information, this article provides the theoretical basis for the clinical applications of cordycepin and discusses the path for future studies focusing on expanding the medicinal use of cordycepin.

BACKGROUND Despite restoration of epicardial blood flow during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), one-third of patients do not obtain myocardial perfusion due to impairment in the microvascular circulation. METHODS We examined the effect of symptom onset-to-balloon time (SBT) and door-to-balloon time (DBT) on myocardial reperfusion during primary PCI in STEMI, utilizing resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) and the myocardial blush grade (MBG). The primary analysis was the relationships between SBT 2, >2 to 4, and >4 h and DBT 1, >1 to 1.5, >1.5 to 2, and >2 h with MBG and STR. Clinical risk was assessed using a modified version of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score for STEMI. RESULTS In 2,056 patients, absent microvascular perfusion (MBG 0/1) and STR (STR <30%) after primary PCI was significantly more common in patients with longer SBT, in patients with both low and high clinical risk profiles. By multivariable analysis, SBT (p < 0.0001), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), reference vessel diameter (p = 0.005), lesion minimum lumen diameter (p < 0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and current smoking (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of MBG 0/1, whereas SBT (p = 0.007), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), and history of renal insufficiency (p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of absent STR. DBT (p < 0.0001) was an independent predictor of MBG 0/1. MBG 0/1 and STR<30% identified patients with increased 3-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that delay in mechanical reperfusion therapy during STEMI is associated with greater injury to the microcirculation.","output":"Effect of Ischemia Duration and Door-to-Balloon Time on Myocardial Perfusion in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: An Analysis From HORIZONS-AMI Trial (Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 period, individuals who physically isolated themselves from the social environment increased their screen time compared to before, and the time spent in the family environment increased.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the causal relationships of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels on five types of aneurysms, using genetic variants associated with four lipid traits as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Methods: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to evaluate the associations of HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, and TG levels with risks for five types of aneurysms and those of LDL-C- (HMGCR, NPC1L1, PCSK9, CETP, and LDLR) and TG-lowering targets (ANGPTL3 and LPL) with aneurysms. Results: The sample sizes of the included studies ranged from nearly 80,000 to 410,000. We found inverse associations between genetically predicted HDL-C levels and aortic (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.65C0.85) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (0.58, 0.45C0.75). A 1-SD increase in LDL-C and TC levels was associated with increased risks for aortic (1.41, 1.26C1.58 and 1.36, 1.18C1.56, respectively) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (1.82, 1.48C2.22 and 1.55, 1.25C1.93, respectively). TG levels were significantly associated with aortic (1.36, 1.18C1.56) and lower extremity artery aneurysms (2.76, 1.48C5.14), but limited to cerebral aneurysm (1.23, 1.06C1.42).

Rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in clinical trials of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are unexpectedly low. Objectives: We conducted an observational single-center study to determine the prevalence and etiology of bacterial superinfection at the time of initial intubation and the incidence and etiology of subsequent bacterial VAP in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods: Bronchoscopic BAL fluid samples from all patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation were analyzed using quantitative cultures and a multiplex PCR panel. Actual antibiotic use was compared with guideline-recommended therapy. Measurements and Main Results: We analyzed 386 BAL samples from 179 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Bacterial superinfection within 48 hours of intubation was detected in 21% of patients. Seventy-two patients (44.4%) developed at least one VAP episode (VAP incidence rate = 45.2/1,000 ventilator days); 15 (20.8%) initial VAPs were caused by difficult-to-treat pathogens. The clinical criteria did not distinguish between patients with or without bacterial superinfection. BAL-based management was associated with significantly reduced antibiotic use compared with guideline recommendations. Conclusions: In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation, bacterial superinfection at the time of intubation occurs in <25% of patients. Guideline-based empirical antibiotic management at the time of intubation results in antibiotic overuse.

Concerto leverages dropout layer as minimal data augmentation to learn meaningful cell representations in a contrastive manner. The teacher module uses attention mechanism to aggregate contextualized gene embeddings within cellular context, while the student module uses simpler dense structure with discreate input. The learned task-agnostic representations can be adapted to a broad range of single-cell computation tasks. 1) Via supervised fine-tuning, Concerto enables automatic cell classification as well as novel cell-type discovery;2) Attention weights provide model interpretability via automatically extracting specific molecular signatures at single-cell resolution without the needs of clustering;3) Via source-aware training, Concerto supports efficient data integration by projecting all cells across multiple batches into a joint embedding space. 4) Via batch-aware inference or unsupervised fine-tuning, Concerto enables mapping query cells onto reference and accurately transferring annotations. Concerto can flexibly extend to multi-omics datasets simply through cross-modality summation operation to obtain unified cell embeddings. Using examples from human peripheral blood, human thymus, human pancreas, and mouse tissue atlas, Concerto shows superior performance benchmarking against other top-performing methods. We also demonstrate Concerto recapitulates detailed COVID-19 disease variation through query-to-reference mapping. Concerto can operate on all genes and represents a fully data-driven approach with minimum prior distribution assumptions, eliminating the needs of PCA-like or autoencoder-like dimensionality reduction, which significantly reforms the current best practice.

With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150 times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than 2 m advection range of the respiratory droplets within 1 sec. Employing Lagrangian statistics, we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude increase in their lifetimes, implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory events than the large ones.

Penetration of PV into cells was monitored by using complexes in which the purified PV capsids were physically linked to DNA containing the gene for beta-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression of beta-galactosidase occurred in < 1% of the cells, and the efficiency of PV receptor-mediated gene delivery was greatly enhanced (up to 10 to 20% positive cells) by the use of a replication-defective adenovirus which promotes endosomal lysis. The data generated by this approach further confirmed the results obtained from the binding assays, showing that PV enter a wide range of cells and that these cells have all functions required for the uptake of PV. Binding and uptake of PV particles can be blocked by PV-specific antisera, and different PV particles compete for particle uptake. Our results suggest that the PV receptor is a conserved cell surface molecule(s) used by different PV and that the tropism of infection by different PV is controlled by events downstream of the initial binding and uptake.","output":"Papillomavirus capsid binding and uptake by cells from different tissues and species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based psychotherapy method designed to treat distress associated with traumatic memories. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged providers to shift EMDR to telehealth platforms. Objectives: This research had to aims. (1) To compare EMDR in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with CBT alone for treatment of a patient population with prevalent anxiety and (2) to compare the efficacy of virtual EMDR with that of in-person EMDR in the primary care setting. Methods: Retrospective chart review of all adult patients seen by a single therapist at a primary care center was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020. Charts were reviewed for demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, number of visits, number and type of EMDR treatments, and patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scores pre- and post-treatment. Results: Patients who underwent EMDR with CBT demonstrated greater decreases in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores than patients who had only CBT (2.4, 2.5 vs. 0.9, 1.1). However, after adjusting for total number of sessions, post-traumatic stress disorder, grief, and pain, the adjusted mean differences of change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between those who underwent EMDR with CBT and CBT-exclusive patients were not statistically significant. Similarly, the adjusted mean differences of change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between those who underwent virtual EMDR and those who had in-person EMDR were not statistically significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the use of virtual EMDR in a primary care setting. Although our data did not provide evidence for the superiority of EMDR with CBT over CBT alone, we demonstrate that both in-person and virtual EMDR led to significantly improved GAD-7 scores.","output":"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in a Primary Care Setting: Assessing Utility and Comparing Efficacy of Virtual Versus In-Person Methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article compares the early phases of the constitutional redrafting processes in Venezuela (1999) and currently in Chile (2021), seeking to identify key factors that help explain the radical constitutional-redrafting path that was followed in Venezuela, versus the more moderate, consensual and rule-bounded transformation underway in Chile.

We sought to characterise what is known about FRP in the UHC context and to identify evidence gaps to prioritise in future research. DESIGN Scoping overview of reviews using the Arksey & O'Malley and Levac & Colquhoun framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL-Plus and PAIS Index were systematically searched for studies published between 1 January 1995 and 20 July 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Records were screened by two independent reviewers in duplicate using the following criteria: (1) literature review; (2) focus on UHC achievement through FRP; (3) English or French language; (4) published after 1995 and (5) peer-reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers extracted data using a standard form and descriptive content analysis was performed to synthesise findings. RESULTS 50 studies were included. Most studies were systematic reviews focusing on low-income and middle-income countries. Study periods spanned 1990 and 2020. While FRP was recognised as a dimension of UHC, it was rarely defined as a concept. Out-of-pocket, catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditures were most commonly used to measure FRP. Pooling arrangements, expansion of insurance coverage and financial incentives were the main interventions for achieving FRP. Evidence gaps pertained to the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity implications of efforts aimed at increasing FRP. Methodological gaps related to trade-offs between single-country and multicountry analyses; lack of process evaluations; inadequate mixed-methods evidence, disaggregated by relevant characteristics; lack of comparable and standardised measurement and short follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS This scoping overview of reviews characterised what is known about FRP as a UHC dimension and found evidence gaps related to the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity implications of FRP interventions. Theory-informed mixed-methods research using high-quality, longitudinal and disaggregated data is needed to address these objectives.","output":"Identifying priorities for research on financial risk protection to achieve universal health coverage: a scoping overview of reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thousands of people have lost their life by COVID-19 infection Authorities have seen the calamities caused by the corona virus in China So, when the trace of virus was found in India, the only possible way to stop the spread of the virus was to go into lockdown In a country like India where a major part of the population depends on the daily wages, being in lockdown started affecting their life People where tend to go out for getting the food items and other essentials, and this caused the spread of virus Many were infected and many lost their life by this Due to the pandemic, the whole world was affected and many people working in foreign countries lost their jobs as well These people who came back to India caused further spread of the virus The main reason for the spread is lack of hygiene and a proper system to monitor the symptoms Even though our country was in lockdown for almost 6 months the number of COVID cases doesn't get diminished It is not practical to extend the lockdown any further, and people have decided to live with the virus But it is essential to take the necessary precautions while interacting with the society Automated system for checking that all the COVID protocols are followed and early symptom identification before entering to a place are essential to stop the spread of the infection This research work proposes a smart door system, which evaluates the COVID-19 risk factors and collects the data of person before entering into any place, thereby ensuring that non-infected people are only entering to the place and thus the spread of virus can be avoided ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Smart Door System with COVID-19 Risk Factor Evaluation, Contactless Data Acquisition and Sanitization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantification of habitability is a complex task. Previous attempts at measuring habitability are well documented. Classification of exoplanets, on the other hand, is a different approach and depends on quality of training data available in habitable exoplanet catalogs. Classification is the task of predicting labels of newly discovered planets based on available class labels in the catalog. We present analytical exploration of novel activation functions as consequence of integration of several ideas leading to implementation and subsequent use in habitability classification of exoplanets. Neural networks, although a powerful engine in supervised methods, often require expensive tuning efforts for optimized performance. Habitability classes are hard to discriminate, especially when attributes used as hard markers of separation are removed from the data set. The solution is approached from the point of investigating analytical properties of the proposed activation functions. The theory of ordinary differential equations and fixed point are exploited to justify the lack of tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance compared to traditional activation functions. Additionally, the relationship between the proposed activation functions and the more popular ones is established through extensive analytical and empirical evidence. Finally, the activation functions have been implemented in plain vanilla feed-forward neural network to classify exoplanets. The mathematical exercise supplements the grand idea of classifying exoplanets, computing habitability scores/indices and automatic grouping of the exoplanets converging at some level.","output":"Evolution of novel activation functions in neural network training for astronomy data: habitability classification of exoplanets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic vascular damage with micro/macro-thrombosis is a typical feature of severe COVID-19. However, the pathogenesis of this damage and its predictive biomarkers remain poorly defined. For this reason, in this study, serum monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 and P- and E-selectin levels were analyzed in 204 patients with COVID-19. Serum MCP-2 and P-selectin were significantly higher in hospitalized patients compared with asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, MCP-2 increased with the WHO stage in hospitalized patients. After 1 week of hospitalization, MCP-2 levels were significantly reduced, while P-selectin increased in patients in WHO stage 3 and decreased in patients in WHO stages 5C7. Serum E-selectin was not significantly different between asymptomatic and hospitalized patients. The lower MCP-2 levels after 1 week suggest that endothelial damage triggered by monocytes occurs early in COVID-19 disease progression. MCP-2 may also predict COVID-19 severity. The increase in P-selectin levels, which further increased in mild patients and reduced in severe patients after 1 week of hospitalization, suggests that the inactive form of the protein produced by the cleavage of the active protein from the platelet membrane is present. This may be used to identify a subset of patients that would benefit from targeted therapies. The unchanged levels of E-selectin in these patients suggest that endothelial damage is less relevant.","output":"Further Findings Concerning Endothelial Damage in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to coronavirus pandemic, governments have ordered a nationwide isolation. In this situation, we hypothesised that people holding conspiracy beliefs are less willing to adhere to medical guidelines. Furthermore, we explored what possible factors may modify relationships between conspiracy, paranoia-like beliefs, and adherence to epidemiological guidelines. Also, we examined the prevalence of different coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. METHODS: Two independent internet studies. Study 1 used a proportional quota sample that was representative of the population of Poles in terms of gender and settlement size (n=507). Study 2 employed a convenience sample (n=840). RESULTS: Coronavirus conspiracy beliefs are negatively related to safety guidelines. Mixed results suggest that paranoia-like beliefs are related negatively to safety guidelines. Prevalence of firmly held coronavirus conspiracy beliefs is rare. Nevertheless, certain percentage of participants agree with conspiracy beliefs at least partially. Coronavirus related anxiety, trust in media, and internal motivation to isolation moderate the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and adherence to safety guidelines. Paranoia-like beliefs partially mediate between boredom and conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Conspiracy beliefs concerning coronavirus are present in the population and are negatively related to adherence to safety guidelines. Conspiracy beliefs originate partially from boredom and paranoia proneness. Certain factors C trust in media and internal motivation to isolation C are potentially worthwhile to address to enhance adherence to safety guidelines.

We offered MSC infusion as an extended indication to all critically ill COVID-19 patients with a Horovitz index <100. We treated 5 out of 23 patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS with an infusion of MSCs. One million MSCs/kg body weight was infused over 30 minutes, and the process was repeated in 3 patients twice and in 2 patients 3 times. RESULT: Four out of 5 MSC-treated patients compared to 50% of control patients (9 out of 18) received ECMO support (80%). The MSC group showed a higher Murray score on admission than control patients, reflecting more severe pulmonary compromise (3.5  0.2 versus 2.8  0.3). MSC infusion was safe and well tolerated. The MSC group had a significantly higher Horovitz score on discharge than the control group. Compared to controls, patients with MSC treatment showed a significantly lower Murray score upon discharge than controls. In the MSC group, 4 out of 5 patients (80%) survived to discharge and exhibited good pulmonary function, whereas only 8 out of 18 patients (45%) in the control group survived to discharge.

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigacin Farmacoepidemiolgica en Atencin Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (390%) were female and the mean age was 691 years (SD 154), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 198, 95% CI 162C241) and risk factors (146, 123C173) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 094 (95% CI 077C115). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 080, 064C100) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (110, 088C137). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 053, 95% CI 034C080). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire was applied to healthcare workers working at Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine and University of Kyrenia, Dr. Suat Gnsel Hospital, to evaluate the coronavirus disease 2019 awareness and level of knowledge. RESULTS A total of 598 healthcare workers participated in the study. Two-thirds of the respondents were from Turkey, while one-third were from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The general symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 were well known in the general population. Awareness of most symptoms was significantly lower in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus group. It was well known that coronavirus disease 2019 can be asymptomatic in some patients and it can be contagious. The necessity of wearing surgical masks on sick individuals was less known in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus group (96.6% vs 61.6%; P = .000). While handwashing was found similar in both groups for protection from coronavirus disease 2019 transmission, social distance and mask recommendations were lower in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus group (P < .05). The concern about transmitting the virus to themselves and their relatives was more significant in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus group than the Turkey group (84.4% vs 96.5%; P = .000). And 92.2% of the healthcare workers thought they should stay in an alternative place instead of their homes. CONCLUSION The awareness and knowledge level of coronavirus disease 2019 is higher in Turkey than in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus related to the increased number of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in Turkey.

Crowding effects, exhibiting a certain spatial extent between target and flankers, can be reduced by perceptual learning. In this experiment, we investigated the learning-induced reduction of crowding in normally sighted participants and tested if learning on one optotype (Landolt-C) transfers to another (Tumbling-E) or vice versa. Twenty-three normally sighted participants (18C42 years) trained on a crowding task in the right-upper quadrant (target at 6.5 degrees eccentricity) over four sessions. Half of the participants had the four-alternative forced-choice task to discriminate the orientation of a Landolt-C, the other half of participants had the task to discriminate the orientation of a Tumbling-E, each flanked by distractors. In the fifth session, all participants switched to the other untrained optotype, respectively. Learning success was measured as reduction of the spatial extent of crowding. We found an overall significant and comparable learning-induced reduction of crowding in both conditions (Landolt-C and Tumbling-E). However, only in the group who trained on the Landolt-C task did learning effects transfer to the other optotype. The specific target-flanker-constellations may modulate the transfer effects found here. Perceptual learning of a crowding task with optotypes could be a promising tool in rehabilitation programs to help improve peripheral vision (e.g. in patients with central vision loss), but the dependence of possible transfer effects on the optotype and distractors used requires further clarification.","output":"Perceptual learning of a crowding task: Effects of anisotropy and optotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The volume of nucleic acid sequence data has exploded in recent years, and with it, the challenge of finding and transforming relevant data into meaningful information. Processing the abundance of data can require a dynamic ecosystem of customized tools. As analysis pipelines become more complex, there is an increased difficulty in communicating analysis details in a way that is understandable yet of sufficient detail to make informed decisions about results or repeat the analysis. This may be of particular interest to institutions and private companies that need to communicate complex computations in a regulatory environment. To meet this need for standard reporting, the open source BioCompute framework was developed as a standardized mechanism for communicating the details of an analysis in a concise and organized way, and other tools and interfaces were subsequently developed according to the standard. The goal of BioCompute is to streamline the process of communicating computational analyses. Reports that conform to the BioCompute standard are called BioCompute Objects (BCOs). Here, a comprehensive suite of BCOs is presented, representing interconnected elements of a computation that is modeled after those that might be found in a regulatory submission, but which can be shared publicly. Because BCOs are human and machine readable, they can be displayed in customized ways to further improve their utility, and an example of a collapsible format is shown. The work presented here serves as a real world implementation that imitates actual submissions, providing concrete examples. As an example, a pipeline designed to identify viral contaminants in biological manufacturing, such as for vaccines, is developed and rigorously tested to establish a rate of false positive detection, and is described in a BCO report. That pipeline relies on a specially curated database for alignment, and a set of synthetic reads for testing, both of which are also descriptively packaged in their own BCOs. All of the sufficiently complex processes associated with this analysis are therefore represented as BCOs that can be cross-referenced, demonstrating the modularity of BCOs, their ability to organize tremendous complexity, and their use in a lifelike regulatory environment.","output":"BioCompute Objects to communicate a viral detection pipeline with potential for use in a regulatory environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing accessibility.

The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed via an online survey conducted from March 27, 2020 to April 26, 2020. The 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional version (MISS-HP) was administered along with measures of clinician mental health and burnout. A total of 3,006 physicians and nurses who completed the questionnaire were included in the final analysis. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the associations, including that between COVID-19 patient exposure and the risk of moral injury. Results: MISS-HP scores strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms. The estimated prevalence of MI in the total sample was 41.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [39.3%, 43.0%]. HCPs providing medical care to COVID-19 patients experienced a 28% greater risk of MI than those providing medical care to patients without the coronavirus (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56], p = .01). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HCPs in mainland China are at risk for significant MI symptoms as well as mental health problems and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. MI symptoms are strongly correlated with higher clinician burnout, greater psychological distress, and lower level of subjective well-being.

The study involved 189 children with an average age of 8.3  0.7 years (aged 7-10). The tests included an interview, clinical examination (measurement of body weight and height, assessment of the course of the spinous processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, assessment of the location of selected anatomical landmarks of the torso), and a physical examination in which the shape of the spine surface was examined with the use of the photogrammetric method and the moir effect projection. Body balance disturbance tolerance skills (BBDTS) were measured with the rotational test (RT). In the rotational test, the results of body balance disturbance tolerance skills show a slight but statistically significant correlation with the bodyweight of the examined children (Rs = 0.35, p < 0.001). This relationship was also statistically significant in the groups by gender. Among the measured indicators of the curvature of the spine in the sagittal plane, the correlation with the RT test result was mostly related to the  angle and the value was Rs = 0.15 (p = 0.04). In the group of girls, this correlation was stronger and amounted to Rs = 0.26 (p = 0.015). Among other measured correlations, the dependence of variables such as the bodyweight of the subjects and the  angle was shown. In conclusion, increasing lumbar lordosis results in the deterioration of balance disturbance tolerance skills.

For rumors that are advantageous or harmful to the population (positive or negative impact), we show the existence of distinct scenarios that depend on the value of searching for truthful information. We fully discuss which evolutionarily stable information (ESI) search strategies and which optimal information (OI) search strategies eradicate (or not) the rumor and the corresponding expected payoffs.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 289 (76%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have a history of asthma (p=0.009), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.0007) than uninfected children. Children ages 6C13 years were frequently asymptomatic (38%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (30% vs. 49%; p=0.008) or adolescents (30% vs. 59%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6C13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p=0.002), gastrointestinal (26% vs. 9%; p=0.003), and sensory symptoms (43% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.004]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while a history of asthma is associated with decreased risk.

A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less. When expressed as world population coverage (i.e., weighted by population size), global coverage of the final HPV dose for 2019 is estimated at 15%. There is a long way to go to meet the 2030 elimination target of 90%. In the post-COVID era attention should be paid to maintain the pace of introductions, specially ensuring the most populous countries introduce, and further improving program performance globally.","output":"HPV vaccination introduction worldwide and WHO and UNICEF estimates of national HPV immunization coverage 2010-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT IMPACT: By identifying clear gaps in our knowledge of racial and ethnic disparities in antibiotic-resistant infections, this research is informing the design of (a) community-based interventions and (b) patient-centered research studies that we are currently leading to address these disparities and improve human health. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Antibiotic resistance (AR) is widely considered to be the next global pandemic. As with COVID-19, the potential for AR to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities is a major concern. Our goal was to identify gaps in knowledge of AR disparities in order to inform the types of interventions that might be most appropriate to address this. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We reviewed the literature to examine evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in (a) infections with the most concerning drug-resistant bacteria in the United States, and (b) underlying social-economic or behavioral factors that could contribute to such infections. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies published in English between August 1973 - August 2020. We used keywords that included: antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-resistant infections, antibiotic-seeking behavior, prescription/non-prescription antibiotic use, antibiotic education, or health literacy AND race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. We screened all abstracts to identify US-based studies that assessed (a) or (b) above. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We identified 11 studies investigating racial/ethnic disparities for 5 of the 17 drug-resistant bacteria flagged in the CDCs 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report. Black, Hispanic, and lower-income individuals were found to be at higher risk of some community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections. We identified multiple factors that may contribute to disparities in AR-related morbidity and mortality, including reported differences in antibiotic use, higher likelihood of living in crowded/multigenerational homes, more frequent employment in potentially high exposure settings (e.g. slaughterhouses), lower health literacy, and more frequent underlying comorbidities, which increases risks for hospitalization and subsequent acquisition of drug-resistant infections. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Given the small number of studies on this topic, educational interventions that aim to raise awareness of this issue must target not only the public but also researchers. Community-based interventions that seek to address disparities in antibiotic resistance literacy among minority and underserved groups could be particularly impactful.","output":"17157 Racial/ethnic disparities in antibiotic-resistant infections: Knowledge gaps and opportunities for educational interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease, Covid19, pandemic has a great effect on human heath worldwide since it was first detected in late 2019.

UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways. Additionally, UPR induces autophagy (UPR-autophagy pathways). On the other hand, it has become clear that some positive-single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy. Some groups have used the siRNA silencing approach to show that autophagy is required for HCV RNA replication. However, the mechanism of induction of the UPR-autophagy pathways remain unclear in the cells with HCV. Method and results: we used a genome-length HCV RNA (strain O of genotype 1b) replication system (OR6) in hepatoma cells (HuH-7-derived OR6 cells). As control, we used OR6c cells from which the HCV genome had been removed by treatment with interferon-. The UPR-autophagy pathways were activated to a greater degree in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Rapamycin, mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, activated HCV replication in the OR6 cells. On the other hand, HCV replication in the cells was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. Salubrinal (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2(eIF2)-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor) inhibited HCV replication and autophagy. Additionally, HCV replication and autophagy were inhibited more strongly by combination of these inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that UPR-autophagy pathways exert an influence on HCV replication. Therefore, control these pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against replication of HCV.","output":"Unfolded protein response pathways regulate Hepatitis C virus replication via modulation of autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the hematologic therapy procedures, stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents the most extensive and invasive intervention.

For structures like lipopolysaccharide, capsule and peptidoglycan, that function outside of the cytoplasm, their acylation during export or post-synthesis requires transport of an activated acyl group across the membrane. In bacteria this function is most commonly linked to a family of integral membrane proteins - acyltransferase-3 (AT3). Numerous studies examining production of diverse extracytoplasmic sugar-containing structures have identified roles for these proteins in O-acylation. Many of the phenotypes conferred by the action of AT3 proteins influence host colonisation and environmental survival, as well as controlling the properties of biotechnologically important polysaccharides and the modification of antibiotics and antitumour drugs by Actinobacteria. Herein we present the first systematic review, to our knowledge, of the functions of bacterial AT3 proteins, revealing an important protein family involved in a plethora of systems of importance to bacterial function that is still relatively poorly understood at the mechanistic level. By defining and comparing this set of functions we draw out common themes in the structure and mechanism of this fascinating family of membrane-bound enzymes, which, due to their role in host colonisation in many pathogens, could offer novel targets for the development of antimicrobials.","output":"Diverse functions for acyltransferase-3 proteins in the modification of bacterial cell surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid increase in clinical cases of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, suggests high transmissibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service.

Methods We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results A total of 103 studies with 5,673 patients were included. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.15-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88).

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews in 3 cystic fibrosis referral centres in Paris, France. The study included 42 patients with cystic fibrosis: 24 who refused the vaccine and 18 who were vaccinated. The two groups differed quite substantially in their perceptions of vaccine- and disease-related risks. Those who refused the vaccine were motivated mainly by the fears it aroused and did not explicitly consider the 2009 A/H1N1 flu a potentially severe disease. People who were vaccinated explained their choice, first and foremost, as intended to prevent the flu's potential consequences on respiratory cystic fibrosis disease. Moreover, they considered vaccination to be an indirect collective prevention tool. Patients who refused the vaccine mentioned multiple, contradictory information sources and did not appear to consider the recommendation of their local health care provider as predominant. On the contrary, those who were vaccinated stated that they had based their decision solely on the clear and unequivocal advice of their health care provider. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results of our survey led us to formulate three main recommendations for improving adhesion to new pandemic vaccines.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19. METHODS: Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS: Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.","output":"Lack of Serologic Evidence of Infection Among Health Care Personnel and Other Contacts of First 2 Confirmed Patients With COVID-19 in Illinois, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the work, author's presents a very significant and important issues related to the health of mankind's.

All patients underwent LUS on admission to the ward. LUS characteristics have been analyzed. Uni- and multivariate analyses to evaluate predictors for in-hospital death were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven hospitalized elderly patients (19 men) with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled. The median age was 82 years (interquartile range 74.5C93.5). Ultrasound alterations were found in all patients enrolled; inhomogeneous interstitial syndrome with spared areas (91.9%) and pleural alterations (100%) were the most frequent findings. At univariate analysis, LUS score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.168, 95% CI 1.049C1.301) and pleural effusions (HR 3.995, 95% CI 1.056C15.110) were associated with in-hospital death. At multivariate analysis, only LUS score (HR 1.168, 95% CI 1.049C1.301) was independelty associated with in-hospital death. The LUS score's best cutoff for distinguishing patients experiencing in-hospital death was 17 (at multivariate analysis LUS score 17, HR 4.827, 95% CI 1.452C16.040). In-hospital death was significantly different according to the LUS score cutoff of 17 (p = 0.0046). CONCLUSION: LUS could play a role in the diagnosis and prognosis in elderly patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Clinical Role of Lung Ultrasound for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Coronavirus Disease Pneumonia in Elderly Patients: A Pivotal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global spread of COVID-19 not only exerted an enormous impact on the public in different countries but also aggravated depression among youths. The aggressive tendencies of depressed individuals can harm their body and life and threaten those of others. The aggressive and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors of depressed youths may seriously affect their physical and psychological health if not identified and mediated promptly. METHOD: A total of 875 young respondents (including college students, community youths, migrant workers, and so on) from three provinces in China were surveyed in 2020 using a depression scale, non-suicidal self-injury scale, aggression scale, and resilience scale. RESULTS: Depression, non-suicidal self-injury, and aggression are significantly higher among the members of the depression group compared with the members of the healthy control group (P<0.001), and the resilience of the members of the former group is remarkably lower than that of the members of the latter group (P<0.001). Aggression among the depressed youths exhibits a significant positive correlation with non-suicidal self-injury (r= 0.43, P<0.01), whereas aggression (r= C0.18, P<0.05) and non-suicidal self-injury (r= C0.20, P<0.05) demonstrates significant negative correlations with resilience. The resilience of the youths in the depression group plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between aggression and non-suicidal self-injury. CONCLUSION: The more aggressive the behaviors of the depressed youths, the more serious their non-suicidal self-injurious symptoms. Furthermore, resilience plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between aggression and non-suicidal self-injury.","output":"Aggression and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury among Depressed Youths: The Mediating Effect of Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has spread quickly across the globe in late 2019 and this has continued into 2020, causing a complete closure of daily routines, depleting global resources and, in extreme cases, causing loss of life. In Africa, with its hot climate, decision makers try to get people to their work as health care professionals or sometimes access health care facilities. For the peak four months; April, May, June, and July, the virus appeared, spread, and began to decrease. This study aims at analyzing the direct impact of Covid-19 in Africa according to the available data until July 2020. It provides statistics and policies prepared by African countries for this pandemic with the aid of other developed countries' experiences. From studying such applicable policies, it can be seen in a number of cases that lockdown restrictions, school and workplace closures, and limitations to the internal movement have the chief effect of reducing virus spread. Change in travel behavior and number of visitors appear in response to such a crisis. Regarding the potential economic repercussions in the studied period, GDP shows a sharp drop of 3.4%, appearing as a reduction of 6% on the price of oil, reducing the number of tourists by 46%, and causing fluctuations in currency.

Respiratory failure and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are primary drivers of mortality in COVID-19. Currently, therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 and prevent development of ARDS are limited. To address this issue, we will examine the role of deubiquitinases (DUBs), key enzymes that remove ubiquitin from proteins, in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Ubiquitination marks proteins for degradation or modulates function. The role of DUBs in ARDS, and specifically SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, has not been examined. Our hypothesis is that DUBs play a central role in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS pathogenesis, through regulation of host innate immune responses and specific targeting of ACE2, a membrane protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. To facilitate these studies, we have established a biorepository containing human samples from COVID-19+ patients with and without ARDS. We have performed RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples and note differential expression of several putative DUB targets that may drive ARDS pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that ACE2 is ubiquitinated and identify key amino acids that regulate ubiquitination. Finally, we establish a novel interaction between a DUB protein and ACE2. These studies investigate novel mechanisms of ARDS pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ultimately, we aim to identify potential targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection and for future novel coronaviridae.","output":"Deubiquitinases Modulate ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been the gold standard technique for cholecystectomy and has proven more effective than the conventional open technique. The laparoscopic technique utilizes surgical clips for cystic duct occlusion, which come with their own set of complications. With the advent of new vessel and duct sealing technology, alternative energy instruments have been explored for the occlusion of the cystic duct without the use of clips. The Harmonic(?) scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) has become one of the more widely used instruments. In this retrospective study, 208 patients received surgical clip placement or the Harmonic scalpel was used for cystic duct occlusion. The postoperative complications were documented, and rates were calculated for outpatient follow-up, for re-admission, and specifically for the complications of a bile leak. When adjusted for the cause of bile leak (cystic duct versus common bile duct versus accessory duct), the use of the Harmonic scalpel versus clip placement had comparable rates of bile leak at 1.75% and 0.66%, respectively. The use of the Harmonic scalpel is deemed safe and comparable to clip placement at the discretion of the surgeon for cystic duct ligation. Further research with larger homogeneous studies and assessments of cost-effectiveness would further enhance the increasing use of the Harmonic scalpel in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","output":"Clipless versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is affecting public health systems and mental health significantly. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are witnessing vigorous organizational changes in inflammatory bowel disease centers and experiencing all psychosocial effects of the crisis. We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study in order to assess inflammatory bowel disease patients' concerns, behavior, and satisfaction with provided healthcare during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. METHODS: All inflammatory bowel disease patients treated in our center from April 1 to June 1, 2020, were invited to fulfill an anonymous online questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 132 participants have completed the questionnaire, 63.2% were female, 57.9% had Crohn's disease (CD) During the first wave of the pandemic, 74.2% of participants perceived themselves as a high-risk group for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 only because they suffered from inflammatory bowel disease, and 66.2% thought inflammatory bowel disease medications make them more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019. This especially concerned patients treated with biologics (B = 2.068, P < .01). Females were more stressed (B = -1.451, P < .01) and concerned (B = -1.488, P < .01) about the pandemic, and they also reported more potential benefits from professional psychological help (B = -2.664, P = .02). Six patients (5.3%) discontinued inflammatory bowel disease therapy on their own initiative. Seventy-eight (68.4%) patients were completely satisfied and 14 (12.3%) were partially satisfied with the quality of healthcare provided in our inflammatory bowel disease center. CONCLUSION: Female inflammatory bowel disease patients tend to be more emotionally vulnerable during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. Although psychological support should be continuously available to all inflammatory bowel disease patients, female gender may warrant special attention. Providing patients with adequate and early information during pandemic probably leads to better compliance and higher satisfaction.","output":"IBD Patients' Perception of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic and Satisfaction with Provided Healthcare: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020.

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment.

However, whether corticosteroids can prevent respiratory worsening in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without oxygen requirements is currently unknown. AIMS: To assess the efficacy of methylprednisolone pulses (MPP) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with increased levels of inflammatory markers not requiring oxygen at baseline. METHODS: Multicenter, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Spain. Patients admitted for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with raised inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein >60 mg/L, interleukin-6 >40 pg/ml, or ferritin >1,000 g/L) but without respiratory failure after the first week of symptom onset were randomized to receive a 3-day course of intravenous MPP (120 mg/day) or placebo. The primary outcome was treatment failure at 14 days, a composite variable including mortality, the need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, and clinical worsening, this last parameter defined as a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio below 300; or a 15% decrease in the PaO(2) from baseline, together with an increase in inflammatory markers or radiological progression. If clinical worsening occurred, patients received tocilizumab and unmasked corticosteroids. The secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, adverse events, need for ICU admission or high-flow oxygen, length of hospital stay, SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and changes in laboratory parameters. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were randomized and 71 patients were analyzed (34 in the MPP group and 37 in the placebo group). Twenty patients presented with treatment failure (29.4 in the MPP group vs. 27.0% in the placebo group, p = 0.82), with no differences regarding the time to treatment failure between groups. There were no cases of death or mechanical ventilation requirements at 14 days post-randomization. The secondary outcomes were similar in MPP and placebo groups.

The key problem of the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red-based dispensers is their malfunctioning due to the interference of sunlight, vehicle sound, etc. when deployed in busy public places. To overcome such limitations, this study introduced a laser-based sensing device to dispense sanitizer in an automated touchless process. METHOD: The dispensing system is based on an Arduino circuit breadboard where an ATmega328p microcontroller was pre-installed. To sense the proximity, a light-dependent resistor (LDR) is used where the laser light is to be blocked after the placement of human hands, hence produced a sharp decrease in the LDR sensor value. Once the LDR sensor value exceeds the lower threshold, the pump is actuated by the microcontroller, and the sanitizer dispenses through the nozzle. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A novel design and subsequent fabrication of a low-cost, touchless, automated sanitizer dispenser to be used in public places, was demonstrated. The overall performance of the manufactured device was analyzed based on the cost and power consumption, and environmental factors by deploying it in busy public places as well as in indoor environment in major cities in Bangladesh, and found to be more efficient and cost-effective compared to other dispensers available in the market. A comprehensive discussion on this unique design compared to the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red based dispensers, is presented to show its suitability over the commercial ones. The guidelines of the World Health Organization are followed for the preparation of sanitizer liquid. A clear demonstration of the circuitry connections is presented herein, which facilitates the interested individual to manufacture a cost-effective dispenser device in a relatively short time and use it accordingly.

The overall percent protein sequence identity from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from the NCBI database was 99.68%. The functional domains of the S protein reveal that the S1 subunit was highly conserved (99.70%) than the S2 subunit (99.66%). Further, the 319C541 residues (RBD) of amino acids within the S1 domain were 100% similar among the spike protein.

Caregivers were given a 21-item review checklist to assess barriers and facilitators associated with reviewing CtP with an SCN. Following the 21-item review checklist, semistructured telephone interviews, which included 18 open-ended questions, focused on the facilitators of and barriers to CtP implementation and recommendations for future implementation. RESULTS: Quantitative results suggested that 85% (17/20) of caregivers indicated that CtP was helpful and 90% (18/20) would recommend CtP to someone in a similar situation. The qualitative analysis identified 4 themes regarding facilitators of and barriers to implementation: caregiver factors, SCN factors, CtP tool system factors, and recommendations and resources factors. CONCLUSIONS: CtP was found to be not only feasible but also a valuable tool for caregivers seeking resources for themselves and their people living with dementia. Long-term evaluation findings aim to generate results on how CtP can be integrated into care plans for caregivers and how SCNs can provide additional support for caregivers of people living with dementia over an extended period.","output":"Delivering Personalized Recommendations to Support Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obesity is successfully treated by bariatric operations, but some patients need reoperations. No large national studies are available to evaluate the safety and efficacy after reoperative bariatric surgery. METHODS Data from June 2007 through March 2012 from the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database were queried for safety and efficacy of reoperations and compared to those who had initial bariatric operations but did not undergo reoperations. Reoperations were subdivided into corrective operations and conversions. RESULTS Out of 449,753 bariatric operations, 28,720 (6.3%) underwent reoperations of which 19,970 (69.5%) were corrective and 8,750 (30.5%) were conversions. The conversion group compared to primary operations was older (47.63  10.8 vs. 45.5  11.8 years), had less males (13.5 vs. 21.3%), and had more African Americans (14.6 vs. 12%). Comparing primary operations to corrective and conversions operations, respectively, the following were observed: length of stay (1.78  4.95 vs. 2.04  6.44 and 2.86  4.58 days), severe adverse events at 30 days (1.6 vs. 1.7 and 3.3%), severe adverse events at 1 year (2.15 vs. 1.9 and 3.61%), percent excess weight loss at 1 year (43.2 vs. 35.9  92.4 and 39.3  39.9%), 30-day mortality rate (0.1 vs. 0.12 and 0.21%), and 1-year mortality rate (0.17 vs. 0.24 and 0.31%).

The pandemic has raised the question of why countries belonging to similar public health regimes, coordinated through the same global system, responded differently to the same threat. Comparing the responses of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, countries with similar public health regimes, the paper investigates to what degree national differences in COVID-19 policy response reflect significant differences in the policy preferences of national expert groups. RESULTS: We employ a structured case comparison of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to analyze their politico-administrative pandemic preparedness systems and policy responses during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use the results of an interdisciplinary expert survey completed in 2020 to analyze expert perceptions in two ways. First, we analyze expert perceptions of COVID-19 responses while controlling for national COVID-19 trajectories and experts characteristics. Second, we analyze the distribution and effect of dominant global expert-held ideas across countries, showing the importance of dominant ideas for experts perceptions and preferences for COVID-19 response. CONCLUSION: The study finds no evidence indicating that COVID-19 policy variation between the most similar cases of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are the result of differences in the policy preferences of national expert groups. Instead, our study highlights the importance of other factors than cross-national expert dissensus for explaining variation in pandemic response such as the politico-administrative organization of pandemic preparedness systems. Further, we find that expert support for dominant ideas such as a focused protection strategy is associated with consistent policy preferences across locational, disciplinary, and geographic affiliations. Recognition of the latter should be a part of future discussions about how global ideas of pandemic preparedness are diffused transnationally and embedded in national politico-administrative systems.

SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science for published studies without time or language restrictions; Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry and Chinese Clinical Trials Registry for trials registered after 2015; MedRxiv for preprints within the last 12 months. CONTENT: Study eligibility criteria were interventional and prospective observational studies (with or without a control group). Participants were adults and children with a confirmed viral infection. Interventions included the use of CQ or HCQ as antiviral agent in one or more groups of the study. Two authors independently screened abstracts, and all authors agreed on eligible studies. A meta-analysis was planned if studies were available which were similar in terms of participants, intervention, comparator and outcomes. Nineteen studies (including two preprints) were eligible (HIV 8, HCV 2, dengue 2, chikungunya 1, COVID-19 6). Nine and ten studies assessed CQ and HCQ respectively. Benefits of either drug for viral load suppression in HIV are inconsistent. CQ is ineffective in curing dengue (high-certainty evidence) and may have little or no benefit in curing chikungunya (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for COVID-19 infection is rapidly evolving but at this stage we are unsure whether either CQ or HCQ has any benefit in clearing viraemia (very-low-certainty evidence). IMPLICATIONS: Using HCQ or CQ for HIV/HCV infections is now clinically irrelevant as other effective antivirals are available for viral load suppression (HIV) and cure (HCV). There is no benefit of CQ in dengue, and the same conclusion is likely for chikungunya.

The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. OBSERVATIONS: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient.

Teleophthalmological services, such as video consultation or medical telephone advice could, at least partially, compensate for the lack of necessary controls in the case of chronic diseases; however, teleophthalmological options are currently still significantly underrepresented in Germany. OBJECTIVE: In order to determine the willingness of patients to use telemedicine and the virtual clinic, we conducted a survey using a questionnaire on the subject of teleophthalmology in university medicine patients with known glaucoma as a chronic disease during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of100 patients were interviewed. The questionnaire contained 22 questions with multiple choice possible answers. The inclusion criterion was the presence of glaucoma as a chronic disease, age over 18 years, and sufficient linguistic understanding to answer the questions. The data were collected, analyzed and anonymously evaluated. RESULTS: In the patient survey it could be shown that the respondents with glaucoma are very willing to do teleophthalmology and that this would be utilized. Of the patients surveyed 74.0% would accept telemedicine and virtual clinics. Of the ophthalmological patients surveyed 54.0% stated that their visit to the doctor/clinic could not take place due to SARS-CoV?2 and 17.0% of the patients stated that the SARS-CoV?2 pandemic had changed their opinion of telemedicine. DISCUSSION: The acceptance of telemedicine in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma seems surprisingly high. This has been increased even further by the SARS-CoV?2 pandemic. These results reflect a general willingness of patients with chronic eye disease but do not reflect the applicability and acceptance and applicability from a medical point of view; however, this form of virtual consultation is accepted by the majority of patients with glaucoma and could be considered for certain clinical pictures.","output":"Einstellung von Patienten zu m?glicher Telemedizin in der Ophthalmologie: Erhebung mittels Fragebogen bei Glaukompatienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in parturient women, their partners, and their newborns and the association of such antibodies with obstetric and neonatal outcomes.

Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The current urticaria guideline describes the evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of CU. In addition, however, questions often arise in everyday practice that are not addressed by the guideline. METHODS: In May 2020, a digital meeting with German urticaria experts was held, in which practical aspects of CU treatment were discussed and supporting aids for everyday clinical treatment formulated. The resulting advice in this document focus on practical questions and the available literature and experiences of the participants. RESULTS: The diagnosis of CU can be made in a short time by means of a thorough anamnesis, a physical examination, and a basic laboratory chemical diagnosis. For this purpose, practical recommendations for everyday practice are given in this paper. An extended diagnosis is only indicated in a few cases and should always be carried out in parallel with an effective therapy. In general, CU should always be treated in the same way, regardless of whether wheals, angioedema or both occur. Symptomatic therapy should be carried out according to the treatment steps recommended by the guidelines. This publication provides practical advice on issues in everyday practice, such as the procedure in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the cardiac risk under higher dosed H1 antihistamines, the self-administration of omalizumab as well as vaccination under omalizumab therapy. In addition to treatment recommendations, topics such as documentation in the practice and family planning with urticaria will be discussed.

To date, the causal link between ChLL and SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been unequivocally established. METHODS: In this case series, we present demographic, clinical, laboratory, and histopathological information regarding 27 young patients with a clinical diagnosis of ChLL who referred to the Dermatology Unit of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy, from 1 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. RESULTS: The mean age was 14.2 years, and 21 patients (78%) experienced mild systemic symptoms a median of 28 days before the onset of cutaneous lesions. ChLL mostly involved the feet (20 patients - 74%). Among acral lesions, we identified three different clinical patterns: (i) chilblains in 20 patients (74%); (ii) fixed erythematous macules in 4 children (15%); (iii) erythrocyanosis in 3 female patients (11%). Blood examinations and viral serologies, including parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and coxsackievirus were normal in all. Three patients (11%) underwent nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 showing only 1 positive. Histopathological examinations of 7 skin biopsies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of chilblains; vessel thrombi were observed only in 1 case. Our findings failed to demonstrate the direct presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies, both with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH). LIMITATIONS: Limited number of cases, unavailability of laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 in all patients, potential methodological weakness, and latency of skin biopsies in comparison to cutaneous lesions onset. CONCLUSIONS: These observations may support the hypothesis of an inflammatory pathogenesis rather than the presence of peripheral viral particles. Although, we could not exclude an early phase of viral endothelial damage followed by an IFN-I or complement-mediated inflammatory phase. Further observations on a large number of patients are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","output":"RNAscope in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in chilblain-like lesions: A clinical, laboratory and histopathological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coordination of primary care is essential to improving care delivery within health systems, especially for older adults with increased health/social needs.

Here, we investigated the presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in dromedary camels that were Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) seropositive but MERS-CoV free. The tested 229 dromedaries had anti-MERS-CoV camel antibodies with variable cross-reactivity patterns against SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the S trimer and M, N, and E proteins. Using SARS-CoV-2 competitive immunofluorescence immunoassays and pseudovirus neutralization assays, we found medium-to-high titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in these animals. Through linear B cell epitope mapping using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing and a SARS-CoV-2 peptide/proteome microarray, we identified a large repertoire of Betacoronavirus cross-reactive antibody specificities in these dromedaries and demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2-specific VHH antibody repertoire is qualitatively diverse. This analysis revealed not only several SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are highly immunogenic in humans, including a neutralizing epitope, but also epitopes exclusively targeted by camel antibodies. The identified SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralizing camel antibodies are not proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Rather, their presence in nonimmunized camels supports the development of SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune camels, which could be a prominent source of therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Dromedary camels as a natural source of neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers the problem of joint change detection and identification assuming multiple composite post-change hypotheses.

These kirana stores have been the lifeline of consumers across India during the Covid-19 outbreak which saw the closure of most of the other retail formats. While Covid-19 developed a new affiliation for kirana stores among consumers and provided new possibilities for these stores to expand their customer bases and product range, at the same time highlighted the gaps in their supply chain management. This paper would examine the role and assistance which technologies like digital and blockchain technologies can provide to these unorganized small-scale neighborhood kirana stores. Design/Methodology/Approach The methodology adopted in this study is the interpretivism approach of research. All the interpretations are drawn with the content analysis of relevant research, case studies, and industry reports. Findings Blockchain and digital technologies hold tremendous potential to transform retail omni-supply chains. Although blockchain is a nascent technology, it has huge potential to integrate back-end operations for the supply chain for these stores. However, RFID and other digital technologies have established evidence to manage and improve front-end operation for supply chain management at these stores. Research Limitations/Implications The limitation will arise in this study with the nonavailability of primary data and direct interaction with the people involved in the process. Sometimes the method used in the findings of the study may become the limitation when discussed by other researchers with a different method.

While vaccination is an important intervention, its roll-out is slow and unequal across the globe. Therefore, extensive testing still remains one of the key methods to monitor and contain the virus. Testing on a large scale is expensive and arduous. Hence, we need alternate methods to estimate the number of cases. Online surveys have been shown to be an effective method for data collection amidst the pandemic. In this work, we develop machine learning models to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 using self-reported symptoms. Our best model predicts the daily cases with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 226.30 (normalized MAE of 27.09%) per state, which demonstrates the possibility of predicting the actual number of confirmed cases by utilizing self-reported symptoms. The models are developed at two levels of data granularity - local models, which are trained at the state level, and a single global model which is trained on the combined data aggregated across all states. Our results indicate a lower error on the local models as opposed to the global model. In addition, we also show that the most important symptoms (features) vary considerably from state to state. This work demonstrates that the models developed on crowd-sourced data, curated via online platforms, can complement the existing epidemiological surveillance infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.

Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs.

However, findings have been inconsistent, and studies often examine single time-point bias during threat exposure, instead of across time. Attention to threat may shift throughout exposure (e.g., from initial engagement to avoidance), and research suggests that threat intensity and state anxiety influence attentional biases. No studies to our knowledge have examined biases across time and with varying threat intensity and state anxiety. Participants with GAD (n=38) and non-anxious controls (n=25) viewed emotional (high threat, mild threat, and positive) and neutral image pairs under calm and anxious mood states while their eye movements were tracked. Participants showed an initial orientation to emotional images, and, under the anxious mood induction, demonstrated a bias towards threatening images at first fixation and over time. Results suggest it may be normative to attend to threat cues over other stimuli while in an anxious state. Individuals with GAD uniquely showed a bias away from mild (but not high) threat images over time relative to controls. Implications for theories of attentional biases to threat and clinical implications for GAD and anxiety disorders broadly are discussed.","output":"Avoidance of mild threat observed in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using eye tracking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. In mice, optimal protection to VRTI is mediated by recruitment of effector T cells to the lungs and respiratory tract, and subsequent establishment of tissue resident memory T cells (Trm), which provide long-term protection. These critical processes of T cell recruitment to the respiratory tract, their role in disease pathogenesis, and establishment of local protective immunity remain undefined in pediatric VRTI. In this study, we investigated T cell responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of infants and young children with VRTI, revealing developmental regulation of T cell differentiation and Trm generation in situ. We show a direct concurrence between T cell responses in the URT and LRT, including a preponderance of effector CD8+ T cells that was associated with disease severity. During infant VRTI, there was an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector cells (effector memory RA+ T cells) in the URT and LRT with reduced Trm in the early neonatal period, and decreased effector memory RA+ T cell and increased Trm formation with age during the early years of childhood. Moreover, human infant T cells exhibit increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet compared with adult T cells, suggesting a mechanism for preferential generation of effector over Trm. The developmental regulation of respiratory T cell responses as revealed in the present study is important for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating VRTI in the critical early life stages.","output":"Developmental Regulation of Effector and Resident Memory T Cell Generation during Pediatric Viral Respiratory Tract Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: El mundo vive una situacin excepcional por el avance de la pandemia producida por el coronavirus 2 del sndrome respiratorio agudo grave y la indita medida de aislamiento social preventivo y obligatorio utilizada por varios pases.

A flushometer type toilet was seeded with a viral solution of 10(5) and 10(6) PFU mL(-1) of MNV and then flushed. Upon flushing, two bioaerosol samplers were activated to collect aerosolized MNV. Prior to the experiment, two optical particle counters monitored particle size and number distribution of aerosol produced from flushing a toilet across height, position, and side. The location with the highest mean particle concentration, was behind the toilet and 0.15 m above the toilet bowl rim, which is where bioaerosol sampling occurred.

Understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifestation, progression, and management is crucial for the healthcare personnel caring for COVID-19 patients within the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as for the patients' health progression. Methods A prospective observational study was used to investigate the progression of critically ill COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to the ICU of Nicosia General Hospital from March 10 to May 1, 2020. All patients over the age of 18 were included in the study; their data were anonymously collected using the institutions electronic medical record system and analyzed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Pregnant women, children, and prisoners were excluded. Results During the study period, a total of 19 patients with a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in the study; 74% were men and their mean age was 64 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients were obese, 53% had a history of confirmed hypertension, 68% were admitted with severe respiratory failure, and all of them required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were categorized into four groups of ventilation based on the H or L ventilation phenotype in association with co-morbidities. Prone position in the first mechanical ventilation days was found to be more advantageous in L than H phenotype patients, 68% required vasopressor support, and 42% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) during their ICU stay. Diarrhea was with a median day of onset of eight days. Lactate levels above 2 mmol/L in the first four days of admission were correlated with a negative outcome. Nine patients (47%) were successfully discharged from the ICU while 10 (53%) died during their stay. Conclusion In critically ill patients, male gender and obesity are significant risk factors for ICU admission due to COVID-19, and early prone position, mechanical ventilation, and low positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) values may be beneficial, especially in the L phenotype category patients. Patients' ventilation phenotype during ICU admission and hospitalization seemed to determine the outcome.

FastVirus and Luna proved most sensitive. N detection was more reliable than that of RdRP, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we demonstrate that treatment of nasopharyngeal swabs with 70 degrees for 10 or 30 min, or 90 degrees for 10 or 30 min (both original variant and B 1.1.7) inactivates SARS-CoV-2 employing plaque assays, and that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples. These findings make SARS-CoV-2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL-3 facilities.

Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","output":"Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations, course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD). Due to their underlying disease as well due to therapeutic immunosuppression, these patients may be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19 or for a flare of the underlying disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and treatment data from juvenile patients with RMD as well as data about SARS-CoV-2 infection like test date and method, clinical characteristics, disease course, outcome and impact on the disease activity of the RMD were documented on a specific SARS-CoV-2 questionnaire implemented in the National Paediatric Rheumatology Database (NPRD) in Germany. The survey data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: From 17 April 2020 to 16 February 2021, data were collected from 76 patients (52% female) with RMD and laboratory-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with median age of 14 years, diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (58%), autoinflammatory (24%) and connective tissue disease (8%).

In China, comprehensive studies of the etiology of CAP in children aged between 2 months and 14 years who are serious enough to require hospitalization are lacking. Previous studies have been limited in child age range, focused on fatal cases, and/or limited in etiologies sought. An understanding of the etiologies is needed for development of best prevention and management practices. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to prospectively determine during a 12-month period the etiology of CAP in hospitalized children in a center in Northwest China. DESIGN/METHODS A prospective 12-month study (2004-2005) of CAP cases in children who were 2 months to 14 years of age admitted to the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, China. Testing included admission and 1-month postdischarge serum for viral and bacterial serologic analyses (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, paraflu 1-3, adenovirus; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza B, Mycoplasma, and Moraxella. catarrhalis), blood culture, a nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral antigen testing, and a chest radiograph on admission and 1 month postdischarge. The study was funded by Lanzhou University. The study was performed in compliance with the guidelines of the institutional review board of the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. RESULTS CAP was the admitting diagnosis for 29% of all admissions during the 12-month study. Of the 884 CAP cases, 821 (93%) were enrolled and completed the study. The age range was 2 months to 14 years; mean age was 2.3 years; 40% were <1 year. The average length of stay was 9.2 days (range, 6-20) but varied by age and etiology. Fourteen percent had received antibiotics before admission and 14% had underlying illnesses; 12% required intensive care unit treatment and 5 died. A microbial etiology for CAP was identified in 547 (67%); viral 535 (43%), bacterial 228 (27%), mixed viral bacterial 107 (13%), mixed viral in 1%, and mixed bacterial in 1%. The etiology varied by age; respiratory syncytial virus was most common in <1 year, S. pneumoniae and Hib 1-3 years, and Mycoplasma 5 years. Three potentially vaccine preventable etiologies accounted for 35% of the cases: influenza 9%, Hib 12%, and S. pneumonia 14%. CONCLUSIONS CAP is a major cause of childhood admission in China. Given the etiologic findings in this study, potentially 25% to 35% of cases could be prevented if seasonal influenza vaccine and conjugated H. influenza b and conjugated pneumococcal vaccines were introduced into routine practice.","output":"Vaccine preventable community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children in Northwest China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Office of Civil Rights Notification of Enforcement Discretion applies to all HIPAA health care providers, rendering telehealth services under good faith provisions of telehealth during COVID-19 to all telehealth patients until the end of the public health emergency (PHE) Providers who can perform these services in a good faith communication portal include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists (CNAs), clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, registered dietitians, and nutrition professionals Office and other outpatient visits can now be rendered to new or established patients (codes 99201-99215) Since the physical examination cannot be performed, the recommendation from the DHHS is for providers to choose the appropriate level of service based on time or the medical decision-making component of the interaction Requirements to render these CTBS services include obtaining one annual consent for the service and be provided by practitioners who cannot bill separately for evaluation and management (E&M) services, such as licensed clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists (Table 2)","output":"Introduction to Telehealth Coding: Clinical Issues and Solutions/Documentation Guidance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Critical illnesses in the intensive care unit (ICU) have been a global burden.

Here, we explored the putative antiviral effect of the anti-CK2 peptide CIGB-325 on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection using different in vitro viral infected cell-based assays. The impact of the peptide on viral mRNA and protein levels was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Finally, pull-down experiments followed by Western blot and/or mass spectrometry analysis were performed to identify CIGB-325-interacting proteins. We found that CIGB-325 inhibited both the cytopathic effect and the number of plaque-forming units. Accordingly, intracellular viral protein levels were clearly reduced after treatment of BCoV-infected cells, with CIGB-325 determined by immunocytochemistry. Pull-down assay data revealed the physical interaction of CIGB-325 with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein and a group of bona fide CK2 cellular substrates.

Kinetics of beta 2 -integrin activation were different on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (several hours vs. few minutes, respectively), however, m24 antibody readily stained both cell types 4-6 hours after antigen stimulation. With this protocol, we were able to monitor CD4 + and CD8 + virus-specific T cells specific for CMV, EBV, HBV, and SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood or cryopreserved PBMCs of infected or vaccinated individuals. By costaining with m24 and CD154 antibodies, we assessed extremely low frequencies of polyfunctional CD4 + T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides.

We sought to identify antiviral targets through the genome-wide characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins that are crucial for viral pathogenesis and that cause harmful cytopathogenic effects. All 29 viral proteins were tested in a fission yeast cell-based system using inducible gene expression. Twelve proteins, including eight nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14, and NSP15) and four accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b), were identified that altered cellular proliferation and integrity and induced cell death. Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the 12 proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells because it plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and its activities are linked to lung tissue damage and a cytokine storm. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis and caused activation of proinflammatory response with production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IFN-1, possibly through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B). To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, G188. Compared with wild-type ORF3a, the G188 variant yielded more robust activation of cellular oxidative stress, cell death, and innate immune response. Since cellular oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to cell death and tissue damage linked to the severity of COVID-19, our findings suggest that ORF3a is a promising, novel therapeutic target against COVID-19.","output":"Genome-Wide Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Cytopathogenic Proteins in the Search of Antiviral Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic is a world-wide crisis without an effective therapy. While most approaches to therapy are using repurposed drugs that were developed for other diseases, it is thought that targeting the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can result in an effective therapeutic treatment. The coronavirus RNA cap structure is methylated by two viral methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The proper methylation of the virus depends on the level of methionine in the host to form SAM. Herein, we propose to restrict methionine availability by treating the patient with oral recombinant methioninase, aiming to treat Covid-19. By restricting methionine we not only interdict viral replication, which depends on the viral RNA cap methyaltion, but also inhibit the proliferation of the infected cells, which have an increased requirement for methionine. Most importantly, the virally-induced T-cell- and macrophage-mediated cytokine storm, which seems to be a significant cause for Covid-19 deaths, can also be inhibited by restricting methionine, since T-cell and macrophrage activation greatly increases the methionine requirement for these cells.

Underage youth reported e-cigarette deliveries from vape shops and/or dealers or friends who received such deliveries, and 63 of 229 (27.5%) self-reported accessing e-cigarettes without age verification. e-Cigarette users were 52% less likely to quit or reduce their use if they previously used e-cigarettes between 11 and 99 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.78), 68% less likely to quit if they previously used e-cigarettes more than 100 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51), and 51% were less likely to quit if they were nicotine dependent (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.70). Conclusions and Relevance: During the COVID-19 pandemic, youth e-cigarette users reported changes in e-cigarette use, point-of-purchase, and ability to purchase e-cigarettes without age verification. The US Food and Drug Administration and local policy makers may find these data useful to inform policies to prevent e-cigarette sales to underage youth.","output":"Underage Youth and Young Adult e-Cigarette Use and Access Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No Abstract.","output":"Platelets are hyperactivated but show reduced glycoprotein VI reactivity in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic the clinical utility and indications for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing were not clearly defined.

This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team. Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decision-making, were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. 113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot. 44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies. Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g. pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6). We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children.

Health counselling on diet, physical activity, medication adherence, expressed emotions and technology use, by health professionals, can help in managing these side-effects. AIM The aim of this study was to identify the pre-counselling profile of the subjects such as body mass index (BMI), diet, physical activity, medication adherence, expressed emotions and technology use among PwMI; to attend the Holistic Health Clinic as part of follow-up services in the psychiatry Outpatient Department (OPD) as well as to find correlation and association between the study variables. METHODS The study involved a cross-sectional descriptive design based on convenience sampling. The sample consists of 56 patients who are receiving antipsychotics under symptom control (self-reported) and were overweight. Data were collected with a patient assessment proforma and analysed using SPSS-22. RESULTS The patients referred to the holistic health counselling (HHC) had abnormal weight and BMI. The mean and SD of weight was 74.48  14.07 and BMI 29.51  5.15. All the participants received counselling on diet, 87.5% on physical activity, 62.5% on sleep hygiene, 55.4% on medication adherence, 8.9% on family emotional climate and only 5.4% on healthy use of technology. Weight has shown significant relation with gender (male = 80.84  17.71, female = 71.09  10.52, t = -2.52, p = .015) and near to significant relationship (2 = 7.685, p = .053) with educational status. CONCLUSION Patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) have lesser extra pyramidal side-effects; however, they are more prone to gain weight. Proper screening and counselling during the follow-up visit in the outpatient setting can help in identification, prevention and management of the obesity-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and motivate them to adopt healthy behaviours.","output":"Profile of recipients of holistic health counselling in a psychiatric OPD in South India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a public health emergency that is spreading worldwide and seriously affecting the global economy Date on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 remains limited METHODS: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to March 7, 2020, were collected Binary logistic regression model was use to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID-19 illness to critical illness The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 disease were evaluated RESULTS: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID-19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P&lt;0 001;OR: 0 054 95% CI: 0 017-0 173) Among patients with severe COVID-19 aged&lt;65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42 2% vs 90 0%, P=0 000) and the mortality(6 7% vs 30 0%, P=0 002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non-methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non-methylprednisolone group were found among COVID-19 patients older than 65 years Moreover, both the levels of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/ul, P=0 007) and IL-6(241 9 vs 82 8pg/ml, P=0 025) were higher among patients with severe COVID-19 aged&lt;65 years, compared with those patients 65 years old CONCLUSION: Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone have a positive effect for patients with severe COVID-19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness","output":"The Role of Methylprednisolone on Preventing Disease Progression for Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Difficulties in emotional regulation are key to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60C90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the University of New South Wales (HC200199). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Nasal washes underwent multiplex PCR, and the analysis was limited to viral mono-infections. RESULTS: 49% of cases tested positive for at least one virus, of whom 10% had multiple infections. 53% of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), of whom 52% were positive for at least one virus. The most frequent etiologies for mono-infections among FRI cases were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (13%), Influenza B (13%) and coxsackevirus (9%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of ILI for influenza among FRI cases were 72%, 48%, 40% and 69% respectively. On logistic regression, there were marked differences in the prevalence of different symptoms and signs between viruses with fever more prevalent amongst influenza and adenovirus infections than other viruses. CONCLUSION: There are multiple viral etiologies for FRI and ILI with differing clinical symptoms in the Singapore military. Influenza and coxsackevirus were the most common etiology for FRI, while influenza and adenoviruses displayed the most febrile symptoms.

This creates challenges for hospital's efforts to improve the efficiency, quality, and value of care. Experienced inpatient-focused physicians-\\"Physician Advocates\\"-could act as liaisons between private practitioners and the fast-paced inpatient microsystem. METHODS We conducted a controlled pre-post (\\"differences-in-differences\\") analysis at an academic medical center where private-practice physicians care for about 40% of medical inpatients and hospitalist groups care for 60%. In the intervention, \\"Physician Advocates\\" participated in daily multidisciplinary \\"Progression of Care Rounds,\\" offering suggestions to increase care quality for private-practice physicians' patients. Controls were cared for by a large, well-established hospitalist group, which convened separate, unchanged multidisciplinary rounds. Outcomes were length of stay (LOS; primary outcome), 30-day readmissions, and inpatient mortality. RESULTS In a risk-adjusted analysis of 31,632 medical inpatients, LOS declined by 4 hours more from the baseline period to the post-intervention period in the intervention group relative to the control group (ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99, p=0.004). Readmissions declined 22% more in the intervention group (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.97, p=0.023). Mortality was unchanged (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.78-1.93 p-value=0.378). CONCLUSION Among inpatients cared for by private practitioners, adding Physician Advocates to multidisciplinary rounds was associated with improved LOS and reduced readmissions-measures of efficiency and value. The Physician Advocates approach should be tested in diverse health systems because it allows hospitals to leverage the expertise of on-site clinicians while respecting the traditional private-practice care model, in which primary care physicians manage their hospitalized patients.","output":"\\"Physician Advocates\\": a novel strategy for improving the value of hospital care by employing hospitalists part time to support non-hospitalist physicians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionInfection with SARS-CoV-2 is typically compared with influenza to contextualize its health risks. SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with coagulation disturbances including arterial thrombosis, leading to considerable interest in antithrombotic therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the independent thromboembolic risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza remains incompletely understood. We evaluated the adjusted risks of thromboembolic events after a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with influenza in a large retrospective cohort. MethodsWe used a US-based electronic health record (EHR) dataset linked with insurance claims to identify adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020. We identified influenza patients diagnosed between October 1, 2018 and April 31, 2019. Primary outcomes [venous composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT); arterial composite of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI)] and secondary outcomes were assessed 90 days post-diagnosis. Propensity scores (PS) were calculated using demographic, clinical, and medication variables. PS-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. ResultsThere were 417,975 COVID-19 patients (median age 57y, 61% women), and 345,934 influenza patients (median age 47y, 66% women). Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had higher venous thromboembolic risk (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.70), but not arterial thromboembolic risk (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.10). Secondary analyses demonstrated similar risk for ischemic stroke (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98-1.25) and MI (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85-1.03) and higher risk for DVT (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19-1.56) and PE (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.57-2.10) in patients with COVID-19.

This truthful portrait was pointed out by Martha Nussbaum in her book Introduction: Feminism & International Development. Throughout history, gender inequality has been persistent in many aspects of life, including health and empowerment. Unfortunately, this inequality has not been excluded from the field of science. Perpetual assumption that womens absence or restriction to secondary roles in various disciplines is an acceptable law of nature misrepresents womens contribution to science and maintains hurdles for participation in the future. According to a recent UNESCOs report, women make up only 30% of researchers worldwide. But despite all the obstacles, women made major contributions with discoveries that shaped the progress in many scientific fields. In the field of genetics, Rosalind Franklin is an example of unwittingly compromised womens scientific achievements. Franklin was an expert in X-ray crystallography; her data, especially the photo 51, was critical to James Watson and Francis Crick along with their own data to publish the discovery of the double helix DNA structure in 1953. Her contribution was acknowledged posthumously in Watsons memoir in 1968. Barbara McClintock was a 20th century American cytogeneticist who remains up to date the only woman receiving an unshared Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock dedicated her work to cytogenetics and discovered the phenomenon of mobile genes. Her research was initially subjected to skepticism in the 1950s. It was not until the late 1960s that the community realized the significance of McClintocks discovery.

This case series reports on the management of agitation, delirium, and catatonia in COVID-19 patients during and after extubation efforts. We present three cases in which Psychiatry was consulted for agitation in intubated COVID-19 patients. These patients were managed for severe agitation during weaning from extubation as well as for subsequent psychiatric challenges, including catatonia. Patient 1: 26-year-old female with bipolar I with psychotic features who was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia. After an emergency C-section at 31 weeks gestation, she was intubated for 9 days and started on valproate 250 mg BID for agitation. She was extubated successfully and discharged home. Patient 2: 42-year-old female with bipolar I and PTSD who was intubated following COVID-19-related acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She received valproate 250mg BID and was extubated successfully. She became catatonic when home quetiapine was resumed and recovered following quetiapine discontinuation and lorazepam. She was discharged on valproic acid and alprazolam.

Online fresh food shopping provides consumers with an alternative to shopping in a traditional market, while also enabling procurement of such goods at a reduced risk of infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether online fresh food shopping behaviors change during public health emergency periods. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through a web-based survey (508 respondents in China). Descriptive analysis, ordinal logistic regression analysis, and the Apriori algorithm were employed to explore what characteristics influence purchase frequency as well as food and delivery time preferences among different customer groups. Findings: Based on the survey data, this study found that purchase frequency grew 71.2% during the COVID-19 crisis. City type and online shopping frequency of respondents are positively correlated with purchase frequency in normal and COVID-19 crisis periods. Number of daily hours worked by respondents only showed a significant impact for the normal period.

We here investigated the geographical character of the early spread of the infection and correlated it with several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in China, the United States, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The time of the analysis corresponded with the end of the first wave infection in China, namely June 2020. We found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po Valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area. Spain and Germany did not present a noticeable gradient of pollution levels causing non-significant correlations. Densely populated areas were often hotspots of lower air quality levels but were not always correlated with a higher viral incidence. Air pollution has long been recognised as a high risk factor for several respiratory-related diseases and conditions, and it now appears to be a risk factor for COVID-19 as well. As such, air pollution should always be included as a factor for the study of airborne epidemics and further included in public health policies.

It also poses a public health concern when avian influenza subtypes infect humans, often with high mortality. Understanding viral genetic factors which positively contribute to influenza A virus (IAV) fitness C infectivity, spread and pathogenesis C is of great importance both for human and livestock health. PB1-F2 is a small accessory protein encoded by IAV and in mammalian hosts has been implicated in a wide range of functions that contribute to increased pathogenesis. In the avian host, the protein has been understudied despite high-level full-length conservation in avian IAV isolates, which is in contrast to the truncations of the PB1-F2 length frequently found in mammalian host isolates. Here we report that the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein, from a low pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus, prolongs infectious virus shedding from directly inoculated chickens, thereby enhancing transmission of the virus by lengthening the transmission window to contact birds. As well as extending transmission, the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 suppresses pathogenicity evidenced by an increased minimum lethal dose in embryonated chicken eggs and increasing survival in directly infected birds when compared to a virus lacking an ORF for PB1-F2. We propose that there is a positive pressure to maintain a full-length functional PB1-F2 protein upon infection of avian hosts as it contributes to the effective transmission of IAV in the field.","output":"Influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein prolongs viral shedding in chickens lengthening the transmission window"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 outbreak that took place in early 2020, the economic activities in China were drastically reduced and accompanied by a strong reduction in the emission of primary air pollutants.

Materials/Methods: Between April 2020 and July 2020, patients without influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms at four radiation oncology departments (2 academic university hospitals and 2 community hospitals) underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients were tested either prior to radiotherapy simulation or after simulation but prior to treatment initiation. Patients tested for indications of ILI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Management of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was individualized based on disease site and acuity. Results: Over a three-month period, a total of 385 tests were performed in 336 asymptomatic patients either prior to simulation (n=75), post-simulation, prior to treatment (n=230), or on-treatment (n=49). A total of 5 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a pre-treatment prevalence of 1.3% (2.6% in North/Central NJ and 0.4% in Southern NJ/Southeast PA). The median age of positive patients was 58 years (range: 38-78 years). All positive patients were white and were relatively equally distributed with regard to gender (2 male, 3 female) and ethnicity (2 Hispanic and 3 non-Hispanic). The median Charlson comorbidity score among positive patients was 5. All 5 patients were treated for different primary tumor sites, the large majority had advanced disease (80%), and all were treated for curative intent. The majority of positive patients were being treated with either sequential or concurrent immunosuppressive systemic therapy (80%). Initiation of treatment was delayed for 14 days with the addition of re-testing for 4 patients, while one patient was treated without delay but with additional infectious-disease precautions. Conclusion: Broad-based pre-treatment asymptomatic testing of radiation oncology patients for SARS-CoV-2 is of limited value, even in a high-incidence region.

The role of diet in IBD etiopathogenesis, disease control and symptom management remains incompletely understood. Few studies have collected data on the dietary habits of immigrant populations living with IBD. Our aim was to describe the dietary practices and beliefs of British South Asians with IBD. METHODS: A 30-item questionnaire was developed and consecutively administered to 255 British South Asians with IBD attending gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of participants believed diet was the initiating factor for their IBD and 63% felt diet had previously triggered disease relapse. Eighty-nine percent avoided certain dietary items in the belief that this would prevent relapse. The most commonly avoided foods and drinks were spicy and fatty foods, carbonated drinks, milk products, alcohol, coffee, and red meat. A third of patients had tried a whole food exclusion diet, most commonly lactose- or gluten-free, and this was most frequently reported amongst those with clinically active IBD (P = 0.02). Almost 60% of participants avoided eating the same menu as their family, or eating out, at least sometimes, to prevent IBD relapse. CONCLUSIONS: British South Asians with IBD demonstrate significant dietary beliefs and food avoidance behaviors with increased frequency compared to those reported in Caucasian IBD populations.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects and complications of our surgical modality for axillary bromhidrosis. METHODS Sixty-three patients with bromhidrosis were treated. An incision about two-thirds of the length of the widest transverse diameter was made on the axillary crease. The loosened layers between the dermis and axillary superficial fascia containing apocrine glands were carefully undermined with an iris scissor. The entire apocrine glands-axillary superficial fascia complex was dissected from the centre to the superior and inferior margins with an electrosurgical pencil. RESULTS Of the 126 axillae, malodour was eradicated in 112 axillae and reduced sharply in 14. There were three cases of skin necroses. The Dermatology Life Quality Index score decreased significantly and the quality of life improved after the operation. CONCLUSION Our surgical technique can achieve minimal tissue damage and maintain no hematoma postoperatively. The rate of skin necrosis was low.

The structure reveals surface features not present in the prototype HBV/A genotype. HBV/G is novel in that it has a unique 36- bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon. This results in a twelve amino acid insertion at the N-terminal end of the core protein, and two stop codons in the precore region that prevent the expression of HBeAg. HBV/G replication in patients is associated with co-infection with another genotype of HBV, suggesting that HBV/G may have reduced replication efficiency in vivo. We localized the N-terminal insertion in HBV/G and show that it forms two additional masses on the core surface adjacent to each of the dimer-spikes and have modelled the structure of the additional residues within this density. We show that the position of the insertion would not interfere with translocation of nucleic acids through the pores to the core interior compartment. However, the insertion may partially obscure several residues on the core surface that are known to play a role in envelopment and secretion of virions, or that could affect structural rearrangements that may trigger envelopment after DNA second-strand synthesis.","output":"Hepatitis B Virus Genotype G forms core-like particles with unique structural properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Endoscopic sclerotherapy using sodium morrhuate has been used to treat patients with weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass whose presumed etiology is loss of restriction due to gastrojejunostomy dilation.

However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult. It seems to me that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of prognostic factors analyzed all cases of adults hospitalized for severe COVID-19 in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The occurrence of obesity was measured using secondary data from hospital teams surveillance records. The outcome assessed was hospital deaths caused by severe COVID-19. Poisson regression was used to estimate RRs and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 100,099 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, most of whom were White (84.7%) and male (54.7%). The effect of obesity was strongly modified by age, being higher in younger age groups. For the 18C39-year-old age group, RR = 2.54 (95%CI: 2.33C2.77), and in individuals 70 years and above, RR = 1.09 (95%CI: 1.05C1.13).

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate.

Many survivors search for cancer information online, yet there is a dearth of research on how survivors obtain and engage with this information. This study examined cancer survivors information-seeking behaviors and perceptions during a self-guided online search task. METHODS: Ten adult cancer survivors (largely breast and thyroid) completed a task in which they searched for online cancer-related information of their choice. Participants were asked to verbally narrate the procedural aspects of the task and provide real-time responses to the search results and experiences related to the task. Transcripts were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach, and codes and themes were examined and interpreted. RESULTS: Participants searched primarily for information specific to their cancer type and stage, seeking personalized information about risk factors, prognosis, and treatments. Additionally, participants reported having to engage in excessive navigation to find relevant cancer information, citing aesthetic, usability, and credibility features of the websites that they considered barriers to obtaining this information. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors online health information needs require streamlined cancer information resources that are disaggregated by cancer type, stage, and treatment course and located on websites with aesthetic and usability features that facilitate expedient searches for personally relevant cancer information.

This diversity, while a strength, can also foster divergent views about priorities and what constitutes success, thereby posing challenges for management, operations, and evaluation. As a sponsor and partner in such collaborations, we seek to assist and support their development and implementation of sound research strategies, to optimize their efficiency, sustainability, and public health impact. This report describes our efforts using an adaptation of the well-established Kaplan-Norton strategy management paradigm, in our clinical trials setting. We share findings from our first test of the utility and acceptance of this approach for evaluating and managing research strategies in a collaborative clinical research partnership. RESULTS: Findings from pilot studies and our first implementation in an ongoing clinical research partnership in Liberia, provide initial support for our hypothesis that an adapted version of the Kaplan-Norton strategy management model can have use in this setting. With leadership from within the partnership, analysis artifacts were gathered, and assessments made using standardized tools. Practical feasibility, resonance of the findings with partners, and convergence with other empirical assessments lend initial support for the view that this approach holds promise for obtaining meaningful, useable results for assessing and improving clinical research management. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Engaged leadership, thoughtful timing to align with partnership planning cycles, support for the process, and an eye towards the collaboration's long-term goals appear important for developing model understanding and practice. Skepticism about evaluations, and unease at exposing weaknesses, may hinder the effort. Acceptance of findings and associated opportunities for improvement by group leadership, support a growing sense of validity. Next steps aim to test the approach in other partnerships, streamline the methodology for greater ease of use, and seek possible correlations of strategy management assessments with performance evaluation. There is hardly a better example than the COVID-19 pandemic, to spotlight the need for efficient and effective clinical research partnerships to address global health challenges. While heartened by the collaborative spirit driving the effort so far, we cannot let our enthusiasm lull us into thinking that nobility of purpose or an abundance of good will is sufficient. Careful monitoring and adjustment of clinical research strategy in response to changes (e.g., demographics, pathogen evolution, research acceptance, political and cultural environments) are vital to making the needed adjustments that can guide these programs toward successful outcomes.

The response of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of Taiyuan city in the COVID-19 epidemic situation was taken as an example. A new discrete stochastic COVID-19 epidemic spread mathematical model which integrated public health intervention and input cases was proposed. The model was parameterized by multisource data, and the impact of different flow patterns on the risk of secondary outbreak was analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of its emergency system construction were analyzed. Additionally, the improvement measures and suggestions for the existing problems were proposed. Results suggested that there was only one specialized disease prevention and control institution in Taiyuan, and there were only 11 centers for disease prevention and control, accounting for 6.2% (11/177) of the total in Shanxi Province. Through the analysis, it was found that the current public health emergency response system in Taiyuan city had imperfect management coordination mechanism, incomplete plan type, serious shortage of public health personnel, poor information communication efficiency, insufficient early warning efficiency of the epidemic detection system, and weak logistics material security links. Therefore, it was proposed to establish a sound coordination system of emergency health management and vigorously promote the construction of emergency health management institutions. Thus, a public health emergency management system integrating management coordination system, plan system, emergency team building system, material reserve management, and other functions was formed. The application of discrete stochastic mathematical model suggests that intermittent population flow and effective isolation of infected people in transient population can effectively reduce the risk of secondary outbreak. The system analysis here also provides theoretical basis for improving the construction of public health emergency response system in Taiyuan.","output":"Construction of COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control and Public Health Emergency Response System Based on Discrete Stochastic Mathematical Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani mainly influencing the population of tropical and subtropical regions across the globe. The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine.

Whether all populations, including pregnant and lactating individuals, will mount a comparable response to a booster dose is not known. OBJECTIVEWe sought to profile the humoral immune response to a COVID-19 mRNA booster dose in a cohort of pregnant, lactating, and age-matched nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGNWe characterized the antibody response against ancestral Spike and Omicron in a cohort of 31 pregnant, 12 lactating and 20 nonpregnant age-matched controls who received a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster dose after primary COVID-19 vaccination. We also examined the vaccine-induced antibody profiles of 15 maternal:cord dyads at delivery. RESULTSReceipt of a booster dose during pregnancy resulted in increased IgG1 against Omicron Spike (post-primary vaccination vs post-booster, p = 0.03). Pregnant and lactating individuals exhibited equivalent Spike-specific total IgG1, IgM and IgA levels and neutralizing titers against Omicron compared to nonpregnant women. Subtle differences in Fc-receptor binding and antibody subclass profiles were observed in the immune response to a booster dose in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. Analysis of maternal and cord antibody profiles at delivery demonstrated equivalent total Spike-specific IgG1 in maternal and cord blood, yet higher Spike-specific Fc{gamma}R3a-binding antibodies in the cord relative to maternal blood (p = 0.002), consistent with preferential transfer of highly functional IgG. Spike-specific IgG1 levels in the cord were positively correlated with time elapsed since receipt of the booster dose (Spearman R 0.574, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that receipt of a booster dose during pregnancy induces a robust Spike-specific humoral immune response, including against Omicron. If boosting occurs in the third trimester, higher Spike-specific cord IgG1 levels are achieved with greater time elapsed between receipt of the booster and delivery. Receipt of a booster dose has the potential to augment maternal and neonatal immunity.","output":"COVID-19 booster dose antibody response in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We assessed the impact of COVID-19 on children with epilepsy and their families, focusing on epilepsy management, family routines, learning, and adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pandemic guidelines (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing) within the first six months of the pandemic. Group differences in COVID-19 impact on families were also examined based on race and ethnicity, being medically and/or geographically underserved, and insurance status. METHODS Participants (n = 131) included children with epilepsy and their families from two clinical trials. The Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Epilepsy Management (ICPEM) measure was developed and administered to caregivers online from April 2020 to September 2020 across four large pediatric hospitals.

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic put a heavy strain on the healthcare system of many countries. Governments chose different approaches to face the spread of the virus and the contact tracing apps were considered the most effective ones. In particular, by leveraging on the Bluetooth Low-Energy technology, mobile apps allow to achieve a privacy-preserving contact tracing of citizens. While researchers proposed several contact tracing approaches, each government developed its own national contact tracing app. In this paper, we demonstrate that many popular contact tracing apps (e.g., the ones promoted by the Italian, French, Swiss government) are vulnerable to relay attacks. Through such attacks people might get misleadingly diagnosed as positive to SARS-CoV-2, thus being enforced to quarantine and eventually leading to a breakdown of the healthcare system. To tackle this vulnerability, we propose a novel and lightweight solution that prevents relay attacks, while providing the same privacy-preserving features as the current approaches. To evaluate the feasibility of both the relay attack and our novel defence mechanism, we developed a proof of concept against the Italian contact tracing app (i.e., Immuni). The design of our defence allows it to be integrated into any contact tracing app. To foster the adoption of our solution in contact tracing apps and encourage developers to integrate it in the future releases, we publish the source code. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Contact Tracing Made Un-relay-able"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biometric tech vendors are continuing to play a lead part in the planned rollout of secure digital Covid vaccination passports worldwide.

Women refugees are classified as a vulnerable group with regard to pregnancy outcomes and access to maternal care, and may be disproportionally at risk for COVID-19 infection as they are likely to face unique barriers to information and access to reproductive health services during the pandemic. Few studies identify gaps that could inform potential interventions to improve service uptake for refugee women, particularly in the context of COVID-19. Yet, understanding how pregnant refugees are impacted in the context of the pandemic is critical to developing and implementing strategies and measures that can help in their care and the delivery of health services.

FINDINGS: Our findings suggest that within the first eight months of COVID-19, preferences for home deliveries by refugee women increased and health care workers reported having observed reduced utilisation of services and delayed care. Fear, economic challenges and lack of migrant-inclusive health system policies were key factors influencing home deliveries and delayed and low uptake of facility-based care.

Annual influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. The use of immunomodulatory agents such as statins to target host inflammatory responses in influenza virus infection has been suggested as an adjunct treatment, especially during pandemics, when antiviral quantities are limited or vaccine production can be delayed. Methods. We used population-based, influenza hospitalization surveillance data, propensity score-matched analysis, and Cox regression to determine whether there was an association between mortality (within 30 days of a positive influenza test) and statin treatment among hospitalized cohorts from 2 influenza seasons (October 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008 and September 1, 2009 to April 31, 2010).

One of these measures was tests in origin for travelers. Testing strategies for COVID-19 facilitate the overall public health response to the pandemic and contributes to minimize the infection among the population COVID-19. GOAL: In this work, we assess the efficiency of diagnostic testing of incoming travelers in the Canary Islands, Spain, during a period of 4 months, with a focus on the economic impact for the regional government. We study the cost-benefit of this measure as well as the potential influence on the number of positive cases in the population. METHODS: We processed the real data in the Canary Islands of pre-flight PCR and antigen tests that were required to the residents when traveling back to the Canaries from anywhere in Spain in a period of 4 months, from 14 December, 2020 to 4 April, 2021. As a result, we calculated the economic impact of doing those tests and compare them with the estimated costs of passengers under the hypothesis of entering the islands without testing. The cost-benefit was obtained for different scenarios, where the incoming passengers generated hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) costs directly and via transmissions. RESULTS: The incoming testing funded by the government, if applied during the bad evolution of the pandemic with 1.2 ratio of transmission, clearly saved money to the public health system. In addition to the economic impact of this measure, we estimated the potential influence on the number of positive cases in the population according to different scenarios of the propagation of the pandemic. At the beginning of February 2021, the savings were about 130.551,47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 24.677,94C236.425,00. By the end of April 2021, the savings were above 2,000,000 (2.284.788,50 on average and 95% CI of 2.092.914,84C2.476.662,16) and the savings increased as the pandemic evolved. At the end of the period, the savings were twice the expenses. CONCLUSIONS: Testing in origin has proved to be a good measure that helped to mitigate COVID-19 spread among regions. Our results confirm that the free PCR or rapid antigen tests produce relevant savings to the public budget. We studied 61.990 reported data during 2020 and 2021 from the travelers from national flights, against 346.449 of total incoming travelers to the Canary Islands in this period. The measure pursued by the Government of the Canary Islands of providing free tests for residents showed a clear benefit for both, limiting the propagation of COVID-19 and reducing the costs of the hospitalizations and ICU admissions. It should be noted that the free testing measure in this period was before starting the vaccination campaigns. As measure of public health in the airports, testing helped to control and make the mobility of travelers secure.","output":"Evaluation of Cost-Benefit and Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic for Incoming Travelers Through Tests in Origin in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Berry discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic affects her skills in the kitchen and her kind of eating When the world suddenly changed, we are not supposed to touch our own faces and not supposed to touch our friends In spite of this--because of this--this all boils down to touch where she associates to King Midas, the mythological king who turned everything he touched into gold She reflects that with the COVID-19 pandemic, anything that is touched could turn into sickness and may even lead to death","output":"The Anxiety Kitchen, or Cooking for the People I Cannot Hug"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak that spread in December 2019 has caused the death of millions of people in a short time.

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that certain heavy metalloids and metals interfere with protein folding of nascent proteins in cells and their biological function can be altered. It is unknown whether the drug impurities including heavy metals may affect the tertiary protein structure. Materials and Methods: ReciGen and Rebif are pharmaceutical interferon beta-1a (IFN-1a) contained in preparations that are used for parenteral administration. Heavy metal impurities of these samples have been studied by gel electrophoresis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis (ICP MS). The concentration of heavy metals including mercury, arsenic, nickel, chromium, iron, and aluminum did not exceed permitted levels established by International Council for Harmonisation guideline for elemental impurities. Results: The ICP MS analysis revealed the presence of heavy metals, moreover zeta potential was significantly different for IFN-1a, which can be an indirect indication of the difference in composition of ReciGen and Rebif samples, respectively. FTIR analysis revealed very similar amide I and II bonds at 1654 and 1560 cm(?1) attributed to the peptide absorption peaks of IFN-1a in Rebif and ReciGen.

We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by online telemedicine increased following the emergence of COVID-19. METHODS: We examined 3915 requests for self-managed abortion to online telemedicine service Women on Web (WoW) between 1 January 2019 and 1 June 2020. We used regression discontinuity to compare request rates in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. RESULTS: Five countries showed significant increases in requests to WoW, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (97 requests vs 75.8 expected requests, p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (34 requests vs 14.2 expected requests, p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (1 request vs 8.1 expected requests, p<0.001). Among countries with significant increases in requests, abortion services are provided mainly in person in hospitals or abortion is unavailable and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain implemented a fully remote no-test telemedicine service. CONCLUSION: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate demand for remote models of care, which could be fulfilled by expanding access to medication abortion by telemedicine.","output":"Demand for self-managed online telemedicine abortion in eight European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a regression discontinuity analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) is a multi-stage autoimmune-mediated disease associated with a multitude of neuropsychiatric and dysautonomic features. Orofacial dyskinesias are frequently associated with this condition and manifest as abnormal movements of the orofacial musculature. These involuntary movements may result in significant trauma to the oral and maxillofacial complex including the avulsion of the dentition and orofacial lacerations. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the course of two female patients with anti-NMDARE in whom significant involuntary self-inflicted maxillofacial trauma was suffered despite the use of complex parenteral sedation regimens. The application of traditional maxillomandibular wiring techniques and pharmacologic strategies, including botulinum toxin, to immobilize the mandible were initially unsuccessful. These difficulties led to the fabrication and wire-based fixation of a patient-specific acrylic oral appliance that maintained the mandible in a depressed position and mitigated all lateral and protrusive movements. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate the first known successful use of an appliance-based therapy for managing orofacial dyskinesias in the anti-NMDARE patient population through an adaptation of traditional maxillomandibular fixation techniques. This approach eliminated further orofacial trauma and afforded physicians with safer means to manage and assess patients afflicted with this condition during their protracted intensive care unit admissions.","output":"Prevention of oral and maxillofacial trauma secondary to orofacial dyskinesias associated with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious infection that may break the healthcare system of several countries.

We investigate the impact of an institution-wide community tour on incoming residents sense of preparedness to provide care to impoverished patients and their knowledge of social determinants of health. Methods: A two-hour voluntary bus tour of an inner-city hospitals catchment area was offered to incoming residents during orientations in June 2016 and 2017. Residents visited a local school, healthcare clinic, needle-exchange program, police precinct, homeless shelter, and community park, among other locations. Pre-tour surveys were collected from individuals present at orientation, and post-tour surveys were collected from those who attended. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to gauge preparedness to work with impoverished patients and subjective knowledge of social determinants of health. Numerical values of 1 to 5 were designated as strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree, respectively. Numerical values of 4 and 5 were deemed as high. A 9-option multiple choice question assessed objective knowledge of the hospitals catchment area poverty rate. Fishers exact test was used to determine statistical significance. Results: 219 incoming residents completed the pre-tour survey, 91 demonstrated interest in attending the tour (41.6%), and 76 completed the post-tour survey. Of the 219 residents who completed the pre-tour survey, majority specialized in internal medicine (89, 40.6%), pediatrics (32, 14.6%), OMFS (25, 11.4%), transitional year (25, 11.4%), and emergency medicine (19, 8.7%);the remainder were psychiatry, OB-GYN, and general surgery. The majority of participants endorsed previous experience working with underserved populations (196 of 219, 89.5%). A significantly larger percentage of participants rated their preparedness to work with impoverished patients as high after the tour (63/76, 82.9%) than before (157/219, 71.7%) (Fishers exact test p = 0.0021). Similarly, a large fraction rated their knowledge of social determinants of health as high after the tour (64/76, 84.2%) than before (85/219, 38.8%) (Fishers exact test p < 0.0001). The percent of participants reporting the correct poverty rate significantly increased from 13/219 (5.9%) to 19/76 (25%) (Fishers exact test p < 0.0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a community bus-tour of an inner-city hospitals catchment area augmented incoming residents preparedness to work with an impoverished population and their knowledge of social determinants of health. As most participants demonstrated similar levels of preparedness and knowledge prior to the tour, it is likely that new physicians would benefit from direct exposure to their hospitals surrounding communities at the start of residency. As COVID-19 health measures are mitigated, residency programs should strongly consider tours or other community immersion experiences to assist with new residents knowledge and preparedness to care for their respective patient communities.","output":"The Impact of a Community Tour on Incoming Residents During Orientation at an Inner-City Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, which is caused by infection of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 The virus infects lung cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of cell surface, which leads to leukocyte infiltration, increased permeability of blood vessels and alveolar walls, and decreased surfactant in the lung, causing respiratory symptoms The aggravation of local inflammation causes cytokine storm, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome In December 2019, a number of new pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, after then a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified as SARS-CoV-2 To the date of Sep 13th, 2020, COVID-19 is affecting 216 countries or regions, causing 28 637 952 cases, 917 417 deaths, and the mortality rate is 3 20% This review will summarize the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the pharmaceutical treatment of COVID-19, and their potential relationships","output":"[Structure of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 303/673 rural Ecuadorian adults (45%), 77% of whom had compatible clinical manifestations.

Preliminary data from China indicated a substantial impact on mental health by the pandemic and its associated lockdown measures. Such measures are unprecedented for the majority of people and may affect their lives tremendously. The current survey was developed to assess mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany. Methods We conducted a web-based self-report survey including various aspects of mental health (e.g. PHQ-D, PHQ-4, WHO-5 and comparative questions on a 5-point Likert scale concerning sleep, irritability & interpersonal violence). First wave data were taken during the height of lockdown measures in Germany from 1 April to 15 April 2020. Results A total of 3,545 volunteers took part in this cross-sectional survey. Mean age was 40.36 years (SD = 11.70; 83.1% female, 15.2% male). Acute or chronic disease was reported by 36.7% (physical) and 24.7% (mental) of subjects. Participants scored mild severity distress in the PHQ stress module. Depression and anxiety as assessed by PHQ-4 was significantly higher than in reference samples. The mean well-being score (WHO-5) was 50.7, thus pointing towards possible signs of depression. Furthermore, we found significant gender differences for anxiety and depression with women showing higher levels. 45.3% of participants reported worsened sleep, increased levels of irritation, anger and aggression compared to pre-pandemic times. Most importantly, 5% of all participants reported experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV). Discussion This is one of the first and largest surveys on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in a European society reflecting a relatively well educated and financially secure sample. Yet, there is evidence for a substantial mental burden with increased levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and irritability. Most importantly and also most concerning is the finding of a one-month prevalence of 5% IPV. We think it is of vital importance to continuously monitor the mental health of the general public during this pandemic and its aftermath and to carefully screen for IPV and its risk factors such as stress, sleep problems and anger.","output":"The German COVID-19 Survey on Mental Health: Primary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 creates disruption, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity in all organizations.

Screen validity was confirmed internally by a Z = 0.5 and externally by detecting previously reported host-targeting anti-M.tb compounds. Inhibitors of the CHK kinase family, specifically checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), showed the highest inhibition and lowest toxicity of all kinase families. The screen identified and validated DDUG, a CHK2 inhibitor, as a novel bactericidal anti-M.tb compound. CHK2 inhibition by RNAi phenocopied the intracellular inhibitory effect of DDUG. DDUG was active intracellularly against M.tb, but not other mycobacteria. DDUG also had extracellular activity against 4 of 12 bacteria tested, including M.tb. Combined, these observations suggest DDUG acts in tandem against both host and pathogen.

In the absence of an approved curing medicine or approved vaccine to date, the major control of the surge of infections is through use of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and imposing specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) in instances when the disease spread curbs are relaxed. It is thus essential to quantify the extent to which specific NPIs can be useful in containing the pandemic. To achieve this, we constructed a mathematical model that accounts for both person to person transmission as well as transmission through contact from pathogen-contaminated surfaces. The model assumes that there is change of behaviour resulting from the surge of the number of cases, hence a class of susceptible individuals who practise self-protection measures. Basic properties of the model including the conditions for existence and stability of steady states are explored. The model was fitted to new-cases data for South Africa and baseline parameter values were estimated. Sensitivity analysis of the model was performed to determine the most influential parameters on the disease threshold. Our results show that practising of self-protection measures is vital in slowing the spread of the infection. In addition, it is evident from the results that minimizing contact through physical distancing as well as with contaminated surfaces can significantly help in containing the infection. The model was extended to account for testing and quarantining of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. In addition, migration and potential use of a vaccine were explored. In the case of migration, the scenarios considered included aspects when there are both border control and illegal crossings as well as the case where the government is in full control with proper SOPs. Our results show that, although testing and isolating/quarantining of infected individuals is essential in curbing new infections, it ought to be done in conjunction with implementation of other control measures if the disease is to be curtailed in a shorter period of time. More still, when an effective vaccine is available, even a [Formula: see text] coverage in one community may not be enough to completely stop new infections in the presence of migration. We therefore recommend that vaccination ought to be done universally if the daily number of new infections is to be reduced to zero.","output":"Modelling Covid-19 mitigation and control strategies in the presence of migration and vaccination: the case of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-fat diet (HFD) leads to systemic low-grade inflammation, which has been involved in the pathogenesis of diverse metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Colon is thought to be the first organ suffering from inflammation under HFD conditions due to the pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltration, however, the mechanisms concerning the induction of pro-inflammatory phenotype of colonic macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we show that HFD increased the percentage of gram-positive bacteria, especially genus Clostridium, and resulted in the significant increment of fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut microbial metabolite produced by bacteria mainly restricted to genus Clostridium. Notably, reducing gram-positive bacteria with vancomycin diminished fecal DCA and profoundly alleviated pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in colon, whereas DCA-supplemented feedings to vancomycin-treated mice provoked obvious pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and colonic inflammation. Meanwhile, intra-peritoneal administration of DCA also elicited considerable recruitment of macrophages with pro-inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, DCA dose-dependently promoted M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at least partially through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) transactivated by M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2-mAchR)/Src pathway. In addition, M2-mAchR mediated increase of TLR2 transcription was mainly achieved via targeting AP-1 transcription factor. Moreover, NF-&#954;B/ERK/JNK signalings downstream of TLR2 are involved in the DCA-induced macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our findings revealed that high level DCA induced by HFD may serve as an initiator to activate macrophages and drive colonic inflammation, thus offer a mechanistic basis that modulation of gut microbiota or intervening specific bile acid receptor signaling could be potential therapeutic approaches for HFD-related inflammatory diseases.","output":"Gut microbial bile acid metabolite skews macrophage polarization and contributes to high-fat diet-induced colonic inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duration of mechanical intubation (14.7 vs. 18.5 d, p = 0.078), ICU length of stay (16.4 vs. 21.3 d, p = 0.033), and hospital length of stay (22.5 vs 27.8 d, p = 0.039) were all shorter in the ED-intubated population.

While there are several reports on COVID-19's impact on inpatient palliative care, literature is limited about the impact on outpatient care which may be more relevant for these patients. AIM: To generate a person-centered description of the impact of COVID-19 from the perspectives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers to improve outpatient palliative care delivery. DESIGN: This qualitative study used rapid analysis via matrix design to identify emergent themes related to participant perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, open-ended survey responses, medical record documentation and participant-researcher communications. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Data was collected from 108 patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and 90 caregivers enrolled in a multicenter, clinical trial of community-based, outpatient palliative care between March 20, 2020 and August 8, 2020 (NCT03076671). RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (1) disruptions to delivery of healthcare and other supportive services; (2) increased symptomatic and psychosocial needs; (3) increased caregiver burden; (4) limitations of telecommunications when compared to in-person contact. We observed that these themes interacted and intersected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers have unmet care needs because of the pandemic, exacerbated by social isolation. While telemedicine has helped improve access to healthcare, patients and caregivers perceive clear limitations compared to in-person services.

In this study, we determined the clinical and laboratory characteristics of these Iranian patients and discussed possible reasons. METHOD We retrospectively investigated the SARS Cov-2 PCR tests performed in the three referral hospitals six months after the pandemic onset. All patients who had the following criteria were included in the study: two SARS COV2 PCR positive tests three months apart, have no symptoms, and a negative PCR between the two positive tests, access to the patient and his medical information. Then, retrospectively recorded the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the eligible patients. We also compare clinical and laboratory features of the second episode to the first. RESULT A total of 32,567 tests were performed, of which 1899 patients. Finally, 37 cases were eligible in the study based on our criteria. The majority of patients were male and nurses. The mean body mass index was 25.843.25. The mean age was 37.54 15.16 years old. Weakness, myalgia, and fever were the most clinical presentation symptoms in both episodes.

METHODS: We used cross-sectional survey data from wave 3 participant visits (2017-2018) within Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study; a longitudinal, community-based cohort of women living with human immunodeficiency virus in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Our primary outcome was derived from response to the statement: '[HIV non-disclosure case law has] increased my experiences of verbal/physical/sexual violence from sexual partners'. Participants responding 'strongly agree/agree' were deemed to have experienced increased violence due to the law. Participants responding 'not applicable' (i.e. those without sexual partners) were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors independently associated with increased violence from sexual partners due to human immunodeficiency virus non-disclosure case law. RESULTS: We included 619/937 wave 3 participants. Median age was 46 (interquartile range: 39-53) and 86% had experienced verbal/physical/sexual violence in adulthood. Due to concerns about human immunodeficiency virus non-disclosure case law, 37% had chosen not to have sex with a new partner, and 20% had disclosed their human immunodeficiency virus status to sexual partners before a witness.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of heme metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryoCelectron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD harbors a dominant epitope, access to which can be controlled by an allosteric mechanism that is regulated through recruitment of a metabolite.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 can recruit a heme metabolite to evade antibody immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pests threaten worldwide food security by decreasing crop yields and damaging their quality. Natural product-based molecular design and structural optimization have been one of the most effective ways to innovate pesticides for integrated insect management. To continue our previous studies on the discovery of insecticidal lead, a series of evodiamine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their insecticidal activities. The bioassay results demonstrated that compounds Ian and Iao exhibited 90 and 80% insecticidal activities against Mythimna separata at 2.5 mg/L, respectively, which were superior to evodiamine (10% at 10 mg/L), matrine (45% at 600 mg/L), and rotenone (30% at 200 mg/L). Compounds Ian-Iap showed 90% insecticidal activities against Plutella xylostella at 1.0 mg/L, far more potent than those of evodiamine, matrine, and rotenone. Compound Ian displayed 60% insecticidal activity against Helicoverpa armigera at 5.0 mg/L, while evodiamine, matrine, and rotenone showed very poor activities. The study on the insecticidal mechanism of action by a calcium imaging experiment indicated that the insect ryanodine receptors (RyRs) could be the potential target of Ian. Furthermore, the molecular docking indicated that Ian anchored in the binding site of the RyR of P. xylostella.

AIM: The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether omega-3 supplementation is protective against alcohol use disorder relapse after hospital discharge. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out with severe alcohol dependence. Male inpatients were randomized to treatment with omega-3 (n = 59) or placebo (n = 52) for 3 months, participants were assessed after discharge at 1 month (T1), 2 months (T2), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T4) with assessments made using self-report instruments. The primary outcomes were the possible reduction with assessments made using self-report instruments. The primary outcomes were the possible reduction in the number, intensity of relapses, amount of consumption in each relapse and number of days of consumption during relapses; as secondary outcomes were assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression, degree of dependence, compulsion, and craving. RESULTS: The groups were similar regarding consumption amount parameters and propensity to relapse; however, an effect of treatment with omega-3 was found on the number of days of drinking at 2 months [B = 0.65 (0.09; 1, 21), p = 0.01] and 3 months [B = 2.6 (1.61; 3.58), p < 0.001] after discharge, favoring the intervention group. The effect was not maintained at follow up of 6 months. No differences were found in psychiatric symptoms and severity of addiction. CONCLUSION: Despite the major limitations of the present study, the group that received omega-3 had a lower number of days of consumption of standard doses of alcohol in the evaluations of 60 and 90 days after discharge.

When disciplines have worked together to undertake testing, deliver care and administer vaccines, progress against COVID-19 has been made. Yet, teamwork has often not happened, wasting precious resources and stretching health-care workforces. Continuing to train health professionals during the pandemic is challenging, particularly delivering interprofessional education that often uses face-to-face delivery methods to optimise interactional learning. Yet, continuing to offer interprofessional education throughout the pandemic is critical to ensure a collaboration-ready health workforce. One example is continuing the established INVOLVE (Interprofessional Visits to Learn Interprofessional Values through Patient Experience) interprofessional education initiative. ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEM Educators have not always prioritised interprofessional education during the pandemic, despite its immediate and long-term benefits. The INVOLVE interprofessional education initiative, usually delivered face-to-face, was at risk of cancellation. RESULTS A quality improvement analysis of the strategies used to continue INVOLVE demonstrated that it is possible to deliver interprofessional education within the constraints of a pandemic by using innovative online and hybrid educational strategies. Educators and students demonstrated flexibility in responding to the sudden changes in teaching and learning modalities. STRATEGIES When pandemic alert levels change, interprofessional educators and administrators can now choose from a repertoire of teaching approaches.

Vaccine development efforts have predominantly been aimed at 'Extra-viral' Spike (S) protein as vaccine vehicles, but there are concerns regarding viral immune escape since multiple mutations may enable the mutated virus strains to escape from immunity against S protein. The Intra-viral Nucleocapsid (N-protein) is relatively conserved among mutant strains of coronaviruses during spread and evolution. Herein, we demonstrate novel vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 by using the whole conserved N-protein or its fragment/peptides. Using ELISA assay, we showed that high titers of specific anti-N antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM) were maintained for a reasonably long duration (> 5 months), suggesting that N-protein is an excellent immunogen to stimulate host immune system and robust B-cell activation. We synthesized three peptides located at the conserved regions of N-protein among CoVs. One peptide showed as a good immunogen for vaccination as well. Cytokine arrays on post-vaccination mouse sera showed progressive up-regulation of various cytokines such as IFN- and CCL5, suggesting that T(H)1 associated responses are also stimulated. Furthermore, vaccinated mice exhibited an elevated memory T cells population. Here, we propose an unconventional vaccine strategy targeting the conserved N-protein as an alternative vaccine target for coronaviruses. Moreover, we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody specifically against an epitope shared between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and we are currently developing the First-in-Class humanized anti-N-protein antibody to potentially treat patients infected by various CoVs in the future.","output":"Targeting intra-viral conserved nucleocapsid (N) proteins as novel vaccines against SARS-CoVs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to reasons beyond control, health care workers have struggled to deliver treatment for the patients with cancer.

On the other hand, influenza type A viruses are recognized to cause severe and fatal infections in children populations worldwide. This study is aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections. METHODS: A retrospective study comprising 107 children hospitalized at Abha Maternity and Children Hospital, Southern region of Saudi Arabia, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections was carried out. A complete follow-up for all patients from the hospital admission until discharge or death was made. The clinical data and laboratory parameters for these patients were collected from the medical records of the hospital. RESULTS: Out of the total enrolled patients, 73 (68.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 34 (31.8%) were diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. The median age is 12 months for COVID-19 patients and 36 months for influenza patients. A relatively higher number of patients with influenza had a fever and respiratory symptoms than COVID-19 patients. In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in a higher number of COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients.

SUMMARY An 86-year-old man on dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily for stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation was admitted to the hospital for bowel obstruction and severe acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. The patient had an abnormal coagulation profile and no history of bleeding. Initial laboratory values revealed a hemoglobin concentration of 10.7 g/dL, a platelet count of 115  103 platelets/L, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 150.4 seconds, an international normalized ratio of 10.28, a thrombin time greater than 100 seconds and a serum creatinine of 5.54 mg/dL (490 mol/L). An initial dose of idarucizumab was administered 1 hour prior to surgery to prevent bleeding. Significant bleeding and hemodynamic instability occurred following surgery. Three additional doses of idarucizumab, 2 sessions of intermittent hemodialysis, continuous venovenous hemofiltration and blood products were required to achieve normalization of coagulation parameters and hemodynamic stability due to rebound coagulopathy after each dose of idarucizumab. CONCLUSION Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease and third-space redistribution could have led to important dabigatran accumulation and favored rebound coagulopathy.

METHODS This mixed methods cohort study recruited adults age 65 with advanced NSCLC starting palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy from a Comprehensive Cancer Center, Veterans Affairs, and safety-net clinic. Patients completed geriatric assessments including Life-Space Assessment (LSA) pretreatment and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment initiation. LSA scores range from 0 to 120 (greater mobility); LSA <60 is considered restricted. We used mixed-effects models to examine pretreatment LSA, change from 0 to 1 month, and change from 1 to 6 months. A subgroup participated in semistructured interviews pretreatment and at 2 and 6 months to understand the patient experience of life-space change. For each interview participant, we created joint displays of longitudinal LSA scores juxtaposed with illustrative quotes. RESULTS Among 93 patients, median age was 73 (range 65-94). Mean pretreatment LSA score was 67.1. On average, LSA declined 10.1 points from pretreatment to 1 month and remained stable at 6 months. Pretreatment LSA score was associated with several demographic, clinical, geriatric assessment, and symptom characteristics. LSA decline at 1 month was greater among patients with high anxiety (slope = -12.6 vs. -2.3, p = 0.048). Pretreatment body mass index <21 kg/m2 was associated with LSA improvement from 1 to 6 months (slope = 4.1 vs. -0.04, p = 0.003). Joint displays illustrated the impact of different life-space trajectories on patients' lives in their words. CONCLUSION Older adults with NSCLC have low pretreatment life space with many developing restricted life space during treatment.

In the first stage, initially, COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the existing deep CNN models.

We report a case of a prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with clinical relapses of COVID-19 in a lymphoma patient. MethodsNasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Real time-PCR (RT-PCR). On five positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we performed viral culture and next generation sequencing. We analysed the patients adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T and NK cell subsets. FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive with cycle threshold mean values of 22 {+/-} 1{middle dot}3 for over 8 months. All five performed viral cultures were positive and genomic analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive in three out of four COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. T and NK cells dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic samples and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected throughout the disease course. InterpretationIn our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for over eight months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses and remdesivir treatment was effective in viremia clearance and symptoms remission, although it was unable to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood that are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication. In addition we found a high level of NK cells repertoire perturbation with a relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.

In this study, unsupervised neural networks of the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) type were used to assess the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 in Brazil, according to the number of cases and deaths in regions, states, and cities. Materials and methods: The SOM applied in this context does not evaluate which measures applied have helped contain the spread of the disease, but these datasets represent the repercussions of the country's measures, which were implemented to contain the virus' spread. Results: This approach demonstrated that the spread of the disease in Brazil does not have a standard behavior, changing according to the region, state, or city. The analyses showed that cities and states in the north and northeast regions of the country were the most affected by the disease, with the highest number of cases and deaths registered per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: The SOM clustering was able to spatially group cities, states, and regions according to their coronavirus cases, with similar behavior. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the use of similar strategies to deal with the virus' spread in these cities, states, and regions.","output":"The Spread of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Brazil: An Overview by Kohonen Self-Organizing Map Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The information generated from the official eradication programs of caprine tuberculosis (TB) in Castilla y Len, Spain, during 2018, has been used to assess the effect of vaccination against paratuberculosis (PTB) and the presence of this infection, on the single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) test results. Data from 121665 goats belonging to 1936 different herds were analyzed using generalized linear models. An epidemiological survey was conducted to know the herd immunization status against PTB and the date of last vaccination. All SIT test-positive animals were further investigated in order to confirm the diagnosis of TB, through bacterial culture, and PTB, by histopathological and qPCR analyses. SIT positivity was found in 39 (2.01%) herds, and 507 (0.41%) goats. TB was confirmed by M. caprae or M. bovis isolation in 10 (0.51%) herds and 46 (0.038%) goats. PTB was diagnosed in 13 (33.33%) and 55 (10.84%) of the SIT test-positive herds and goats respectively. Vaccination against PTB showed a significant influence on the results of the SIT test at herd level, with higher positivity detected among those herds vaccinated. However, this effect was not observed when the total number of animals was considered, where the highest positivity was found in unvaccinated goats. The time elapsed between vaccination and SIT test performance also influenced the results. The strongest effect was found when less than eight months elapsed between performing both activities, and to a lesser extent between 8-12 months. Conversely, no positive herds or animals were found when the time elapsed was higher than one year. No significant effect of the presence of PTB was observed. These findings demonstrate that the use of PTB vaccine does not result in false positives to a SIT test at individual level, provided that the time elapsed between the performance of both practices is higher than 12 months.","output":"Influence of vaccination against paratuberculosis on the diagnosis of caprine tuberculosis during official eradication programs in Castilla y Len (Spain)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To determine accuracy of infrared thermometer for detection of fever as compared to mercury thermometer Study Design: Cross sectional study Place and Duration of Study: Department of Medicine, Combined Military Hospital Peshawar, from May to Jun 2020 Methodology: All willing adult patients reporting to the fever desk were selected by consecutive sampling Exclusion criteria included any dermatological condition affecting forehead and unwillingness Forehead temperature was first checked twice using Kinlee FT3010 infrared thermometer Axillary temperature was then recorded using a standard clinical mercury thermometer Results: There were 538 patients, including 251 (46 65%) males and 287 (53 35%) females, aged 46 76  12 44 years Median temperatures recorded with infrared and mercury thermometers were 97 00F (interquartile range: 95 10-97 80F) and 98 30F (interquartile range: 98 00-98 90F) respectively (p0 001) Intra-class correlation was 0 143 (95% CI -0 052, 0 323) There was a weak to moderate correlation (R: 0 366;p0 001) between temperatures recorded by the two techniques ROC curve analysis for temperatures recorded by infrared thermometer revealed an area under curve of 0 725 at a threshold of 98 6F and 0 746 at a threshold of 100 4F defined by mercury thermometer Infrared thermometer had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 13 61% and 9 38%, 97 95% and 99 80%, 71 43% and 75 00%, and 75 10% and 95 57% for thresholds of 98 6F and 100 4F respectively Conclusion: Infrared thermometer underestimates temperatures recorded by mercury thermometer Limits of agreement are too broad, indicating inconsistency in measurements A significantly lower threshold is required to improve the sensitivity of Infrared thermometer in picking up fever","output":"Usefulness of Forehead Infrared Thermometers to Screen Patients for Fever during Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have manifested a variety of neurological complications, and there is still much to reveal regarding the neurotropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed essential for viral replication. We examined the activation status and requirement of the master UPR sensor IRE1 kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1 as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1 whereby it autophosphorylates, but its RNase fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, IRE1 was dispensable for optimal replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested. Our findings demonstrate that IRE1 activation status differs upon infection with distinct betacoronaviruses and is not essential for efficient replication of any of them. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1 through an unknown mechanism, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system. ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is the third lethal respiratory coronaviruses after MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to emerge this century, causing millions of deaths world-wide. Other common coronaviruses such as OC43 cause less severe respiratory disease. Thus, it is imperative to understand the similarities and differences among these viruses in how each interacts with host cells. We focused here on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway, part of the host unfolded protein response to virus-induced stress. We found that while MERS-CoV and OC43 fully activate the IRE1 kinase and RNase activites, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1, promoting its kinase activity but not RNase activity. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 prevents IRE1 RNase activation as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 diverges from other betacoronaviruses in only partially activating the IRE1/XBP1 ER stress pathway in human lung-derived cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with prostate cancer can have several debilitating side effects. Supervised exercise is recommended to ameliorate these negative effects. OBJECTIVE To systematically evaluate the effect of supervised exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy in patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT, primarily according to the patient critical outcomes, 'disease-specific quality of life' and 'walking performance' measured at end of treatment. METHODS We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cinahl and Pedro, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated the effect of supervised exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT, last search: June 2021. Two independent reviewers extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE-method. RESULTS Eigthteen RCTs (n = 1477) comprised patients with prostate cancer stages T1-T4 were included in the meta-analyses. Compared to no exercise therapy, supervised exercise therapy showed clinically relevant improvements in 'disease-specific quality of life' and 'walking performance'. The standardised mean differences were 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.58) and -0.41 (95% CI: -0.60, -0.22), respectively. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to serious risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Evidence of moderate quality shows that supervised exercise therapy probably is superior to no exercise therapy in improving 'disease-specific quality of life' and 'walking performance' in patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. The results apply to all patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy regardless of cancer stage. The results support a strong recommendation for supervised exercise therapy for managing side effects in this population.

However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37C73; recruited 2006C2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96C1.30)), whereas those with 2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28C1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and 2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12C1.46) and 1.77 (1.46C2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI 40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09C3.78); 2.79 (2.00C3.90); 2.66 (1.88C3.76); 2.13 (1.46C3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","output":"Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and COVID-19 infection within the UK Biobank cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is concern in Germany that the capacity of intensive care unit (ICU) beds may not be sufficient for the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to determine the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care from 11 April through 30 June 2020. METHODS: We assumed three non-exponential scenarios for the development of the cumulative case numbers up to 30 June 2020 (linear, slow quadratic, and fast quadratic). We assumed that 3-10% of of patients would require intensive care, that 8 days would elapse from a positive test to the need for intensive care, and that intensive care would be necessary for 14 or 20 days. RESULTS: Extrapolation of the maximum registered daily COVID-19 cases reveals a range of 4133 to 12 233 cases. Assuming that 3-10% of newly detected COVID-19 cases become intensive care patients and the average length of ICU stay is between 14 and 20 days, we arrive at a maximum daily number of ICU cases between 1989 (linear extrapolation, 3% ICU, 14 days in ICU) and 20 966 (fast quadratic extrapolation, 10% ICU, 20 days in ICU). CONCLUSION: Our results give no rise for concern that triage of COVID-19 patients may become necessary in Germany. However, the occupancy of ICU beds should be managed centrally to ensure optimal use of bed capacity.

From the eight studies it included, the review found limited and low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with COVID-19.

As African countries brace for the further spread of the virus, while exploring potential therapeutic options to mitigate its morbidity and mortality at peak, convalescent plasma transfusion may offer a therapeutic ray of hope for the continent.

However, the magnitude, repertoire, and phenotype of epitope-specific T cell responses to this vaccine, and the effect of vaccination on pre-existing T cell memory in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients, are still poorly understood. Thus, in this study we compared epitope-specific T cells elicited after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccination of both naive and recovered individuals. We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after BNT162b2 vaccination and used pools of 18 DNA-barcoded MHC-class I multimers, combined with scRNAseq and scTCRseq, to characterize T cell responses to several immunodominant epitopes, including a spike-derived epitope cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. Comparing responses after infection or vaccination, we found that T cells responding to spike-derived epitopes show similar magnitudes of response, memory phenotypes, TCR repertoire diversity, and TCR sequence motifs, demonstrating the potency of this vaccination platform. Importantly, in COVID-19-recovered individuals receiving the vaccine, pre-existing spike-specific memory cells showed both clonal expansion and a phenotypic shift towards more differentiated CCR7-CD45RA+ effector cells. In-depth analysis of T cell receptor repertoires demonstrates that both vaccination and infection elicit largely identical repertoires as measured by dominant TCR motifs and receptor breadth, indicating that BNT162b2 vaccination largely recapitulates T cell generation by infection for all critical parameters. Thus, BNT162b2 vaccination elicits potent spike-specific T cell responses in naive individuals and also triggers the recall T cell response in previously infected individuals, further boosting spike-specific responses but altering their differentiation state. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of mRNA vaccines to induce, maintain, and shape T cell memory through vaccination and revaccination.","output":"Convergent epitope-specific T cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global surveillance programs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are showing the emergence of variants with mutations in the spike protein.

Using the enantiomerically pure (R)- and (S)-forms of the ligand, depending on the organometallic moiety, either the SM,R or RM,S diastereomers, respectively, were observed in the molecular structures of the Ru- and Os(cym) (cym = ?6-p-cymene) compounds, whereas the RM,R or SM,S diastereomers were found for the Rh- and Ir(Cp*) (Cp* = ?5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) derivatives. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the energy difference between the diastereomers is very small, and therefore a mixture of both will be present in solution. The organometallics exhibited varying antiproliferative activity in a series of human cancer cell lines, with the complexes featuring the (R)-enantiomer of the ligand being more potent than the (S)-configured counterparts. Notably, the Rh and Ir complexes demonstrated high KSP inhibitory activity, even at 1 nM concentration, which was independent of the chirality of the ligand, whereas the Ru and especially the Os derivatives were much less active.","output":"Metal-Dependent Cytotoxic and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity of Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir Half-Sandwich Complexes of Ispinesib-Derived Ligands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen A finales de diciembre del 2019, se reportaron una serie de casos de neumona atpica, en ese momento, de origen desconocido en Wuhan, China.

Abstract In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China. Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19. The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.","output":"Pandemia COVID-19, la nueva emergencia sanitaria de preocupacin internacional: una revisin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has affected thousands of people worldwide. To date, vaccines appear to be the only method to prevent and reduce mortality. Four vaccinations have been outwardly approved by European Medicine Agency (EMA) in Europe: BNT162b2 (Comirnaty-BioNTech/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Spikevax-Moderna), ChAdOx1 (VaxzevriaAstrazeneca), and Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen-Johnson&Johnson). After vaccination, local and systemic adverse effects can occur. Cutaneous reactions like urticaria, local injection site pain, morbilliform rash have been documented after vaccination. CASES PRESENTATION: We report four cases of oral erythema multiforme flare arising after BNT162b2 vaccination administration. All the patients denied previous erythema-like and herpetic manifestations history. Two of the reported cases (number 1 and 2) presented with both oral and cutaneous lesions, while cases 3 and 4 showed only oral manifestations. Three of the cases presented the erythema after the first vaccination dosage administration, only one case reported lesions after the second vaccination dosage administration. All the cases were treated with prednisone via oral administration and topical 0.05% clobetasol ointment. CONCLUSIONS: The present reports represent some of the few cases of erythema multiforme occurring as a side effect of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. The causal role of the vaccine for the erythema multiforme has not been proven yet; nevertheless, it is not uncommon for medications to trigger this disease. The vaccine could surface a silent herpes virus infection, which would induce the erythema multiforme instead.","output":"Oral erythema multiforme after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination: a report of four cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT: To study chest computed tomography (CT) findings in family clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Twenty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at the West District Qingdao Municipal Hospital, the Fifth People's Hospital of Qinghai Province and Jiaozhou Central Hospital. Eleven were family clustered cases and 10 were sporadic cases not associated with family gatherings. RESULTS: Ten patients were male and 11 were female. The time elapsed onset of fever and cough to diagnosis was 3 to 7 days. The body temperatures of patients fluctuated between 36.7 and 38.9C. One elderly female patient had no fever. On chest CT, 14 patients with family clustered COVID-19 had bilateral lung lesions. By contrast, 7 patients with no history of familial gatherings showed single lung exudative lesions or consolidation. Seven patients with family clustered COVID-19 had bilateral multiple exudative lesions. Four patients with no history of familial gathering had unilateral lesions. CONCLUSION: Not all patients with COVID-19 have direct epidemiological links to an infected case. They may become infected because of poor protection. In patients with family clustered COVID-19, chest CT often showed multiple exudative lesions in both lungs.

People with Parkinsons Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinsons disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of face mask usage and investigate about different types of face mask and their distribution among pedestrians in southwest Iran during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2020 in Ahvaz, southwest Iran. Using a multistage sampling method, a total of 10440 pedestrians selected from 8 urban districts and 92 neighborhoods of the city. The data gathered by observation method. Percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to describe the variables. Chi-square test, fisher exact test and Chi-square for trend used to assess relationship between two categorical variables. We used unconditional logistic regression model to control confounders. Results: : The mean  SD age of the observed pedestrians was 32.2 15.1 years and 67.9% of them were male. The overall prevalence of face mask usage was 45.6% (95% CI, 44.6 C 46.5). In general, as the age increased, the prevalence of face mask use significantly increased (p for trend <0.001). Women used face masks significantly higher than men (60.2% vs. 38.7%, p <0.001). Among the pedestrians who used the mask, 75.6 % wore facemask correctly. The most common type of facemask used by the pedestrians were surgical(medical) masks (63.8%). In total, the prevalence of facemask usage was significantly higher during a.m. (49.4%) compared to p.m. (43.9%), (p<0.001). Besides, in our study, 1.7% and 0.3 % of Pedestrians had worn gloves and shielded respectively. Women used shields and gloves significantly higher than men (3.6 % vs. 0.7%, p <0.001). Also, women used shields more than men (0.5 % vs. 0.3%, p =0.036). Conclusion: We concluded that the prevalence rate of face mask use in Ahvaz was fairly low especially in men and younger people. Hence, the observed rates probably cannot protect the community against COVID-19 spread. Therefore, it is important to implement educational programs as well as to establish laws and regulations governing the use of face masks in public places.","output":"Face mask use among pedestrians during the COVID-19 pandemic in southwest Iran: An observational study on 10440 people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although it has been more than 40 years since \\"health for all\\" was presented as a focus in the Alma Ata declaration [...].","output":"Progress towards Health for All: Time to End Discrimination and Marginalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a commonly held view that genetically homogenous host populations are more vulnerable to infection than genetically diverse populations.

Although in their professional activity health workers are closely linked to death processes, in recent months, working conditions and health emergencies have drawn an unheard of working scenario, with the stress and anxiety they may suffer when faced with the death of their patients. The present quantitative research was carried out in different hospitals in Spain on health professionals during the month of April 2020. Through the subscale of anxiety in the face of the death of others, developed by Collett-Lester, it has been verified that health professionals have had to develop their work in a context of precariousness, putting at risk both their individual and collective health, notably increasing anxiety in the face of the death of their patients.

Amidst intersecting crises of COVID-19, racism, and police brutality, this report describes survey development and data collection procedures for the SHUR. BASIC PROCEDURES: We conducted focus groups with Black men, Latinxs, and immigrants in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Findings were used to develop and refine measures of conditions salient to the health of urban residents across the country. Quota sampling was employed; oversampling people of color and persons whose usual source of care was not a doctor's office. MAIN FINDINGS: Non-Hispanic Whites made up just under two thirds of the sample (63.65%, n = 2793). Black/African American respondents accounted for 14.2% of the sample (n = 623), while 11.62% (n = 510) were Latinx. Only 43.46% of respondents reported a doctor's office as their usual source of care. Novel measures of population-specific stressors include a range of negative encounters with the police, frequency of these encounters, and respondents' assessments of whether the encounters were necessary. SHUR assessed the likelihood of calling the police if there is a problem, worries about incarceration, and cause-specific stressors such as race-related impression management. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: SHUR (n = 4389) is a useful resource for researchers seeking to address the health implications of experiences not frequently measured by national health surveillance surveys. It includes respondents' zip codes, presenting the opportunity to connect these data with zip code-level health system, social and economic characteristics that shape health beyond individual factors.","output":"Survey of the Health of Urban Residents: a Community-Driven Assessment of Conditions Salient to the Health of Historically Excluded Populations in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As major sport events have been cancelled and postponed in response to COVID-19, the necessity to protect and provide a holistic approach to the professional athlete has never been greater.

The study purpose was to explore posttreatment perspectives of WRGs in a sample of young adult hematologic cancer survivors. METHODS This qualitative descriptive study used social media to recruit eligible cancer survivors (young adults working or in school at the time of cancer diagnosis). Data were collected through telephone semi-structured interviews and analyzed using directed content analysis, followed by thematic content analysis to identify themes. FINDINGS The sample (N = 40) were mostly female (63.5%), White (75%), and diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (57.5%); most worked in professional (40%) or health care (23%) roles. The overarching theme, \\"Survivors' Dilemma,\\" highlights a changed perspective on work-related fulfillment and financial obligations, capturing survivors' decision-making process regarding work. Three subthemes illustrated questions that participants contemplated as they examined how their WRGs had changed: (a) Self-identity: Do I want to do this work?

The aim of this study was to maximise adherence to anti-Covid-19 vaccination in IBD patients. METHODS: In the third trimester of 2020, all IBD patients were informed concerning the need for anti-Covid-19 vaccination and family physicians were advised to proceed with anti-Influenza and anti-pneumococcus vaccinations. Demographic data, disease-related data together with acceptance of vaccinations were recorded. From May 2021, vaccinations of IBD patients were directly arranged at our hospital. We registered performance, procrastination or denial of anti-Covid-19 vaccination, type of vaccine and adverse events. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-three patients were included (Crohns: 266, ulcerative colitis: 257; M/F 289/234; mean age 48  17 years); 53 patients were excluded from analysis as they became infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the study period; overall adherence to vaccination was 400/470 (85%), procrastinators 44 (9%) and 27 patients (6%) refused. Compared with influenza (58%) and pneumococcus (65%) vaccinations, acceptance was higher for anti-Covid-19 vaccination (P < 0.0001, both). Mild adverse events occurred in 31% and two (0.5%) needed precautionary but uneventful hospitalization.

Although respiratory symptoms are most commonly reported, it is important to notice that neurologic complications have been increasingly recognized. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, anosmia, ageusia, and encephalopathy. Demyelinating polyneuropathy presenting as post infectious sequela has not yet been well described. CASE PRESENTATION: Three weeks after being diagnosed with Covid-19, when fully recovered, a 66-year-old man presented with sudden onset walking difficulties owning to symmetric weakness in the lower extremities that rapidly progressed to the upper extremities. Once in respiratory distress with a negative inspiratory force of negative 12, he was intubated due to neuromuscular failure. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was made through clinical evaluation in junction with Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis (revealing albumin-cytological dissociation), electromyography, and magnetic resonance imaging. He had no significant improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin (400mg/kg/day for five days) and, thus, was started on plasmapheresis treatment (five sessions every other day). Although he only had a mild response, the patient was able to answer simple questions and was enrolled in a long-term physical and occupational therapy. DISCUSSION: Guillain-Barre is an immune-mediated disease that affects the peripheral neurons and nerve roots usually after a preceding respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. There are several proposed mechanisms through which Covid-19 can affect the nervous system. It is thought that the virus can enter the cells via an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, invading the peripheral nerve terminals and spreading to the dorsal root ganglion. Then, it potentially shares epitopes similar to neurons, allowing the activation of a cell-mediated immunity leading to neuronal dysfunction. GBS as a sequela of Covid-19 has not been well reported in literature. The case hereby presented had a temporal relationship between the resolution of Covid-19 and the neurologic symptoms. Its rapid progression affecting the peripheral nerves and the albumin-cytological evidence dissociation on CSF analysis led us to consider Guillain-Barre as a strong differential. The poor clinical response despite aggressive treatments is usually associated with a worse prognosis and significant likelihood of reliance on mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: By reporting this case, we aim to reiterate the importance of fully understanding the spectrum of Covid-19 related complications, in order to prevent further mortality.

With no ambitious mitigation, recent years have witnessed an increasing frequency of extreme climate events, including cross-border or borderless climate risks. Accordingly, the Paris Agreement frames adaptation as a global goal and global responsibility. However, financing for adaptation continues to remain extremely poor, relative to the estimated needs, even though the regime has obligatory provisions for support by developed countries. Why is this so? Why should the majority of the countries, with an insignificant contribution to causing the problem, suffer from increasing climate impacts? How can adaptation finance be enhanced at scale? As a response to these queries, the paper substantiates three claims: (1) that poor funding can be attributed to the territorial framing under the regime that conceptualizes adaptation largely as a local or national public good and, hence, the inefficacy of market mechanisms, (2) that it makes conceptual and political sense to consider adaptation as a global public good, and (3) that such a reframing should make a difference in boosting adaptation finance.

This study analyzes state-level geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and age distribution of Obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYNs) to project which US regions will experience a more significant COVID-19 patient burden and provides a guide for vaccine distribution in the OB/GYN workforce. Methods The Association of American Medical Colleges' state-level workforce data is combined with COVID-19 case data reported by Johns Hopkins University. All data and code are available at https://github.com/cxr244/covid-obgyn. Results Our findings illustrate that OB/GYNs in the Midwestern region of the US experience the highest number of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN over 60 years of age: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Idaho have the highest burden of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN, warranting vaccine distribution priority. Additionally, states with the highest proportion of OB/GYNs over the age of 60 like Florida (38%), New Mexico (37%), Alabama (36%), California (36%), and New Jersey (34%), should be strongly considered for priority vaccine allocation, to mitigate predicted OB/GYN workforce shortages. Conclusion When planning and executing vaccine allocation, especially in the early stages of distribution, it is critical to evaluate which communities can benefit the greatest from the limited number of vaccines. A strategy of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to older physicians with a more significant COVID-19 burden can minimize shortages of providers within these states and ensure adequate access to womens healthcare within the communities they serve.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Obstetrician and Gynecologist Workforce Distribution on Vaccine Deployment and Predicting Womens Healthcare Shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ross River virus (RRV) is an endemic Australian arbovirus, and member of the Alphavirus family that also includes Chikungunya virus (CHIK) RRV is responsible for the highest prevalence of human disease cases associated with mosquito-borne transmission in Australia, and has long been a leading suspect in cases of post-viral fatigue syndromes, with extrapolation of this link to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) Research into RRV pathogenesis has revealed a number of immune evasion strategies, impressive for a virus with a genome size of 12 kb (plus strand RNA), which resonate with insights into viral pathogenesis broadly Drawing from observations on RRV immune evasion, mechanisms of relevance to long term idiopathic fatigue are featured as a perspective on infection and eventual ME symptoms, which include considerations of;(1) selective pro-inflammatory gene suppression post antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of RRV infection, (2) Evidence from other virus families of immune disruption and evasion post-ADE, and (3) how virally-driven immune evasion may impact on mitochondrial function via target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes In light of these RRV measures to counter the host immune - inflammatory responses, links to recent discoveries explaining cellular, immune and metabolomic markers of ME will be explored and discussed, with the implications for long-COVID post SARS-CoV-2 also considered Compelling issues on the connections between virally-induced alterations in cytokine expression, for example, will be of particular interest in light of energy pathways, and how these perturbations manifest clinically","output":"Ross River Virus Immune Evasion Strategies and the Relevance to Post-viral Fatigue, and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of oncology consultations have been conducted remotely. The maladaptation or compromise of care could negatively impact oncology patients and their disease management. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the development and implementation process of a web-based, animated patient education tool that supports oncology patients remotely in the context of fewer in-person interactions with health care providers. METHODS: The platform created presents multilingual oncology care instructions. Animations concerning cancer care and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as immunotherapy and chemotherapy guides were the major areas of focus and represented 6 final produced video guides. RESULTS: The videos were watched 1244 times in a period of 6 months. The most watched animation was the COVID-19 & Oncology guide (viewed 565 times), followed by the video concerning general treatment orientations (viewed 249 times) and the video titled \\"Chemotherapy\\" (viewed 205 times). Although viewers were equally distributed among the age groups, most were aged 25 to 34 years (342/1244, 27.5%) and were females (745/1244, 59.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a patient education platform can be designed to prepare patients and their caregivers for their treatment and thus improve outcomes and satisfaction by using a methodical and collaborative approach.

We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban during MT for patients with preceding IVT. Patients and Methods Patients who underwent MT and preceding IVT were derived from the ANGEL registry and were dichotomized into tirofiban and non-tirofiban group according to whether rescue tirofiban was performed. The safety endpoints were sICH, total ICH and distal embolization. The efficacy endpoints were arterial recanalization, three-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]: 0-2) and mortality. Results We included 207 MT patients with preceding IVT from the entire registry. Among them, there were 55 in tirofiban group and 152 in non-tirofiban group, and 17 (8.2%) patients suffered sICH and 36 (17.4%) suffered ICH within 24 hours post-MT; 11 (5.3%) distal embolization of thrombus; 111 (53.6%) achieved functional independence and 34 (16.4%) died after three-month follow-up. No significant differences in safety outcomes on sICH, ICH and distal embolization of thrombus and efficacy outcomes on recanalization and long-term functional independence were found between tirofiban and non-tirofiban group for the entire cohort (p>0.05 for all groups). Tirofiban was correlated with long-term mortality reduction for patients underwent MT and preceding IVT (adjusted hazard ratio 0.28 [0.08-0.94], adjusted p=0.03). Conclusion In AIS patients who underwent MT and preceding IVT, rescue tirofiban was not correlated with increased risk of safety endpoints on sICH, ICH or distal embolization of thrombus, and might be associated with a lower risk of long-term mortality.

Most of the emphasis on its causes has been posed on genetic predisposition, chance, and wrong lifestyles (mainly, obesity and smoking). Moreover, our medical weapons against cancers have not improved too much during the last century, although research is in progress. Once diagnosed with a malignant tumour, we still rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The main problem is that we have focused on fighting a difficult battle instead of preventing it by controlling its triggers. Quite the opposite, our knowledge of the links between environmental pollution and cancer has surged from the 1980s. Carcinogens in water, air, and soil have continued to accumulate disproportionally and grow in number and dose, bringing us to todays carnage. Here, a synthesis and critical review of the state of the knowledge of the links between cancer and environmental pollution in the three environmental compartments is provided, research gaps are briefly discussed, and some future directions are indicated. New evidence suggests that it is relevant to take into account not only the dose but also the time when we are exposed to carcinogens. The review ends by stressing that more dedication should be put into studying the environmental causes of cancers to prevent and avoid curing them, that the precautionary approach towards environmental pollutants must be much more reactionary, and that there is an urgent need to leave behind the outdated petrochemical-based industry and goods production.","output":"Why We Will Continue to Lose Our Battle with Cancers If We Do Not Stop Their Triggers from Environmental Pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The people of rural and periurban India depend on backyard farming system for poultry meat and eggs.

Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID include: persistent viral replication, chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Ongoing vascular endothelial damage promotes platelet adhesion and coagulation, resulting in the impairment of various organ functions. Meanwhile, thrombosis will further aggravate vasculitis contributing to further deterioration. Thus, long COVID is essentially a thrombotic sequela. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for long COVID. This article summarizes the evidence for coagulation abnormalities in long COVID, with a focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various types of cells can carry SARS-CoV-2 through the circulation and attack distant tissues and organs. Furthermore, EVs express tissue factor and phosphatidylserine (PS) which aggravate thrombosis. Given the persistence of the virus, chronic inflammation and endothelial damage are inevitable. Pulmonary structural changes such as hypertension, embolism and fibrosis are common in long COVID. The resulting impaired lung function and chronic hypoxia again aggravates vascular inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. In this article, we also summarize recent research on antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that early anticoagulation can be effective in improving outcomes. In fact, persistent systemic vascular inflammation and dysfunction caused by thrombosis are key factors driving various complications of long COVID. Early prophylactic anticoagulation can prevent the release of or remove procoagulant substances, thereby protecting the vascular endothelium from damage, reducing thrombotic sequelae, and improving quality of life for long-COVID patients.","output":"Long COVID: The Nature of Thrombotic Sequelae Determines the Necessity of Early Anticoagulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) allow entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells and play essential roles in cancer therapy.

Methods: UCSC Xena project, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases (GSE30589 and GSE59185) were searched for gene expression in human tissues, gene expression data, and clinical information. Several bioinformatics methods were utilized to analyze the correlation between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with respect to the prognosis of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). Results: ACE2 expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissue, while its downregulation was associated with low survival in KIRC and KIRP patients. TMPRSS2 was downregulated in KIRC and KIRP, and its expression was not correlated with patient survival. According to clinical risk factor-based prediction models, ACE2 exhibits predictive accuracy for kidney cancer prognosis and is correlated with metabolism and immune infiltration. In an animal model, ACE2 expression was remarkably downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to in the control. Conclusion: ACE2 expression is highly correlated with various metabolic pathways and is involved in immune infiltration.it plays a crucial role than TMPRSS2 in diagnosing and prognosis of kidney cancer patients.

The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the differential predictors of over- and under-responses to COVID-19. METHODS: : A large community sample from the United States and Canada (N=6,854) completed measures of beliefs associated with over- and under-responses, along with measures of distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Over-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs about the dangerousness of COVID-19 (personal health and socio-economic threats) and COVID-19-related xenophobia (beliefs that foreigners are spreading the virus). Under-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and beliefs that one is sufficiently healthy to be robust against the effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: : In regression analyses, medium or large effects were obtained whereby over-response beliefs predicted distress (including distress associated with self-isolation) and excessive avoidance during the pandemic, whereas under-response beliefs predicted the disregard for social distancing. LIMITATIONS: : This study relied on self-reported cross-sectional data and focused on extreme forms of disregard for social distancing guidelines, CONCLUSION: : It is important to understand under-responses to COVID-19 and how these relate to distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing.

This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages. Limitations: Single state study; inability to stratify school age effects by age; cannot account for non-linear growth effects. Conclusion and relevance: In-person primary and secondary school is associated with a statistically significant but proportionally small increase in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 cases.","output":"The effect of in-person primary and secondary school instruction on county-level SARS-CoV-2 spread in Indiana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Competency-based assessment of learners may benefit from a more holistic, inclusive, approach for determining readiness for unsupervised practice. However, despite movements toward greater patient partnership in healthcare generally, inclusion of patients in postgraduate medical learners' assessment is largely absent. METHODS We conducted a scoping review to map the nature, extent and range of literature examining the inclusion (or exclusion) of patients within the assessment of postgraduate medical learners. Guided by Arskey and O'Malley's framework and informed by Levac et al. and Thomas et al., we searched 2 databases (MEDLINE? and Embase?) from inception until February 2021 using subheadings related to assessment, patients and postgraduate learners. Data analysis examined characteristics regarding the nature and factor influencing patient involvement in assessment. RESULTS We identified 41 papers spanning four decades. Some literature suggests patients are willing to be engaged in assessment, however, choose not to engage when for example, language barriers may exist. When stratified by specialty or clinical setting, the influence of factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, or medical condition, seem to remain consistent. Patients may participate in assessment as a standalone group or part of a multisource feedback process. Patients generally provided high ratings but commented on the observed professional behaviors and communication skills in comparison to physicians who focused on medical expertise. CONCLUSION Factors that influence patient involvement in assessment are multifactorial including patients' willingness themselves, language and reading-comprehension challenges and available resources for training programs to facilitate the integration of patient assessments. These barriers however are not insurmountable. While understudied, research examining patient involvement in assessment is increasing; however, our review suggests that the extent which the unique insights will be taken up in postgraduate medical education may be dependent on assessment systems readiness, and in particular, physician readiness to partner with patients in this way.","output":"Patient involvement in assessment of postgraduate medical learners: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a series of four patients with CHD who tested positive for COVID-19, got treated, and underwent cardiac surgery in the same sitting.

The current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers combines a qualitative and quantitative investigation of 160 lectures from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus. These markers could mostly be classified according to their main element into adjective, noun, verb and adverb patterns. Verb patterns were the most common, followed by noun patterns. The verb pattern V clause (e.g., remember slavery had already been legally abolished) and the noun pattern MN v-link (e.g., the point is) are the predominant types of relevance markers. The discrepancy between the prevalent markers and what may be thought of as prototypical or included in EAP textbooks as relevance markers also demonstrates the need for corpus linguistic research.

METHODS: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named EASeL) to construct a large V(NAR) antibody library with a size of 1.2  10(10) from six na?ve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum). RESULTS: The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length V(NAR)s revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical V(NAR) types (Types ICIV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total V(NAR)s could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of V(NAR)s. To validate the use of the shark V(NAR) library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of V(NAR) phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II V(NAR)s were produced in Escherichia coli and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II V(NAR) (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (K(d) = 10.1 nM) for its antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The na?ve nurse shark V(NAR) library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens. The EASeL method may be applicable to the construction of other large diversity gene expression libraries.","output":"Construction and next-generation sequencing analysis of a large phage-displayed V(NAR) single-domain antibody library from six na?ve nurse sharks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rising numbers of patients worldwide, presents an urgent need for effective treatments.

Melting, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, contact angle of molten AuNPs, and phase transition are calculated as indicators of thermodynamic properties of pure and carbon-based AuNPs. Simulation results indicate that the presence of a carbon platform and its contact surface area has a significant role in the thermodynamic properties of AuNPs and leads the phononic heat capacity and thermal conductivity to decrease for AuNPs. The platform also causes the melting point temperature of AuNPs to increase. The melting of gold on the carbon base is of the first-order type.

Chemokines primarily orchestrate leukocyte recruitment to the areas of viral infection, which makes them critical mediators of immune and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated the induction and function of chemokines in mice early after infection with dengue virus in vivo. We found that CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression was rapidly and transiently induced in liver following infection. The expressed CXCL10/IP-10 likely mediates the recruitment of activated NK cells, given that anti-CXCL10/IP-10-treated mice showed diminished NK cell infiltration and reduced hepatic expression of effector molecules in activated NK cells after dengue virus infection. Of particular interest, we found that CXCL10/IP-10 also was able to inhibit viral binding to target cells in vitro. Further investigation revealed that various CXCL10/IP-10 mutants, in which the residues that mediate the interaction between the chemokine and heparan sulfate were substituted, failed to exert the inhibitory effect on dengue binding, which suggests that CXCL10/IP-10 competes with dengue virus for binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface. Moreover, subsequent plaque assays showed that this inhibition of dengue binding blocked viral uptake and replication. The inhibitory effect of CXCL10/IP-10 on the binding of dengue virus to cells may represent a novel contribution of this chemokine to the host defense against viral infection.","output":"Dengue virus induces expression of CXC chemokine ligand 10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, which competitively inhibits viral binding to cell surface heparan sulfate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the association between air pollution and asthma and bronchitis hospital admissions in Algiers city (Algeria).

Despite more water bodies and more fish diversity in the region, fish production and marketing is very low. This review is undertaken to assess the main factors affecting fish production and the marketing chain in Gambella region. Despite the known water and fish potential of the region, fish production is very low. Major factors contributing to a reduction in fish production in the region include inefficient fishing gears, poor transportation access, poor postharvest handling, low price at the landing site, and improper market place. Drying is the predominant postharvest technique and fishing methods are of a subsistence basis. All the fishing activities take place in the natural environment, and aquaculture is not yet established. Enough modern and efficient gears need to be made available. Other modern postharvest handling techniques need to be introduced to ensure a longer shelf life of fish after harvest. Infrastructures need to be constructed to access all water bodies in the region. Because the region has such water resource potential and incredible fish species diversity, the aquaculture needs to be established and popularized.

This study presents a methodological framework for causal inference, using Granger causality analysis, and injury severity classification of traffic crashes, occurring on interstates, with different machine learning techniques including decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network (DNN). The data used in this study were obtained for traffic crashes on all interstates across the state of Texas from a period of six years between 2014 and 2019. The output of the proposed severity classification approach includes three classes for fatal and severe injury (KA) crashes, non-severe and possible injury (BC) crashes, and property damage only (PDO) crashes. While Granger Causality helped identify the most influential factors affecting crash severity, the learning-based models predicted the severity classes with varying performance. The results of Granger causality analysis identified the speed limit, surface and weather conditions, traffic volume, presence of workzones, workers in workzones, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, among others, as the most important factors affecting crash severity. The prediction performance of the classifiers yielded varying results across the different classes. Specifically, while decision tree and random forest classifiers provided the greatest performance for PDO and BC severities, respectively, for the KA class, the rarest class in the data, deep neural net classifier performed superior than all other algorithms, most likely due to its capability of approximating nonlinear models.

We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. METHODS: This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18-20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot-Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). FINDINGS: Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (11 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (62 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 018 (95% CI 011-028; p<0001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 045 [95% CI 032-065]; p<0001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 395 [95% CI 123-667]; p=0004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<00001). INTERPRETATION: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies.

The clinical history, imaging features, procedural complications, pathologic results, imaging follow-up, and clinical outcomes of each case were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 16 patients and 23 biopsy-proven malignant cystic renal lesions were included; two patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome had four and three treated lesions each, and a patient with multiple renal tumors had three treated lesions. The other 13 patients each had a single lesion. Clinical follow-up ranged from 2 to 110 months (average, 24 months). The primary treatment efficacy of RFA was 91% (21/23 lesions), and the secondary treatment efficacy was 96% (22/23 lesions). A minority of patients experienced partial loss of renal function. There were no complications related to bleeding or tumor seeding.

ObjectivesIdentify how common DDIs are between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, common medications, and PIMs in older adults with polypharmacy. Craft anticipatory deprescribing guidance for PIMs that interact with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to help prioritize deprescribing resources, and increase the proportion of older adults potentially benefitting from treatment. DesignIn this secondary analysis, we retrospectively analyzed all patients in the MedSafer cluster randomized deprescribing trial (N=5698 participants) to investigate the proportion of older adults (age >65) with polypharmacy ([]5 usual home medications) who would be ineligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir due to pre-existing DDIs. SettingThe setting of the primary study was in medical inpatient units at 11 Canadian acute care hospitals. ParticipantsHospitalized persons, age 65 years and older, on 5 or more daily home medications, with an expected survival of 3 months or longer were included in this secondary analysis. Main outcomes and measuresWe identified the prevalence of (PIMs), as defined by the MedSafer software. We then developed deprescribing guidance, so clinicians could proactively deprescribe in an effort to increase the proportion of older adults eligible for safe treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in the event of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsOf 5698 participants, a total of 3869 (68%) were taking a medication with a known nirmatrelvir-ritonavir DDI, and of these 823 (21%) had at least one PIM. Of 823 PIMs, 627 (76%) were medications with a known high risk DDI and 213 (26%) were considered moderate risk DDIs with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Many of the PIMs required \\"advanced deprescribing\\" and could not simply be stopped, held, or adjusted at the time of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir receipt. Conclusions and relevanceOlder adults are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Deprescribing PIMs in advance of a COVID-19 infection could increase the proportion of older adults who can safely receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, in addition to the usual benefits observed with medication management. Impact StatementWe certify that this work is novel. This timely clinical investigation explores the unforeseen consequences of polypharmacy and the use of potentially inappropriate medication in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. This manuscript addresses the many drug-drug interactions between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, an antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and potentially inappropriate medications in older adults with polypharmacy from the MedSafer cluster randomized trial.

This suggests a certain reciprocity in our relations with both humans and nonhumans. In his The Visible and the Invisible, Merleau-Ponty introduces the notion of the flesh to capture this reciprocity. Building on this idea, he proposes to understand our relationships with other humans, as well as those with nonhuman beings as having a chiasmic structure: to sense, or perceive another entity in a particular way simultaneously implies to be sensed or perceived in a particular way by this other entity. In this paper, we show how a postphenomenological perspective expands on Merleau-Ponty: first, it more radically interprets Merleau-Pontys notion of flesh by not only considering it to be a medium that is the condition of possibility for vision but as pointing to the constitution of an intercorporeal field in which entitiesboth human and nonhumanmutually sense one another. Second, it augments Merleau-Pontys thought by drawing attention to how technologies mediate chiasmic relations. This is clarified through the example of the facemask, which (1) reveals the chiasmic structure of our relation with nonhuman entities, and (2) shows that technologies co-constitute interpersonal relationships by making humans present to one another in a particular way. We suggest that these aspects are not unique to the facemask, but point to a general technologically mediated chiasmic structure of human-world relations.","output":"Living in the Flesh: Technologically Mediated Chiasmic Relationships (in Times of a Pandemic)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The far-reaching effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have crippled the progress of the world today.

Here, in this article, we hypothesize that there are three possible peptide vaccine regions that can be targeted to prevent the surge of SARS-CoV-2. The candidates that were selected, were surface-exposed and were not sequestered by any neighbouring amino acids. They were also found to be capable of generating both B-cell and T-cell immune responses.

We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest.

More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence/credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches.

We aimed to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patient's condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW? environment that can provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidence that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study.

NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). PGE(2), one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE(2) receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to infection.

Since cytokine storm is likely a cause of AKI and glomerular disease, we investigated the two major transcription factors, STAT3 and NF-kB, which are known to be activated by cytokines. METHODS: This is an observational study of the postmortem kidneys of 50 patients who died with COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai Hospital during the first pandemic surge. All samples were reviewed under light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence by trained renal pathologists. In situ hybridization evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 and immunostaining of transcription factors STAT3 and NF-kB were performed. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, acute tubular injury was the major pathological finding, together with global or focal glomerulosclerosis. We were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. ACE2 expression was reduced in the tubular cells of patients who died with COVID-19 and did not co-localize with TMPRSS2. SARS-CoV-2 was identified occasionally in the mononuclear cells in the peritubular capillary and interstitium. STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 was increased in 2 cases in the glomeruli and in 3 cases in the tubulointerstitial compartments. Interestingly, STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 increased in 9 cases but only in the tubulointerstitial compartment. A significant increase in NF-kB phosphorylation at Ser276 was also found in the tubulointerstitium of the two patients with increased p-STAT3 (Tyr705).

After residents settled and further explanation of the study given (approximately 15 min), measurements included: tympanic membrane temperature, thermal sensation rating and infrared thermal mapping of non-dominant hand and forearm. Sixty-nine afebrile adults (60C101 years of age) were studied in groups of two to five, in mean ambient temperatures of 21.4C26.6 C (median 23.6 C). Significant differences were observed between groups; thermal sensation rating (p = 0.02), tympanic temperature (p = 0.01), fingertip skin temperature (p = 0.01) and temperature gradients; fingertip-wrist p = 0.001 and fingertip-distal forearm, p = 0.001.

We studied the use of Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor cerebral regional oxygenation tissue saturation (rSO2) and its relation to ABI in VA-ECMO. In this prospective, observational cohort study of 39 consecutive patients, we analyzed the ability of rSO2 values from continuous bedside NIRS monitoring to predict ABI during VA-ECMO support. ABI occurred in 24 (61.5%) patients. Those with ABI had a lower pre-ECMO Glasgow Coma Scale, more blood product transfusions of pRBCs and FFP, and higher APACHEII score. Baseline rSO2 values were not significantly different between cohorts (54.25 vs 58.50, p = 0.260), while the minimum rSO2 value was lower for patients who experienced an ABI than those who did not (39.75 vs 44.50, p = 0.039). In patients with ABI, 21 (87.5%) had a drop in rSO2 of 25% from baseline, compared to only 7 (46.7%) patients without ABI (p = 0.017). By ROC analysis, we found that desaturations with >25% drop from the baseline rSO2 on VA-ECMO exhibited 86% sensitivity and 55% specificity to predict ABI, with an area under the curve of 0.68. Patients with ABI were more likely to have withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (17 vs 5, p = 0.049), while neurologic outcome and mortality were not statistically different between patients with or without ABI. Our results support that cerebral NIRS is a useful, real-time bedside neuromonitoring tool to detect ABI in VA-ECMO patients. A >25% drop from the baseline was sensitive in predicting ABI occurrence.

Most patients who need intensive care due to COVID-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and patients need long-term mechanical ventilation. This situation increases the risk of dysphagia, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia in patients. Information about COVID-19-associated dysphagia is still limited. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the frequency of postextubation dysphagia (PED) and its effect on clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: Patients with COVID-19 in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) who were left on a mechanical ventilator for at least 24 h and are extubated were retrospectively screened. Gugging swallowing screen (GUSS) test was performed 24 h after extubation to evaluate swallowing function. Patients were examined in two groups as with and without dysphagia. Results: This study included 40 patients who were followed up on a mechanical ventilator and extubated due to COVID-19. According to the bedside GUSS test results, patients were divided into two groups as dysphagia group (n=24) and the non-dysphagia group (n=16). The mean age was higher in the dysphagia group (p<0.001). Re-intubation rate and ICU, and in-hospital mortality were higher in the dysphagia group (p<0.001 for all), whereas the length of stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation time were longer (p=0.005 and p=0.001). ICU mortality was higher in patients with severe dysphagia (p=0.026). Conclusion: Our study revealed that the risk of PED increased with the age of patients with COVID-19 and PED increased the incidence of re-intubation, which was an important prognostic parameter that indicates mortality. Recognizing dysphagia with the early evaluation of swallowing in extubated patients with COVID-19 diagnosis is important to minimize the risk of aspiration pneumonia with proper nutrition, reduce the increased health cost, and prevent poor clinical outcomes. ? 2021 by Turkish Neurological Society.","output":"Post-extubation Dysphagia and COVID-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection of poultry with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) is often associated with mild respiratory symptoms but may also lead to loss in egg production in laying birds. In vivo susceptibility of the reproductive tract for LPAIV infection was reported for turkeys and chickens, but virus-interaction with epithelial cells of the oviduct and possible stimulation of the local antiviral immune responses have not been characterized. In this study, we wanted to investigate the suitability of magnum organ cultures (MOC) as an in vitro model to study virus-host interactions. We compared the susceptibility of duck (Du), chicken (Ch), and turkey (Tu) MOC for three different influenza A viruses (IAV). Overall, the course of infection and the antiviral immune response varied between strains as well as host cell origin, but MOC gave reproducible results for all investigated parameters within each species. While pandemic (p) H1N1 and H9N2 efficiently replicated in MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu, MOC-Du were significantly less susceptible to infection as indicated by a reduced replication level for both viruses (p < 0.05). Overall, virus replication levels did not correlate with interferon (IFN) mRNA-expression levels in neither species. H9N2-infection led to a significant upregulation of interferon (IFN) mRNA expression in MOC of all species compared to the non-infected controls (p < 0.05), while a correlation with replication levels was only seen for MOC-Tu. pH1N1-infection induced only significant upregulation of IFN mRNA expression in MOC-Tu at 48 hours post infection (p < 0.05), but the expression pattern did not correlate with replication levels. Our results show that MOC are a suitable model to study IAV-interaction with the mucosal surface of the avian reproductive tract.

From published sources we estimated dietary energy available from the major domains of food exports, with adjustments for wastage. We specifically considered a severe case nuclear winter model by Xia et al (2021) ie, 150 Tg of soot ejected into the stratosphere. We found that the current NZ population has an estimated dietary energy intake of 44.4 billion kJ per day (8686 kJ per person per day). Current major food exports are equivalent to 3.9 times this amount ie, 34,100 kJ (8150 kcal) per person per day. Exported dairy products were estimated to be able to provide 338% of all the current dietary energy, followed by exports of: meat (34%); fruit (8.6%), alcohol (4.8%), marine products (4.6%), and vegetables (2.7%). After a severe case nuclear winter scenario that reduced food production by 58%, there would still be 1.7 times current daily intakes available from diverted exported foods (or 14,321 kJ [3423 kcal] per person per day). In conclusion, this country appears to have excess food production capacity even after a severe case nuclear winter scenario that more than halved food production.

Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors -in agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell interaction.","output":"Mechanobiology predicts raft formations triggered by ligand-receptor activity across the cell membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing countries and patent offices have shown differing approaches to patent specification disclosure requirements and benefit sharing.","output":"Patent protection and access to genetic resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients who are undocumented immigrants (UIs) frequently present to emergency departments in the United States, especially in communities with large immigrant populations.

The self-forming magnet (SFM) device is a type of compression anastomosis device used to safely and effectively create an end-to-end small bowel anastomosis without the localized inflammatory response seen with sutures or staples, as no foreign bodies are left behind. METHODS A Good Laboratory Practice preclinical study using a porcine model to evaluate creating an in vivo anastomosis via magnetic compression between two segments of small bowel (jejunum or ileum) was performed. Magnetic anastomoses were compared to stapled and handsewn anastomoses. Six animals were used for the magnetic anastomosis and eight for the two control groups for a total of 14 subjects. RESULTS Mean creation times were 17.1 min (SD 6.06) for the SFM group, 10.3 min (SD 6.55, CI 95%) for the stapled anastomosis group, and 28.3 min (SD 2.63, CI 95%) for the suture anastomosis group, with a statistically significant difference among groups (p < 0.0021).

The biomarkers were selected by the group comparison of patients stool samples with different treatment responses (47 responders vs 55 non-responders, 102 metagenomes). Selected biomarkers were verified using the available data describing the influence of the fecal microbiota transplantation on melanoma immunotherapy outcomes (9 donors, 6 responders, 19 non-responders, 256 metagenomes). According to our analysis, the resulting cross-study reproducible taxonomic biomarkers correspond to 12 Firmicutes, 4 Bacteroidetes, and 3 Actinobacteria. 140 gene groups were identified as reproducible functional biomarkers, including those potentially involved in production of immune-stimulating molecules and metabolites. In addition, we ranked taxonomic biomarkers by the number of functional biomarkers found in their metagenomic context. In other words, we predicted a list of the potential most beneficial bacteria for a positive response to melanoma immunotherapy. The obtained results can be used to make recommendations for the gut microbiota correction in cancer immunotherapy, and the resulting list of biomarkers can be considered for potential diagnostic ways for predicting melanoma immunotherapy outcome.

RESULTS: Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness 5 days. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness 5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based evaluation of COVID-19: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test accuracy study & its implications for COVID-19 management in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater settled solids correlate well with COVID-19 incidence rates (IRs). Here, we develop distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate IRs using concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater solids and investigate the impact of sampling frequency on model performance. SARS-CoV-2 N gene and PMMoV RNA concentrations were measured daily at four wastewater treatment plants in California. Artificially reduced datasets were produced for each plant with sampling frequencies of once every 2, 3, 4, and 7 days. Sewershed-specific models that related daily N/PMMoV to IR were fit for each sampling frequency with data from mid-Nov 2020 through mid-July 2021, which included the period of time during which Delta emerged. Models were used to predict IRs during a subsequent out-of-sample time period. When sampling occurred at least once every 4 days, the in- and out-of-sample root mean square error (RMSE) changed less than 7 cases/100,000 compared to daily sampling across sewersheds. This work illustrates that real-time, daily predictions of IR are possible with small error, despite changes in circulating variants, when sampling frequency is once every 4 days or more. However, reduced sampling frequency may not serve other important wastewater surveillance use cases.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater settled solids surveillance frequency and impact on predicted COVID-19 incidence using a distributed lag model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The current COVID-19 pandemic has proposed challenges to urology residency programs all over the nation, resulting in alterations in surgical volumes and academic curriculums. In this review, we propose a structured academic outline allowing for the preservation of the academic vitality. Additionally, we offer a model that optimizes resident coverage at hospitals, the preservation of surgical skills, and the designation of daily reserves as the pandemic worsens. RECENT FINDINGS Currently, there is no structured framework for urology residency programs to adhere to in the face of a global pandemic or natural disaster. Urologic surgical emergencies arise and exceptional urologic care must continue to be provided. Despite lower surgical volumes and the inability for teams to meet in person, there are still robust opportunities for urologic surgical residents and faculty to maintain their surgical skills and mental sharpness. Changes within the medical field are already beginning to take shape, especially related to telehealth and virtual learning.

Re-configuring a hospital clinical rotation using virtual care platforms allowed students to re-engage in the clinical environment and actively participate in patient care. METHODS: During the height of the pandemic, we implemented a 4-week virtual team member (VTM) inpatient medicine elective for medical students in their second year and above to participate in acute patient care during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tasks included providing daily updates to patients and family members along and care coordination. Faculty experts in infectious disease, mental health, ethics, and patient safety incorporated weekly didactic video talks throughout the elective. Student feedback was obtained anonymously through pre-, mid-, and post-elective questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 26 students enrolled in the two 4-week blocks, with 85% in the 2nd year. Survey response rates for the pre, mid, and post-rotation questionnaires were 96%, 77%, 58% respectively. Of the 15 students who completed the post-survey, the majority strongly and somewhat agreed that the elective met expectations (12/15, 80%), was worthwhile (14/15, 93%) and met goals (12/15, 80%). Best parts of the elective most frequently cited by students were patient care and teamwork. Working remotely was the greatest challenge.

Crowdworking is an alternative to expensive expert labour. Annotation corresponds to diagnosis, so comparing unlabeled records to labeled ones seems more appropriate for crowdworkers without medical expertise. We modeled the comparison of a record to two other records as a triplet annotation task, and we conducted an experiment to investigate to what extend sensor-measured stress, task duration, uncertainty of the annotators and agreement among the annotators could predict annotation correctness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an annotation experiment on health data from a population-based study. The triplet annotation task was to decide whether an individual was more similar to a healthy one or to one with a given disorder. We used hepatic steatosis as example disorder, and described the individuals with 10 pre-selected characteristics related to this disorder. We recorded task duration, electro-dermal activity as stress indicator, and uncertainty as stated by the experiment participants (n = 29 non-experts and three experts) for 30 triplets. We built an Artificial Similarity-Based Annotator (ASBA) and compared its correctness and uncertainty to that of the experiment participants. RESULTS: We found no correlation between correctness and either of stated uncertainty, stress and task duration. Annotator agreement has not been predictive either. Notably, for some tasks, annotators agreed unanimously on an incorrect annotation. When controlling for Triplet ID, we identified significant correlations, indicating that correctness, stress levels and annotation duration depend on the task itself. Average correctness among the experiment participants was slightly lower than achieved by ASBA. Triplet annotation turned to be similarly difficult for experts as for non-experts. CONCLUSION: Our lab experiment indicates that the task of triplet annotation must be prepared cautiously if delegated to crowdworkers. Neither certainty nor agreement among annotators should be assumed to imply correct annotation, because annotators may misjudge difficult tasks as easy and agree on incorrect annotations. Further research is needed to improve visualizations for complex tasks, to judiciously decide how much information to provide, Out-of-the-lab experiments in crowdworker setting are needed to identify appropriate designs of a human-annotation task, and to assess under what circumstances non-human annotation should be preferred.","output":"Assessing the difficulty of annotating medical data in crowdworking with help of experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of fresh whole blood (FWB) and blood component transfusion in improving clinical outcome and serological parameters in the early postoperative period following spinal deformity surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing major spinal deformity surgeries involving  6 levels of fusion and expected blood loss  750 ml between September 2017 and August 2018 were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: FWBG and CG, receiving fresh whole blood and component transfusions, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients with spinal deformities of different etiologies were included. The mean age was 14.0 and 14.9 years in FWB and CG, respectively. All other preoperative parameters were comparable. The mean fusion levels and surgical time were 11.1 and 221.20 min in FWB, as compared with 10.70 and 208.74minutes in CG, respectively. Intraoperative blood losses were 929 ml (FWBG) and 847 ml(CG), and the mean volumes of transfusion were 1.90 (FWBG) and 1.65 units (CG). FWBG was significantly superior to CG in the following clinical and laboratory parameters: duration of oxygen dependence [36.43 (FWBG) vs. 43.45 h (CG); P = 0.0256], mean arterial pH [7.442 (FWBG) vs. 7.394 (CG); p < 0.001], interleukin-6 [30.04 (FWBG) vs. 35.10 (CG); p < 0.019], mean duration of HDU stay [40.6 hours (FWBG) vs 46.51 hours (CG); p = 0.0234] and postoperative facial puffiness [7/30 in FWBG vs. 18/35 (CG) (P < 0.02)]. CONCLUSION: FWB transfusion can potentially improve the immediate postoperative outcome in patients undergoing major spinal deformity surgeries by reducing the duration of intensive care unit stay and oxygen dependence. The other potential benefits of this practice, based on our study, include a reduced inflammatory response (reduced lactate and IL-6) and postoperative facial puffiness. However, further large-scale validation studies in future are necessary to precisely determine the role of FWB in spine surgeries.

SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface and this complex is internalized. ACE2 serves as an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory signals associated with four major regulator systems: the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the complement system, the coagulation cascade, and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Understanding the pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 on these pathways is needed, particularly given the current lack of proven, effective treatments. The vasoconstrictive, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory conditions induced by SARS-CoV-2 can be ascribed, at least in part, to the activation of these intersecting physiological networks. Moreover, patients with immune deficiencies, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and kidney disease often have altered activation of these pathways, either due to underlying disease or to medications, and may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Certain characteristic COVID-associated skin, sensory, and central nervous system manifestations may also be linked to viral activation of the RAAS, complement, coagulation, and KKS pathways.

Accessibility restriction measures adopted by many countries were a fast and useful response to contain the spread of the virus. Within this topic, the aim of this paper was to support policies and decision makers in the definition of the most appropriate strategies for managing the Covid-19 crisis. Precisely the correlation between the Covid-19 positive cases and the transport accessibility of an area was investigated through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results show that the transport accessibility was the variable that better explained the number of Covid-19 infections (about 40% in weight), meaning that greater is the accessibility of a territorial area, easier the virus reaches its population. Furthermore, other context variables were also significant, i.e. socio-economic, territorial and pollutant variables. Estimated findings underline how the accessibility, that often measures the wealth of a territory, becomes the worst enemy of a territorial area during a pandemic, resulting the main vehicle of contagion among the citizens. These results are original and would allow to define possible policies and/or best practices to better manage mobility restrictions. The quantitative estimations performed show that a possible and probably more sustainable policy for containing social interactions could be to apply lockdowns proportionally to the transport accessibility of the areas, in the sense that greater the accessibility is, greater the mobility restrictive policies must be adopted.","output":"The role of transport accessibility within the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have shaped the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health discourse around effective control measures.

Methods: This is prospective single center observational study conducted between January 1st, 2022 until February 28th, 2022. Patients were recruited at the time of attendance at the infusion center. Eligibility criteria included patients with confirmed diagnosis of IBD who are receiving infliximab with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and have received two or three-dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients were excluded if they were infected or had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 previously since the start of the pandemic or received other vaccines than the BNT162b2. Our primary outcome was the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies 40-45 weeks from the first dose of BNT162b2 in patients with IBD receiving infliximab combination therapy. Medians with interquartile range (IQR) were calculated. Results: 162 patients with IBD and receiving infliximab combination therapy were recruited and the number of patients in each group was 81.

Due to the improved prenatal diagnostic modalities, the diagnosis of cardiac disease is increasing in newborns. Fetal echocardiography is considered a good and accurate diagnostic method for congenital heart disease. Objective To study the common indications of fetal echocardiography and the detection of congenital heart disease in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method In this hospital-based, retrospective study, we reviewed medical records of 324 fetuses who were indicated for fetal echocardiography at Dhulikhel Hospital over 24 months period of time (September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2019). Result The mean age of pregnant women at presentation for fetal echocardiography was 30.7  4.7 years. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 28.9  4.9 weeks. Among all the pregnant women, 208 (65%) presented during the second trimester and 112 (35%) presented during the third trimester. Maternal indications for fetal echocardiography were seen in48.12% cases, whereas fetal indications were seen in 42.81% cases. The most common indication was for maternal gestational diabetes (30.31%). Among the 324fetal echocardiography results, 65.43% cases had normal findings, echogenic intra-cardiac foci were seen in 18.82% and significant abnormal findings were seen in 15.74% of cases. Among all women having maternal indication for echocardiography, 34 (22.07%) fetus had some form of abnormal findings, whereas only 17 (12.40%) fetus with fetal indication showed abnormal findings (p < 0.05). Conclusion Indication of fetal echocardiography is increasing and can be a good diagnostic tool to improve prognosis and outcome of a newborn. It has become widely used in pediatric cardiology.

Although it is well known that a balanced diet which satisfies the daily intake of vitamin C positively affects the immune system and reduces susceptibility to infections, available data do not support the theory that oral vitamin C supplements boost immunity. No current clinical recommendations support the possibility of significantly decreasing the risk of respiratory infections by using high-dose supplements of vitamin C in a well-nourished general population. Only in restricted subgroups (e.g., athletes or the military) and in subjects with a low plasma vitamin C concentration a supplementation may be justified. Furthermore, in categories at high risk of infection (i.e., the obese, diabetics, the elderly, etc.), a vitamin C supplementation can modulate inflammation, with potential positive effects on immune response to infections. The impact of an extra oral intake of vitamin C on the duration of a cold and the prevention or treatment of pneumonia is still questioned, while, based on critical illness studies, vitamin C infusion has recently been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients.

However, the process from CSCs to invasion cells is unconfirmed. METHODS: Several bioinformatics methods, including clustering, pseudotime analysis, gene set variation analysis and gene ontology enrichment, were used to construct a path of gradual transformation of CSCs to invasive cells, called stem-to-invasion path. A large amount of signaling interactions were collated to build the multilayer regulatory network. KaplanCMeier curve and time-dependent ROC method were applied to reveal prognostic values. RESULTS: We validated the heterogeneity of cells in the tumor microenvironment and revealed the presence of malignant epithelial cells with high invasive potential within primary colonic carcinomas. Next, the stem-to-invasion path was identified through constructing a branching trajectory with cancer cells arranged in order. A multilayer regulatory network considered as the vital factor involved in acquiring invasion characteristics underlying the path was built to elucidate the interactions between tumor cell and tumor-associated microenvironment. Then we further identified a novel combinatorial biomarker that can be used to assess the prognosis for CRC patients, and validated its predictive robustness on the independent dataset. CONCLUSION: Our work provides new insights into the acquisition of invasive potential in primary tumor cells, as well as potential therapeutic targets for CRC invasiveness, which may be useful for the cancer research and clinical treatment.

We further observe that the effect of bank globalization is dependent on the regulatory and institutional regimes of the respective host (home) countries. Specifically, stringent activity restrictions, tight supervision, fewer limitations on foreign banks, lower market entry barriers, and less government interference all help mitigate the efficiency loss from foreign bank entry. Less supervision power, multiple supervisors, more restrictions on foreign banks, and a competitive banking market are all conducive to the higher efficiency gain of incumbent domestic banks from the respective countrys outward investments in the banking sector. Moreover, we find that the adverse impact on efficiency from foreign bank presence is less pronounced for less risky, more profitable, and larger banks, while banks that are more efficient, more profitable, taking on more risk, and/or smaller gain more efficiency from their countrys foreign expansion.","output":"Bank globalization and efficiency: Host- and home-country effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has been identified to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China and spread across the world.

Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000).

A total of 32 of these institutions agreed to participate in this survey. Patients who had undergone surgery between January 2008 and March 2014 were included in the present study. RESULTS Overall, 1145 cases of laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port surgery were recorded during the study period. The most frequent procedures were adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy. Laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port surgery represented 12% (872/7311) of all laparoscopic procedures carried out at participating institutions. The number of patients who underwent pyeloplasty, donor nephrectomy and simple nephrectomy tended to increase, whereas those who underwent adrenalectomy, radical nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy peaked in 2012, and then tended to decrease in 2013.

We analyzed and compared the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and radiological features of two independent cohorts of patients diagnosed with either COVID-19 (n=36) or adenovirus pneumonia (n=18). RESULTS: COVID-19 did not show a preference in males or females, whereas 94.4% of patients with adenovirus pneumonia were males. Fever and cough were common in both COVID-19 and adenovirus pneumonia. But the median maximal body temperature of the adenovirus pneumonia cohort was significantly higher than in COVID-19 (P<0.001). Furthermore, 77.8% of patients with adenovirus pneumonia had a productive cough versus only 13.9% of COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Compared with adenovirus pneumonia, constitutional symptoms were less common in COVID-19, including headache (16.7% vs 38.9%, P=0.072), sore throat (8.3% vs 27.8%, P=0.058), myalgia (8.3% vs 61.1%, P<0.001) and diarrhea (8.3% vs 44.4%, P=0.002). Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 were less likely to develop respiratory failure (8.3% vs 83.3%, P<0.001) and showed less prominent laboratory abnormalities, including lymphocytopenia (61.1% vs 88.9%, P=0.035), thrombocytopenia (2.8% vs 61.1%, P<0.001), elevated procalcitonin (2.8% vs 77.8%, P<0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (36.1% vs 100%, P<0.001). Besides, a higher percentage of patients with adenovirus pneumonia showed elevated transaminase, myocardial enzymes, creatinine and D-dimer compared with COVID-19 patients. On chest CT, the COVID-19 cohort was characterized by peripherally distributed ground-glass opacity and patchy shadowing, while the adenovirus pneumonia cohort frequently presented with consolidation and pleural effusion.

Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of descontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light dosage varies significantly on different respirator angles, and propose a method to descontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm, and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the dosage received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the luminaires plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance, angle of incidence of the light source.

The aim of the current study was to examine whether bronchial suction could also facilitate lung collapse when using a double-lumen tube (DLT). Methods Eighty patients scheduled for elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer using a DLT for one-lung ventilation (OLV) were randomised into an arm that received bronchial suction and an arm that underwent spontaneous collapse (n=40 per arm). For bronchial suction, a pressure of -30 cmH2O was applied to the lumen of the non-ventilated lung during the first minute of OLV. The primary endpoint was the degree of lung collapse at 10 min after the start of OLV, assessed on a 10-point visual analogue scale (0: fully inflated; 10: complete collapse). Secondary outcomes included lung collapse at 1 and 5 min after the start of OLV, as well as occurrence of intraoperative hypoxemia. Results Median (interquartile range) lung collapse scores at 10 min were statistically greater in the bronchial suction arm than in the spontaneous collapse arm [9.0 (9.0-9.0) vs. 8.5 (8.0-9.0); P=0.004].

In this study, we aim to estimate the rate of change in average daily travel distance from a participant's registered address before and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Method: Participants were recruited into Virus Watch starting in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants and vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onwards. Between September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch participants to contribute towards our tracker sub-cohort which uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect data on movement. We used segmented linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Results: We analysed the daily travel distance of 228 vaccinated adults. Between 157 days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 8.9km (IQR: 3.50km, 24.17km). Between the day of vaccination and 100 days after vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 10.30km (IQR: 4.11, 27.53km). Between 157 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, there was a daily median decrease in mobility of 40m (95%CI: -51m, -31m, p-value <0.001) per day. After the removal of outlier data, and between the vaccination date and 99 days after vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of 45.0m (95%CI: 25m, 65m, p-value = <0.001). Restricting the analysis to the 3rd national lockdown (4th of January 2021 to the 5th of April 2021), we found a median daily movement increase of 9m (95%CI: -25m, 45m, p = 0.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, and a median daily movement increase of 10m (95%CI: -60m, 94m, p-value = 0.69) in the 30 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting high volume geolocation data as part of research projects, and the utility of these for understanding public health issues. Our results are consistent with both an increase and decrease in movement after vaccination and suggest that, amongst Virus Watch participants, any changes in movement distances post-vaccination are small.","output":"Changes in mobility pre and post first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: findings from a prospective community cohort study including GPS movement tracking in England and Wales (Virus Watch)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The large global burden of viral infections and especially the rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases and other emerging viral diseases show the need for new approaches in vaccine development. Several new vaccine technology platforms have been developed and are under evaluation. Areas covered: This article discusses the measles vector platform technology derived from the safe and highly efficacious measles virus vaccine. The pipeline of measles-vectored vaccine candidates against viral diseases is reviewed. Particular focus is given to the Chikungunya vaccine candidate as the first measles-vectored vaccine that demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and functionality of the technology in humans even in the presence of pre-existing anti-measles immunity and thus achieved proof of concept for the technology. Expert commentary: Demonstrating no impact of pre-existing anti-measles immunity in humans on the response to the transgene was fundamental for the technology and indicates that the technology is suitable for large-scale immunization in measles pre-immune populations. The proof of concept in humans combined with a large preclinical track record of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for a variety of pathogens suggest the measles vector platform as promising plug-and-play vaccine platform technology for rapid development of effective preventive vaccines against viral and other infectious diseases.","output":"Measles-vectored vaccine approaches against viral infections: a focus on Chikungunya."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes an interaction concept for persons with visual impairments to explore digital maps.

Between April and August of 2020, the mean monthly COVID-19 case ratio for ICE detainees was 13.4 times that of the general U.S. population. This study aims to understand the experiences of detained asylum seekers during the pandemic and to provide insight into COVID-19's impact on this population's health. This qualitative study employed first-person, in-depth narratives obtained from 12 asylum seekers, all of whom were detained in immigration detention centers or prisons during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and were subsequently released. Detained asylum seekers reported inadequate medical care, obstacles to receiving care, an inability to social distance, poor hygiene, restricted movement, and a lack of infection control-- all which increased their risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 and exacerbated health inequalities brought to the forefront by the pandemic. Advocating for improved disease prevention and screening, prompt access to health care and treatment, cohorting of infectious cases, and community alternatives to detention to decrease the detained immigrant population sizes are crucial to halt communicability of the virus and its subsequent morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.","output":"The impact of immigration detention on the health of asylum seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCov), we established an prediction model to predict the number of diagnoses case in China except Hubei Province.

However, little research exists on inequities in telehealth utilization among the pediatric population. This study examines disparities in telehealth utilization in a population of publicly insured children. This observational, retrospective study used administrative data from Alabama's stand-alone Children's Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids. Rates of any telehealth use for March to December 2020 were examined. In addition-to capture lack of health care utilization-rates of having no medical claims were examined and compared with March to December 2019 and 2018. Multinomial logit models were estimated to investigate how telehealth use and having no medical claims (reference category: having medical claims but no telehealth) were associated with race/ethnicity, rural-urban residence, and family income. Of the 106,478 enrollees over March to December 2020, 13.4% had any telehealth use and 24.7% had no medical claims. The latter was greater than no medical claims in 2019 (19.5%) and 2018 (20.7%). Black and Hispanic children had lower odds of any telehealth use (odds ratio [OR]: 0.81, P < 0.01; OR: 0.68, P < 0.01) and higher odds of no medical claims (OR: 1.11, P < 0.05; OR: 1.73, P < 0.05) than non-Hispanic White children. Rural residents had lower odds of telehealth use than urban residents. Those in the highest family income-based fee group had higher odds of telehealth use than the lowest family income-based fee group.

Within 10 days of identification of the first healthcare worker infection, both hospitals had closed, and all patients were discharged or decanted to other facilities within the state. The entire hospital staff (approximately 1300 people) and their households (approximately 3000-4000 people) were furloughed for 14 days to halt the spread of infection. During the furlough period, a decommissioning, terminal clean and recommissioning process was undertaken alongside recovery and reorientation of the workforce to personal protective equipment. Within 4 days of closure, an Australian Defence Force and Australian Medical Assistance Team team opened the prioritised emergency department to provide emergency care for the local community, supported by modified diagnostic services. The decommissioning and cleaning rolled on over the ensuing month, in a predetermined priority order. As staff returned from quarantine, they recommissioned their clinical areas.

The rapid growth of the internet has ushered in an era of big data and the rational use of the internet. Meanwhile, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, onsite education has been forced to adapt to online programs, including the health education of GDM. Methods: We developed an innovative mobile application (app) that combines a teaching model of the flipped classroom and GDM management, which allows pregnant women to learn knowledge about GDM and prevent GDM to a certain degree. It turns passive learners into active learners, leads them to preview before class, and takes the lead in the classroom, mobilizing learners' enthusiasm to achieve good teaching results. Results: The implementation of the online gestational diabetes flipped classroom is an innovative attempt in this field. The described approach is especially relevant in the context of the ongoing global pandemic, accelerates knowledge transfer, improves patients' learning motivation, has a health promotion effect, and boosts patients' self-management efficiency. This app can overcome the treatment barriers for those patients that cannot go to the hospital, enhance health promotion efforts, and improve GDM management.

Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020.

The right to perform preventive examinations using ICT should not be identified with an absolute obligation in this respect. An occupational medicine doctor may refuse to perform a preventive examination remotely if the specificity of medical activities and patient safety require personal contact with the doctor. The state of the epidemic prompted the legislator to adopt solutions enabling employees to continue working on the basis of an invalid decision, provided that it expired after March 7, 2020. The obligation to perform preventive examinations has been suspended, as a result of which their conduction during the epidemic is pointless. However, the obligations of the employee and the employer must be fulfilled in this respect immediately, but not later than within 60 days from the date of the epidemic cancellation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study uses the method of analyzing the currently applicable legal provisions allowing the use of ICT in the provision of health services. In addition, regulations governing the possibility of obliging employees to work remotely during the epidemic were also analyzed, together with the non-performance of preventive examinations and admissibility of work under a decision which had expired before March 7, 2020. RESULTS Current legal regulations are ambiguous and cause interpretation difficulties. The possibility of issuing decisions as a result of preventive examinations is a potential risk of liability for doctors who do not have specialist knowledge in the field of occupational medicine. CONCLUSIONS The solutions of the Act on COVID-19 regarding the performance of preventive examinations introduce new rights and obligations for employees and employers as well as doctors. Their implementation is necessary due to the purpose of the newly introduced regulations, whose task is to minimize the risk of the COVID-19 infection.

At the single-cell level, studies on the developmental processes of cerebral vascular growth are still relatively few. Techniques for constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on single-cell transcriptome expression data have made significant progress in recent years. Herein, we constructed a single-cell transcriptional regulatory network of mouse cerebrovascular cells. METHODS: The single-cell RNA-seq dataset of mouse brain vessels was downloaded from GEO (GSE98816). This cell clustering was annotated separately using singleR and CellMarker. We then used a modified version of the SCENIC method to construct GRNs. Next, we used a mouse version of SEEK to assess whether genes in the regulon were coexpressed. Finally, regulatory module analysis was performed to complete the cell type relationship quantification. RESULTS: Single-cell RNA-seq data were used to analyze the heterogeneity of mouse cerebrovascular cells, whereby four cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were defined. These subpopulations of cells and marker genes together characterize the molecular profile of mouse cerebrovascular cells. Through these signatures, key transcriptional regulators that maintain cell identity were identified. Our findings identified genes like Lmo2, which play an important role in endothelial cells. The same cell type, for instance, fibroblasts, was found to have different regulatory networks, which may influence the functional characteristics of local tissues.

Methods: We evaluated a throat spray containing three Lactobacillaceae strains with broad antiviral properties in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-eight eligible COVID-19 patients were randomized to verum (n=41) and placebo (n=37) within 96 hours of positive PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and per-protocol analysis was performed. Symptoms and severity were reported daily via an online diary. Combined nose-throat swabs and dried blood spots were collected at regular time points in the study. Results: The daily reported symptoms were highly variable, with no added benefit for symptom resolution in the verum group. Specific monitoring of the applied lactobacilli strains showed that they were detectable via microbiome (27%) and qPCR analysis (82%) of the verum group. Their relative abundances were also negatively correlated with the acute symptom score. At the end of the trial, a trend towards lower SARS-CoV-2 viral loads was observed for the verum group (2/30, 6.7% positive) compared to the placebo group (7/27, 26% positive) (p = 0.07). Conclusions: Despite a trend towards lower SARS-CoV-2 viral loads at the end of the trial and a negative correlation between relative abundances of the applied lactobacilli in the microbiome and acute symptoms, we did not observe a significant effect on overall symptom score for the verum group.

The results showed that the TCoV NC1743 isolate was pathogenic to turkey poults with a minimal infectious dose at 106 EID50/bird. About 50 % of one-day-old SPF turkeys infected with the virus's minimal infectious dose exhibited typical enteric disease signs and lesions from 6 days post-infection (dpi) to the end of the experiment (21 dpi). In contrast, fewer than 20 % of older turkeys (1- or 2-week-old) infected with the same amount of TCoV displayed enteric disease signs, which disappeared after 15-18 dpi. Although all infected turkeys, regardless of age, shed TCoV, the older turkeys shed less virus than the younger birds, and 50 % of the 2-week-old birds even cleared the virus at 21 dpi. Furthermore, the viral infection caused day-old turkeys more body-weight-gain reduction than older birds. The overall data demonstrated that the TCoV NC1743 isolate is a highly pathogenic strain and younger turkeys are more susceptible to TCoV infection than older birds.

Against this backdrop, this article examines digital applications in cultural heritage and, in particular, built heritage via various investigative frameworks to identify topics of relevance and trendlines, mainly for European Union (EU)-based research and policies. Furthermore, this article exemplifies and assesses the specific opportunities and limitations of the different methodical approaches against the backdrop of data-driven vs. data-guided analytical frameworks. As its major findings, our study shows that both research and policies related to digital applications for cultural heritage are mainly driven by the availability of new technologies. Since policies focus on meta-topics such as digitisation, openness or automation, the research descriptors are more granular. In general, data-driven approaches are promising for identifying topics and trendlines and even predicting the development of near future trends. Conversely, qualitative approaches are able to answer why questions with regard to whether topics are emerging due to disruptive innovations or due to new terminologies or whether topics are becoming obsolete because they are common knowledge, as is the case for the term internet.","output":"Digital topics on cultural heritage investigated: how can data-driven and data-guided methods support to identify current topics and trends in digital heritage?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, transportation systems must adapt quickly to satisfy the needs of this new reality.

An unforeseen event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is often referred to as a Black Swan event C being of low probability to occur but causing substantial disruptions to a supply chain. Lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus resulted in significant external and internal disruptions to retailers supply chains. Omnichannel retailers ability to respond to the pandemics disruption hinges on resilient supply chain strategies. Objectives: This article explored the major supply chain disruptions experienced by South African omnichannel retailers because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it investigated the response strategies employed by the retailers as part of their efforts to mitigate the disruptions caused. Method: This study followed a qualitative, exploratory research design. Data were collected through 17 semi-structured interviews with the senior managers from nine different large omnichannel retailers in South Africa. Results: The study found that omnichannel retailers experienced external and internal supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. The most noticeable external disruption was the drastic migration of consumers to online channels and the retailers inability to meet demand surges. Internally, systems constraints of both front-and back-end operations were identified as prominent disruptions. In response, the omnichannel retailers highlighted the importance of being agile to unlocking investments and scale capacity, to plan for the long-term, and to make strategic decisions, fluently. Conclusion: This article adds to the body of knowledge by being one of the first empirical studies to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on omnichannel supply chains in South Africa.

It increased the chlorophyll and soluble sugar levels, which could activate phenylpropane and branched-chain fatty acid pathways, as well as AT3-related enzymes and gene expressions. These led to an enhancement for the synthesis of capsaicinoids, flavonoids, and total phenols. The nano-Se treatment also significantly promoted the expression of phyto-hormones synthesis genes, and consequently increased jasmonic, abscisic, and salicylic acid levels. Proline pathway-related compounds were increased, which could decrease the malondialdehyde and hydroxyl radical levels in crops. This study shows that nano-Se activated capsaicinoid pathways by enhancing photosynthesis and raising soluble sugar levels.

A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of Covid-19, in May 2020 with 2,006 university students from the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. Participants were recruited online and were asked to complete a series of standardised measures of psychological distress, anxiety, flourishing and wellbeing. Attitudes towards Covid-19 were measured using a new scale. The factor structure and reliability of this new scale was confirmed using this European sample. Results indicated that all university students were suffering from poor mental health, considerably below pre-pandemic norms. There were many geographical differences in the way that university students perceived the Covid19 pandemic, in terms of their fears, anxieties, loneliness and positivity. There were also significant mental health comparisons between students from the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain.

METHODS: This study used an automated hand hygiene recording system to measure HCW hand hygiene on entry to and exit from patient rooms throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation between hand hygiene compliance and COVID-19 epidemiological data was analysed. Analysis of variance was performed to compare compliance rate during the different periods of the epidemic. FINDINGS: HCW hand hygiene rate on room entry decreased over time; on room exit, it increased by 13.73% during the first wave of COVID-19, decreased by 9.87% during the post-lockdown period, then rebounded by 2.82% during the second wave of the epidemic. Hand hygiene during patient care and hand hygiene on room exit had a positive relationship with the local COVID-19 epidemic; conversely, hand hygiene on room entry did not depend on the trend of the epidemic, nor on nursing of COVID-19 patients, and it decreased over time.

FcRn plays a role in the function of IVIg because the supraphysiological IgG levels derived from IVIg administrations saturate the FcRn allowing the endogenous IgG to be degraded, instead of being recycled, resulting in high levels of infused IgG ensuring IVIg efficiency. New data in myasthenia gravis patients suggest that the that the Variable Number of Tandem 3/2 (VNTR3/2) polymorphisms in FCGRT, the gene that encodes FcRn, may affect the duration of infused IgG in the circulation and IVIg effectiveness. This review addresses these implications in the context of whether the FCGRT genotype, by affecting the half-life of IVIg, may also play a role in up to 30% of patients with autoimmune neurological diseases, such as GuillainCBarr syndrome, CIDP or Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, who did not respond to IVIg in controlled trials.

Starting from March 2020, tens of conferences have been held virtually. Past conferences have revealed numerous challenges, from budget planning, to selecting the supporting virtual platforms. Among these, two special challenges were identified: 1) how to deliver talks to geo-distributed attendees and 2) how to stimulate social interactions among attendees. These are the two important goals of an academic conference. In this paper, we advocate a mirror program approach for academic conferences.

Gratitude is a prevailing cultural value in many cadaveric anatomy courses, as evidenced by referring to cadaveric specimens as \\"donors\\" and the gratitude ceremonies conducted at the end of many courses. Gratitude is also prevalent within medical school as a whole. For example, due to the difficulty of the application process, many students feel extremely grateful to be able to attend medical school at all. Prosection-based curricula have been proposed as a time-efficient alternative to traditional dissection-based courses. However, little is known about the differences in emotional impact that may arise from this change in course design. We compared the emotional impacts of a dissection-based course vs. a course in which cadavers were prosected (pre-dissected). Our objective was to investigate potential differences between the emotions elicited, such as gratitude, based on pedagogical method. METHODS Students who took a dissection-based anatomy course in 2019 and those who took a prosection-based course in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic were given a validated survey instrument to compare their emotional experiences. The survey included the free-response question, \\"Please describe your feelings in regards to the time spent with the donor or donors using three adjectives, and explain your adjective choices.\\" The responses were analyzed using a grounded theory thematic analysis approach; readers were blind to which cohort wrote which data set. The researchers identified primary codes based on word frequency and pertinence to students' emotional experiences, and then each instance of each code was examined within the context of the response to generate secondary codes until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS The codes appreciate, grateful, and humbled appeared in both data sets. Appreciatehad the widest use case, as appreciatewas also used to acknowledge the complexity or beauty of human anatomy. Humbled had the narrowest use case: this code was primarily directed to the donors or their choice to donate, and also conveyed a greater emotional intensity than the other two codes. Grateful was used most commonly towards the donors and towards the learning experience. A majority of the students in the dissection-based course who used grateful expressed gratitude toward the donor for improving their learning experience; this connection between the donors and enhanced learning was not observed as frequently in the prosection group. The prosection group was also grateful for a wider variety of things. DISCUSSION Both groups in this study expressed gratitude as a major component of their emotional experience in the anatomy laboratory. The results suggest that, for the students in the dissection group, there was a stronger connection between the donors' presence or choice to donate and their learning. The prosection group expressed gratitude to the donors and to the learning experience, but more often expressed these feelings as separate ideas. These findings elucidate the types of gratitude experienced by anatomy students in different anatomy laboratory experiences.","output":"Feelings of Gratitude in Dissection- and Prosection-Based Cadaveric Anatomy Courses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing applications have been introduced in many countries to aid in the containment of COVID-19 outbreaks. Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). Yet, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, and the total effect of digital contact tracing remains elusive. Based on the results of empirical studies and modeling efforts, we show that digital contact tracing apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages up until now, at best. We show that this poor impact can be attributed to a combination of low participation rates, a non-flexible reliance on symptom-based testing, low engagement of participants, and delays between testing and test result upload. We find that contact tracing does not change the epidemic threshold and exclusively prevents more cases during the supercritical phase of an epidemic, making it unfit as a tool to prevent outbreaks. Locally clustered contact structures may increase the intervention's efficacy, but only if the number of contacts per individual is homogeneously distributed, a condition usually not found in contact networks. Our results suggest that policy makers cannot rely on digital contact tracing to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar diseases.","output":"Digital contact tracing contributes little to COVID-19 outbreak containment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Previous research has focused on accuracy associated with real and fake news presented in the form of news headlines only, which does not capture the rich context news is frequently encountered in real life. Additionally, while previous studies on evaluation of real and fake news have mostly focused on characteristics of the evaluator (i.e., analytical reasoning), characteristics of the news stimuli (i.e., news source credibility) and the interplay between the two have been largely ignored. To address these research gaps, this project examined the role of analytical reasoning and news source credibility on evaluation of real and fake full-length news story articles. The project considered both accuracy and perceived credibility ratings as outcome variables, thus qualifying previous work focused solely on news detection accuracy. METHOD We conducted two independent but parallel studies, with Study 2 as a direct replication of Study 1, employing the same design but in a larger sample (Study 1: N = 292 vs. Study 2: N = 357). In both studies, participants viewed 12 full-length news articles (6 real, 6 fake), followed by prompts to evaluate each article's veracity and credibility. Participants were randomly assigned to view articles with a credible or non-credible source and completed the Cognitive Reflection Test as well as short demographic questions. FINDINGS Consistent across both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with greater fake news accuracy, while analytical reasoning was not associated with real news accuracy. In addition, in both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with lower perceived credibility for fake news, while analytical reasoning was not associated with perceived credibility for real news. Furthermore, lower analytical reasoning was associated with greater accuracy for real (but not fake) news from credible compared to non-credible sources, with this effect only detected in Study 2. CONCLUSIONS The novel results generated in this research are discussed in light of classical vs. naturalistic accounts of decision-making as well as cognitive processes underlying news articles evaluation. The results extend previous findings that analytical reasoning contributes to fake news detection to full-length news articles. Furthermore, news-related cues such as the credibility of the news source systematically affected discrimination ability between real and fake news.","output":"The role of analytical reasoning and source credibility on the evaluation of real and fake full-length news articles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents a new mathematical model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus propagation, designed to include all the possible actions to prevent the spread and to help in the healing of infected people.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The annual number of surgical procedures for the management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) by procedure type and age group for the years 2008/09-2017/18 was obtained from the Australian Government Department of Human Services (DHS) database using Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers. The data extracted was limited to females, 25 years and older. These data were used to calculate age-specific and age-standardised rates, so as to accurately analyze trends in the usage of different procedures. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for mid-urethral sling (MUS) insertions were obtained for England's National Health Service (NHS) from the Health and Social Care Information Centre for the years 2008/09-2016/17. These data were also used to calculate annual age-standardised rates for comparative purposes. RESULTS Rates declined for most SUI procedures over time (Mid urethral slings (MUS), colposuspension, fascial slings) except for urethral bulking agents. The absolute number of MUS implanted in 2008/9 was 5729, which decreased to 3127 in the 2017/18 financial year. Over the decade the annual rate for MUS implantation per 100,000 population halved from 78 to 36. Over this same period, the rate of usage of bulking agents doubled, although represented a low volume of procedures (overall numbers increased from 304 to 698 representing an increase from 4 to 8 procedures per 100,000 population). The age-specific peak rate for MUS and Burch colposuspension changed over the decade from 55-64 years to 65-74 years suggesting that women are deferring surgical treatment until later in life. Over the last decade the total number of surgical procedures performed in Australia to treat SUI has decreased markedly from 6812 to 4279. This represents a decrease in the annual rate per 100,000 population from 93 to 49. CONCLUSIONS There are clear changes evident for SUI management in the past decade in Australia, including an overall decline in operative numbers, which correlate with international advisory notifications and local investigations. The results of the Australian Senate inquiry, including removal of single-incision mini-slings, greater availability of patient resources, and greater regulation of SUI procedures will likely have ongoing effects. Surgeons need to ensure sufficient training and patient education continue in order to maintain appropriate access for treatment of SUI in the future.","output":"Stress urinary incontinence in the mesh complication era: current Australian trends."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Off-grid electrification of remote communities using sustainable energy systems (SESs) is a requisite for realizing sustainable development goals Nonetheless, the capacity planning of the SESs is challenging as it needs to fulfil the fluctuating demand from a long-term perspective, in addition to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) Owing to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the capacity planning problem, an efficient technique must be employed to achieve a cost-effective system Existing techniques are, subject to some constraints on the derivability and continuity of the objective function, prone to premature convergence, computationally demanding, follows rigorous procedures to fine-tune the algorithm parameters in different applications, and often do not offer a fair balance during the exploitation and exploration phase of the optimization process Furthermore, the literature review indicates that researchers often do not implement and examine the energy management scheme (EMS) of a microgrid while computing for the capacity planning problem of microgrids This paper proposes a rule-based EMS (REMS) optimized by a nature-inspired grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for long-term capacity planning of a grid-independent microgrid incorporating a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, a battery (BT) bank and a diesel generator (Dgen) In which, a rule-based algorithm is used to implement an EMS to prioritize the usage of RES and coordinate the power flow of the proposed microgrid components Subsequently, an attempt is made to explore and confirm the efficiency of the proposed REMS incorporated with GOA The ultimate goal of the objective function is to minimize the cost of energy (COE) and the deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP) The performance of the REMS is examined via a long-term simulation study to ascertain the REMS resiliency and to ensure the operating limit of the BT storage is not violated The result of the GOA is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) The simulation results indicate that the proposed techniques superiority is confirmed in terms of convergence to the optimal solution The simulation results confirm that the proposed REMS has contributed to better adoption of a cleaner energy production system, as the scheme significantly reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emission and COE by 92 4%, 92 3% and 79 8%, respectively as compared to the conventional Dgen The comparative evaluation of the algorithms shows that REMS-GOA yields a better result as it offers the least COE (objective function), at $0 3656/kW h, as compared to the REMS-CSA at $0 3662/kW h and REMS-PSO at $0 3674/kW h, for the desired DPSP of 0% Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to highlight the effect of uncertainties on the system inputs that may arise in the future","output":"A rule-based energy management scheme for long-term optimal capacity planning of grid-independent microgrid optimized by multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi H58, an antimicrobial-resistant lineage, is globally disseminated but has not been reported in Latin America.

These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials. METHODS: Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1131 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs. Afterward, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pulmonary ADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO. RESULTS: Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associated with 64% and 56% of pulmonary ADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pulmonary ADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We consider pulmonary ADE profiles in multiple long-standing groups of therapeutics including antihypertensive agents, antithrombotic agents, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, in patients with hypertension associated with high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that several individual drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes. For instance, macitentan and bosentan from endothelin receptor antagonists show major concern while doxazosin and rilmenidine exhibited the least pulmonary ADEs compared to the outcomes of other drugs. Using techniques in this study, we assessed and confirmed the hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness.

In the present study, we characterized polyclonal and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) anti--enolase antibodies from immunized chickens. The E. coli-derived recombinant -enolase protein was purified to its high homogenicity as verified by SDS-PAGE. After the 4th immunization, a high titer of specific polyclonal anti--enolase antibodies was elicited in immunized chickens and specifically recognized the purified human -enolase antigen as determined by Western blot and ELISA. The expressed heavy and light chain variable genes (VH and VL) were isolated from spleen B cells and amplified to construct phage antibody libraries containing scFv molecules. After four rounds of panning selection, the scFv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were expressed and their binding specificity to -enolase protein was verified using competitive ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Nucleotide sequence analysis from 10 -enolase binding clones showed that 3 (30%) clones used identical heavy and light genes for scFv antibody expression, as represented by EnL5. Notably, amino acid changes in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were more frequently observed than those in framework regions (FRs) in all clones, indicating a strong affinity selection through mutations.

Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a tool for surveillance and mitigation of potential viral outbreaks, circumventing biases introduced by clinical patient testing. Due to the situation urgency, protocols followed for isolating viral RNA from sewage were not adapted for such sample matrices. In parallel to their implementation for fast collection of data to sustain surveillance and mitigation decisions, molecular protocols need to be harmonized to deliver accurate, reproducible, and comparable analytical outputs. Here we studied analytical variabilities linked to viral RNA isolation methods from sewage. Three different influent wastewater volumes were used to assess the effect of filtered volumes (50, 100 or 500 mL) for capturing viral particles. Three different concentration strategies were tested by electronegative membranes, polyethersulfone membranes, and anion-exchange diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. To compare the number of viral particles, different RNA isolation methods (column-based vs. magnetic beads) were compared. The effect of extra RNA purification steps and different RT-qPCR strategies (one step vs. two-step) were also evaluated. Results showed that the combination of 500 mL filtration volume through electronegative membranes and without multiple RNA purification steps (using column-based RNA purification) using two-step RT-qPCR avoided false negatives when basal viral load in sewage are present and yielded more consistent results during the surveillance done during the second-wave in Delft (The Hague area, The Netherlands). By paving the way for standardization of methods for the sampling, concentration and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from sewage, these findings can help water and health surveillance authorities to use and trust results coming from wastewater based epidemiology studies in order to anticipate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features. OBJECTIVE: To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS: The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (n = 10) or outpatient sector (n = 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart. LIMITATION: Limited sample size. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of thromboembolic events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.

Households had to adapt their day-to-day lifestyles to new circumstances, affecting routines and time dedication to tasks. This national study was carried out to find out how the confinement by COVID-19 affected Spanish households on the perceived habit changes during this period, in relation to their socio-demographic characteristics and household composition. An online questionnaire was launched during the COVID-19 lockdown, from 30 April to 22 June 2020. Descriptive statistics were analyzed, stratified by gender, on time dedication, routine, home leaving, and habit change variables. Chi-square tests were used to explore the relations of significance with socio-demographic characteristics and home composition. All contrast analyses were performed for a 95% confidence level (significance considered for p < 0.05). In total, 1673 respondents participated from different age groups, educational level, employment status and household composition. Sixty percent of respondents maintained their routines. A third tried to establish a new one, being related to women, young people, not a university student, and living with others, including minors. Regarding dedication to tasks, adults aged 35C54 years, with more cohabitants, especially women, devoted themselves intensively to the home or to care, while those under 35 were dedicated more to rest, leisure, television or reading. People with university studies were more related to teleworking. The frequency of going outside was related to gender, age, educational level and living with elders, specifically for grocery shopping and taking out garbage. Changes in habits, routines and time dedication in confinement were strongly linked to the sociodemographic and coexistence conditions in Spanish homes. The greatest impacts were suffered by women, people with children, and adults between 35C54 years of age, especially on care and domestic chores.","output":"Routines, Time Dedication and Habit Changes in Spanish Homes during the COVID-19 Lockdown.

However, the impact of HFNC vs. NIV on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is uncertain. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of HFNC vs. NIV in COVID-19-related AHRF.Methods: Several electronic databases were searched through February 10, 2022, for eligible studies comparing between HFNC and NIV in COVID-19-related AHRF. Our primary outcome was intubation. The secondary outcomes were mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and PaO2/FiO2 ratio changes. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using a random-effect model. Prediction intervals (PI) were calculated to indicate the variance in outcomes that would be expected if new studies were conducted in the future.Results: Nineteen studies involving 3606 subjects (1880 received HFNC and 1726 received NIV) were included. There were no differences in intubation (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.20, P=0.89) or LOS (MD 0.38 days, 95% CI -0.61, 1.37, P=0.45) between groups with consistent results on the subgroup of RCTs. Mortality was lower in NIV (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.98, P=0.03). However, PI was 0.41-1.59, and subgroup analysis of RCTs showed no difference in mortality between groups. There was a greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio with NIV (MD 22.80, 95% CI 5.30-40.31, P=0.01).Conclusions: Our study showed that despite the greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio with NIV, the intubation and length of hospital stay were similar between HFNC and NIV. Although mortality was lower with HFNC than NIV, the prediction interval included the null value, and there was no difference in mortality between HFNC and NIV on a subgroup of RCTs. Future large-scale RCTs are necessary to prove our findings.","output":"High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen versus Non-Invasive Ventilation in Subjects with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Comparative Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 pandemic for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection has required strict measures for virus spreading reduction, including stay-at-home orders.

Delayed diagnosis, poor prognosis, and disease heterogeneity make its treatment ineffective. miRNAs are imposingly involved in personalized medicine such as therapeutics, due to their high sensitivity and accuracy. Our study aimed to reveal the biomarkers that may be involved in the dysregulated immune response in sepsis and lung injury using a computational approach and in vivo validation studies. A sepsis miRNA Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset based on the former analysis of blood samples was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and associated hub genes. Sepsis-associated genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) that overlapped with identified DEM targets were utilized for network construction. In total, 317 genes were found to be regulated by 10 DEMs (three upregulated, namely miR-4634, miR-4638-5p, and miR-4769-5p, and seven downregulated, namely miR-4299, miR-451a, miR181a-2-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-5704, miR-144-3p, and miR-1290). Overall hub genes (HIP1, GJC1, MDM4, IL6R, and ERC1) and for miR-16-5p (SYNRG, TNRC6B, and LAMTOR3) were identified based on centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness). In vivo validation of miRNAs in lung tissue showed significantly downregulated expression of miR-16-5p corroborating with our computational findings, whereas expression of miR-181a-2-3p and miR-451a were found to be upregulated in contrast to the computational approach. In conclusion, the differential expression pattern of miRNAs and hub genes reported in this study may help to unravel many unexplored regulatory pathways, leading to the identification of critical molecular targets for increased prognosis, diagnosis, and drug efficacy in sepsis and associated organ injuries.","output":"Identification and Validation of Potential miRNAs, as Biomarkers for Sepsis and Associated Lung Injury: A Network-Based Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter highlights the various crises facing Europe, and in many regards the world, at this time.

Immunohistochemistry was used, with monoclonal antibodies, to detect the thyroglobulin (TG), calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the thyroid glands. RESULTS Deformation, enlargement, and dystrophy of follicular cells in thyroid glands were found in the SARS patients. The normal follicular epithelial cells were strongly TG positive, however, the number and intensity of TG positive follicular epithelial cells were significantly lower in the SARS patients. Calcitonin positive cells were found in the normal thyroid glands and not in the thyroid glands of the SARS patients. PTH positive cells were seen in the normal thyroid glands and those of the SARS patients with a slightly weaker intensity of reaction, however, with significant difference in IOD (P < 0.01) and without significant difference in mean slight absorption MOD (P > 0.05).

Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD? F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively.

These hardships may heighten stress and amplify persistent and growing health inequities, which were further worsened by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore essential to identify factors that contribute to individual differences in vulnerability so that more effective interventions can be implemented, especially in older adult populations who may face unique economic hardships tied to age discrimination. According to the reserve capacity model, higher levels of psychosocial resources, including psychological well-being, can protect against the negative health outcomes related to heightened stress exposure. This study tested the intersections between recession hardship, pre-existing vulnerability defined as racial and educational disadvantage, and psychological well-being as predictors of biological indicators of chronic allostatic load. Chronic allostatic load was assessed with cardiovascular reactivity and recovery to acute mental stress and systemic inflammation (basal indicators of C-reactive protein and interleukin 6). Biological data came from a national sample of adults known as the Midlife in the US Study (MIDUS; age = 25-75, N=863) that completed assessments after the recession. Multiple regression models revealed that more widespread recession hardship predicted greater biological dysregulation. Tests of three-way interactions revealed that the association between recession hardship and biological dysregulation was strongest among respondents with combined disadvantages of low educational status and low levels of psychological well-being. This study connected a major economic event to individual variation in health vulnerability and identified potential biological pathways to future disease outcomes.","output":"The 2008 Recession and Biological Health: Psychological Well-Being and Social Disadvantage Modify Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of the passage of time on parent-offspring behaviour of urban Herring Gulls (Larus Argentatus) was studied and analysed using a three-term contingency model.

An analysis of aligned tRNA sequences present in the GtRNAdb database (the Lowe Laboratory, University of California, Santa Cruz) led to surprising conservations on some cytosolic tRNAs specific for alanine compared to other tRNA species, including tRNAs specific for glycine. First, besides the well-known G3oU70 base pair in the amino acid stem, there is the frequent occurrence of a second wobble pair at G30oU40, a pair generally observed as a WatsonCCrick pair throughout phylogeny. Second, the tertiary pair R15/Y48 occurs as a purineCpurine R15/A48 pair. Finally, the conserved T54/A58 pair maintaining the fold of the T-loop is observed as a purineCpurine A54/A58 pair. The R15/A48 and A54/A58 pairs always occur together. The G30oU40 pair occurs alone or together with these other two pairs. The pairing variations are observed to a variable extent depending on phylogeny. Among eukaryotes, insects display all variations simultaneously, whereas mammals present either the G30oU40 pair or both R15/A48 and A54/A58. tRNAs with the anticodon 34A(I)GC36 are the most prone to display all those pair variations in mammals and insects. tRNAs with anticodon Y34GC36 have preferentially G30oU40 only. These unusual pairs are not observed in bacterial, nor archaeal, tRNAs, probably because of the avoidance of A34-containing anticodons in four-codon boxes. Among eukaryotes, these unusual pairing features were not observed in fungi and nematodes.

This positive bias within high-risk groups has also varied over time, depending on testing capability and indications for being tested. In contrast, throughout the pandemic, routine COVID-19 screening tests for elective procedures and operations unrelated to COVID-19 risk have been administered by medical facilities to reduce transmission to medical staffing and other patients. We propose the use of these pre-procedural COVID-19 patient datasets to reduce biases in community trends and better understand local prevalence. MethodsUsing patient data from the Maui Medical Group clinic, we analyzed 12,640 COVID-19 test results from May 1, 2020 to March 16, 2021, divided into two time periods corresponding with Mauis outbreak. ResultsMean positivity rates were 0.1% for the pre-procedural group, 3.9% for the symptomatic group, 4.2% for the exposed group, and 2.0% for the total study population. Post-outbreak, the mean positivity rate of the pre-procedural group was significantly lower than the aggregate group (all other clinic groups combined). The positivity rates of both pre-procedural and aggregate groups increased over the study period, although the pre-procedural group showed a smaller rise in rate. ConclusionsPre-procedural groups may produce different trends compared to high-risk groups and are sufficiently robust to detect small changes in positivity rates. Considered in conjunction with high-risk groups, pre-procedural marker groups used to monitor understudied, low-risk subsets of a community may improve our understanding of community COVID-19 prevalence and trends.","output":"Pre-procedural testing improves estimated COVID-19 prevalence and trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for rapid high-throughput methods for sensitive and specific serological detection of infection with novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Multiplex serological testing can be particularly useful because it can simultaneously analyze antibodies to multiple antigens that optimizes pathogen coverage, and controls for variability in the organism and the individual host response. Here we describe a SARS-CoV-2 IgG 3-plex fluorescent microsphere-based assay that can detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-the spike (S) protein, spike angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (Nc). The assay was shown to have comparable performance to a SARS-CoV-2 reference assay for IgG in serum obtained at 21 days from symptom onset but had higher sensitivity with samples collected at 5 days from symptom onset. Further, using soluble ACE2 in a neutralization assay format, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD.","output":"A Rapid, Multiplex Dual Reporter IgG and IgM SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Assay for a Multiplexed Bead-Based Flow Analysis System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Persons aged more than 65 years may be more prone to suffer from chronic diseases and comorbidities (as demonstrated by the recent COVID-19 pandemics) and are treated with multiple concomitant medications. This may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that are often overlooked in clinical practice. Elderly patients are more affected by comorbidities increasing the risk of DDIs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Statins are effective in elderly patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are prescribed on a long-term basis and may undergo DDIs, particularly on pharmacokinetic bases. The risk of DDIs varies among statins, and safety and ADRs of statins are of special concern in patients affected by multiple chronic conditions requiring concomitant therapies at risk of DDIs, such as the elderly. AREAS COVERED The purpose of this manuscript is to give an update on the potential statin DDIs and related ADRs with an exclusive focus on the data available in elderly patients. EXPERT OPINION A better and more close attention to the potential DDIs among statins and other therapeutic options will help physicians in selecting the more effective and less harmful treatment for their patients. This is of importance, especially in older patients.","output":"Potential statin drug interactions in elderly patients: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 on public health and the global economy has led to an unprecedented research response, with a major emphasis on the development of safe vaccines and drugs. However, effective, safe treatments typically take over a decade to develop and there are still no clinically approved therapies to treat highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Repurposing of known drugs can speed up development and this strategy, along with the use of biologicals (notably monoclonal antibody therapy) and vaccine development programmes remain the principal routes to dealing with the immediate impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the development of broadly-effective highly potent antivirals should be a major longer term goal. Structural biology has been applied with enormous effect, with key proteins structurally characterised only weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was released. Open-access to advanced infrastructure for structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and high-end cryo-EM and NMR centres has brought these technologies centre-stage in drug discovery.

PEDV infection causes lesions and clinical symptoms, and infected pigs often succumb to severe dehydration. If there is not a timely and effective method to control its infection, PEDV will spread rapidly across the whole swine farm. Therefore, preclinical identification of PEDV is of great significance for preventing the outbreak and spread of this disease. In this study, a functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR method (UNDP-PCR) specific for PEDV was developed through systematic optimization of functionalized magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles which were further used to specifically enrich viral RNA from the lysate of PEDV stool samples, forming a MMPs-RNA-AuNPs complex. Then, oligonucleotides specific for PEDV coated on AuNPs were eluted from the complex and were further amplified and characterized by PCR. The detection limitation of the established UNDP-PCR method for PEDV was 25 copies in per gram PEDV stool samples, which is 400-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR for stool samples. The UNDP-PCR for PEDV exhibited reliable reproducibility and high specificity, no cross-reaction was observed with other porcine viruses. In 153 preclinical fecal samples, the positive detection rate of UNDP-PCR specific for PEDV (30.72%) was much higher than that of conventional RT-PCR (5.88%) and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. In a word, this study provided a RNA extraction and transcription free, rapid and economical method for preclinical PEDV infection, which showed higher sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, and exhibited application potency for evaluating viral loads of preclinical samples.","output":"Ultrasensitive Detection of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus from Fecal Samples Using Functionalized Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV) cause economically important diseases that are currently exotic to the United Kingdom (UK), but have significant potential for introduction and onward transmission.

Risk pathways for each virus were identified and assessed using published literature, animal import data and outputs from epidemiological models. Direct imports of infected animals, as well as wind-borne infected Culicoides, were considered as routes of incursion. The proximity of ongoing disease events in mainland Europe and proven capability of transmission to the UK places ZSL London Zoo at higher risk of BTV release and exposure (estimated as low to medium) than AHSV (estimated as very low to low).

The study aimed at investigating the protective effects of antiviral therapy on the liver and innate immunity in patients with TB-HBV coinfection. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with TB-HBV coinfection were recruited and split into antituberculosis and antiviral groups, 50 per group, according to odd or even date of hospital admission from December 2019 to October 2020. The patients in the anti-TB group received antituberculosis therapy, and those in the antiviral group received antiviral therapy. The clinical effectiveness; HBV-DNA negative conversion rate; liver function assessment involving alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL); immune function evaluation including CD4(+), CD8(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+), and CD3(+) T cells; inflammatory cytokines containing tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon- (IFN-); and intestinal microflora including bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterobacterium, enterococcus, and clostridium were main outcome measures after treatment. RESULTS: It was found that the total response rate in the antiviral group was significantly higher than the anti-TB group after treatment ((2) = 3.157, P=0.017). There was a significant difference in HBV-DNA negative conversion rates between the antiviral group and anti-TB group (82% vs. 58%, (2) = 6.384, P=0.001). The ALT, AST, and TBIL in the two groups were all increased after treatment (P < 0.05), but the antiviral group indicated a rise of the above indices compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). The two groups showed a rise on the concentration of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells and a decline on the CD8(+) T cells after treatment (P < 0.05), but these changes in the antiviral group were more evident to those in the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). There was an increase on the IFN- level and decrease on the TNF- and IL-6 levels in both groups after treatment (P < 0.05), but the antiviral group revealed a higher level of IFN- with lower levels of TNF- and IL-6 compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was increased, and the number of enterobacteria, enterococci, and clostridium were decreased in the two groups (P < 0.05), while these changes in the antiviral group were more remarkable compared to the anti-TB group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (2 = 0.267, P=0.731).

Objective: To investigate health-related students' usage and opinions about the StopCovid app. Methods: A field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics were performed. Results: A total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210).

However, with the gradual easing of lockdown policies in most countries, the majority of non-essential retail businesses are trying their best to bounce back both economically and socially. Nevertheless, the efforts of retail traders are hampered by uncertainty regarding what capacity measures need to be taken, and there is an urgent need to understand how social distancing can be safely followed and implemented in these spaces. This paper draws from retail space allocation, crowd science, operational research and ergonomics/biomechanics to develop a method for identifying the minimum amount of space an individual needs to socially distance in shops, markets, shopping centres and open commercial spaces, when there are other people present. The area required per person is calculated for both static space (where people are seated, standing or queuing, for example) and dynamic space (where people need to walk freely). We propose our method as a step forward in understanding the very practical problem of capacity, which can hopefully allow retail spaces to operate safely, and minimise the risk of virus transmission.","output":"How safe is it to shop?

Drug shortages before and during the COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges, particularly during surges. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a structured, daily huddle report on analgosedative medication use in mechanically ventilated MICU patients. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included 3 two-month epochs before (E1), during (E2) and after (E3) initiation of an interprofessional pre-round huddle. Two metrics presented included continuous infusion (CI) analgosedation and drug shortages in effort to identify opportunities for scheduled enteral or parenteral therapies to aid CI weaning. Adult patients admitted to the MICU and on CI analgosedation were included. The primary endpoint compared daily and cumulative scheduled parenteral, enteral, and CI analgosedation administered between epochs. Secondary endpoints included percent-time in goal RASS, Objective Pain Assessment Scale (OPAS), time without delirium, evaluation of drug costs, and effect on ICU outcomes between epochs. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients (E1: 27;E2: 23;E3: 31) were included. Mean age (E1, 65.915.4 vs E2, 59.710.3 vs E3, 56.312.6 years;p=0.021) and proportion COVIDpositive (E1, 0 [0%] vs E2, 6 [26.1%] vs E3, 3 [9.7%];p=0.013) were different between groups. Cumulative CI opioid requirements (E1, 719.5 (214.4-1874.5) vs E2, 641.9 (503.7-1675.9) vs E3, 430.4 (247.2-856.5) mg morphine equivalents;p=0.029) were significantly different. Time on CI fentanyl (E1, 85.9 (46.1-170.5) vs E2, 95.3 (47.2-161.7) vs E3, 41.4 (12.4-67.2) hours;p=0.003) was also decreased. Percent-time in goal OPAS, RASS, without delirium were similar between epochs.

CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis of a structured approach in scheduling enteral and parenteral agents to wean off CI analgosedation during drug shortages may be effective.

None of the previous studies of naturally occurring colds has conducted appropriate virological assays to determine the nature of the infecting agent. This is an essential methodological step in studies of malaise associated with URTIs. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring colds on mood and objective measures of performance. This was done by first conducting a cross-sectional comparison of 37 healthy people and 158 volunteers with colds and then a longitudinal study in which 100 volunteers developed colds and 87 remained healthy. Virological techniques were used to identify infecting agents and comparisons made across the different groups. The results showed that having a cold was associated with reduced alertness and slowed reaction times. These effects were observed both for colds where the infecting virus was identified and those where it was not. Similar effects were obtained for both rhinovirus and coronavirus colds. One may conclude that upper respiratory tract illnesses lead to a reduction in subjective alertness and impaired psychomotor functioning. This was true for both illnesses where the infecting agent was identified and for those clinical illnesses where no virus was detected. It is now important to identify the mechanisms linking infection and illness with the behavioural changes. Similarly, the impact of these effects on real-life activities such as driving needs examining. Finally, methods of treatment need to be developed which not only treat the local symptoms of the illnesses but remove the negative mood and the performance impairments. ? 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence.

Satisfactory classifier selection can help in reducing time and costs involved in the technology adoption process. As there are multiple criteria from different domains and several candidate classification algorithms, the classifier selection process is now a problem that can be addressed using Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the classifier selection problem by integrating Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The step-by-step procedure behind this application is as follows. First, IF-DEMATEL was used for estimating the criteria and sub-criteria weights considering uncertainty. This method was also employed to evaluate the interrelations among classifier selection criteria. Finally, a modified TOPSIS was applied to generate an overall suitability index per classifier so that the most effective ones can be selected. The proposed approach was validated using a real-world case study concerning the adoption of a mobile-based reminding solution by People with Dementia (PwD). The outputs allow public health managers to accurately identify whether PwD can adopt an assistive technology which results in (i) reduced cost overruns due to wrong classification, (ii) improved quality of life of adopters, and (iii) rapid deployment of intervention alternatives for non-adopters.","output":"A Novel Integration of IF-DEMATEL and TOPSIS for the Classifier Selection Problem in Assistive Technology Adoption for People with Dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The primary objective of this randomized controlled challenge study was to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in preweaned dairy calves. The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (SD) age of 52  6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 10(10) cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when 1 cm(2) of lung consolidation was observed and 6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions 1 cm(2) were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if 2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93  28, CON: 96  17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.","output":"Effect of antibiotic treatment in preweaned Holstein calves after experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the entire world ever since its emergence in March 2020. The disease manifestation of COVID-19 has been more severe, with a high degree of mortality in the elderly than in the young population. The cycle threshold (Ct ) value obtained in the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the surrogate marker of viral load. Therefore, assessing Ct value and clinical status among different age groups with SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to understand the viral kinetics and to assess the transmission potential of that particular age group. Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the viral load and clinical status among different age groups with COVID-19 infection. Methods and materials A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out to analyze the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples reported from April 2020 till May 2021. The results of 13,820 RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) positive samples were included for analysis of Ct values. Ct values of confirmatory genes were taken into consideration, and Ct values below 25, >25 to 30, and >30 were categorized as high, moderate, and low viral load, respectively. Age group was stratified into 18 years (young), 18-60 years (adult), and >60 years (elderly). The data were analyzed using SPSS Windows Version 25.0. Results The mean Ct values were 27.9, 26, and 26.2 in the young, adult, and elderly age groups, respectively. The mean Ct values of young patients were significantly higher as compared to adult and elderly patients (p<0.05). The percentage of high viral load (Ct<25) was found to be significantly higher in adults and elderly (44.6% & 43.7%) as compared to young (32.2%) (p<0.001). Majority of the COVID-19 positive cases younger than 18 years (75.9%) were asymptomatic as compared to 64.5% and 59.7% in the adult and elderly age groups, respectively. Conclusion This study observed a significantly high proportion of viral load in the adult and elderly population, which plays a substantial contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas the majority of the young population being asymptomatic plays a major role as silent transmitters. The study reemphasizes the need for strict adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviors.","output":"Comparison of Cycle Threshold and Clinical Status Among Different Age Groups of COVID-19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern manufacturing is highly competitive, requiring that organizations reduce lead times and achieve greater organizational flexibility, for example by implementing agile ways of working. However, studies show that incumbent firms have persistent problems with adopting and scaling such practices. In this paper, we present an empirical account of agile transformation in a large manufacturing company that has adopted the SAFe framework. Based on interviews, focus groups, and observation data, we identify three themes for understanding how employees experience and cope with transformative change by: 1) making sense of the new, 2) practicing with peers and 3) letting go of legacy. Key findings are that initially employees are more concerned with making sense of the new rather than with the implementation of agile itself and that implementation of agile happens very gradually over time rather than through major breakthroughs. Thus, it takes time for employees to weather change, become acquainted with the new way of working and stabilize how they work together in the agile teams and across the ARTs (Agile Release Trains).

The objective of this prospective study was to determine the success rate of performing a plantar fasciotomy using a microdebrider coblation wand to treat plantar fasciitis and determine utility of ultrasonographic imaging to evaluate for recovery after treatment. METHODS: Patients with plantar fasciitis treated with a plantar fasciotomy using a microdebrider coblation wand were prospectively followed for 1 year. Outcome measures included numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure for activities of daily living (FAAMA) and for sports (FAAMS), and plantar fascia thickness evaluated with ultrasonographic imaging. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. Average patient age was 53.4  9.9 years. Average symptom duration prior to the procedure was 20  26 months. Five patients dropped out of the study at various points, most due to the COVID quarantine. The mean preoperative NRS score was 4.7 and at 3 and 6 months postprocedure was 2. At 1 year, the outcomes were all improved compared to the preoperative status: NRS 0.71.3 (P < .001), FADI 10716 (P < .001), FAAMA 95%10% (P < .001), FAAMS 84%19% (P < .001), and plantar fascia thickness 6.8  1.2 mm (P = .014).

The player base is extremely diverse - for instance, two top players are a 40 year old female accountant and a male taxi driver. Among statistical predictors for retention and in-game high scores, the data from our first year suggest that people recruited based on real-world physics interest and via real-world events, but only with an intermediate science education, are more likely to become engaged and skilled contributors. Interestingly, female players tended to perform better than male players, even though men played more games per day. To understand this relationship, we explore the profiles of our top players in more depth.

Aim: The aim of the study is to assess cyberchondria and its association with depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life (QOL) in dental students during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on dental students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured pro forma, General Health Questionnaire-12, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21, Cyberchondria Severity Scale 15, and European Health Interview Survey QOL 8. Results: The study revealed that 98.7% of the students were affected by one of the constructs of cyberchondria, viz., \\"excessiveness\\" (93.7%), followed by \\"distress\\" (84.3%) and \\"reassurance\\"-seeking behavior (83.7%).

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03).

The role of hydroxyzine and distractive techniques such as clowns in the management of anxiety is controversial. Our main objective was to evaluate the effect of hydroxyzine on the control of POA. The secondary objective was to assess the potential additive effect of hydroxyzine and distracting techniques. We performed a randomized double-blind, controlled clinical trial in children aged 2C16 years undergoing outpatient surgery (n = 165).

Studies matched the selection criteria were included. Data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies were independently conducted by two reviewers. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 9 trials including 1108 COVID-19 patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that QFPDD combined with WMT reduced aggravation rate (AR) by 71% [risk ratio (RR) = 0.29, 95% confidence intervals (CI) (0.17, 0.51)], increased effective rate (ER) by 13% [RR = 1.13, 95%CI (1.04, 1.22)], shortened 4.78 days of viral shedding [95%CI (-5.79, -3.77)] and 4.45 days of hospital stay [95%CI (-6.05, -2.86)], also decreased the incidence of adverse events (AE) by 56% [RR = 0.44, 95%CI (0.22, 0.89)]. CONCLUSION: QFPDD combined with WMT might reduce the proportion of severe cases and the incidence of AE, shorten the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital stay. More randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to confirm our findings in the future.","output":"Effect of Qingfei Paidu decoction combined with Western medicine treatments for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: School closure is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that was considered in many national pandemic plans developed prior to the start of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, and received considerable attention during the event. Here, we retrospectively review and compare national and local experiences with school closures in several countries during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Our intention is not to make a systematic review of country experiences; rather, it is to present the diversity of school closure experiences and provide examples from national and local perspectives. METHODS: Data were gathered during and following a meeting, organized by the European Centres for Disease Control, on school closures held in October 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden. A standard data collection form was developed and sent to all participants. The twelve participating countries and administrative regions (Bulgaria, China, France, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States) provided data. RESULTS: Our review highlights the very diverse national and local experiences on school closures during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The processes including who was in charge of making recommendations and who was in charge of making the decision to close, the school-based control strategies, the extent of school closures, the public health tradition of responses and expectations on school closure varied greatly between countries. Our review also discusses the many challenges associated with the implementation of this intervention and makes recommendations for further practical work in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The single most important factor to explain differences observed between countries may have been the different public health practises and public expectations concerning school closures and influenza in the selected countries.","output":"School closures during the 2009 influenza pandemic: national and local experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, medical applications for 3D printing are expanding rapidly and are expected to revolutionize health care, specifically, manufacturing surgical guides and protective face mask against coronavirus (COVID-19). These instruments come in contact with the human tissues, being necessary 3D printed materials free of pathogenic microbes or other contaminants. Therefore, they must be sterilized to avoid that bacteria can attach to the surface and produce biofilm. With the aim of avoiding bacterial biofilm formation and minimize the health risks, acrylic acid (AcAc) coatings applied by plasma-polymerization have been deposited on 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) Petri dishes. Six antimicrobial-resistant clinical and two susceptible control strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus species were analyzed. AcAc coatings provide the surface with greater hydrophilicity and, consequently, the formation of a hydration layer, whose thickness is related to the surface roughness. This hydration layer could explain the reduction of bacterial attachment and, consequently, the biofilm formation. Antibiofilm coatings are more successful against P. aeruginosa strains than against S. aureus ones; due to some coatings presents a smaller topography scale than the P. aeruginosa length, reducting the contact area between the bacteria and the coating, and causing a potential rupture of the cellular membrane. AcAc coatings with less number of plasma passes were more effective, and showed up to a 50% relative biofilm reduction (in six of the eight strains studied) compared with the untreated plates.","output":"Antibiofilm coatings through atmospheric pressure plasma for 3D printed surgical instruments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Masks play a role in the protection of health-care workers (HCWs) from acquiring respiratory infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in health-care settings.

Circular RNA HIPK3 (CircHIPK3) is reported to be abnormally expressed in various disease tissues and affects the occurrence and development of the disease. However, the role and underlying mechanism of CircRNA HIPK3 in osteoarthritis are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of CircRNA HIPK3 on osteoarthritis and analyze its regulatory mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We took human OA tissues, normal knee cartilage, human OA chondrocytes and normal chondrocytes as the research objects. Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect CircHIPK3 expression level, its target gene miRNA 124 (miR-124) and downstream target molecule SOX8. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to discover the apoptosis of CircHIPK3 and miR-124 on OA cartilage in different transfection situations. Moreover, Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of caspase-3 in OA chondrocytes. The binding site of CircRNA HIPK3 and miR-124, miR-124, and SOX8 were verified by using Dual-Luciferase assay. RESULTS: High expressed CircHIPK3 and low expressed miR-124 were found in OA tissues and OA chondrocytes. In addition, the Dual-Luciferase report showed CircHIPK3 acted as a sponge of miR-124 in OA chondrocytes. CircHIPK3 and miR-124 expression in OA tissue were confirmed to be negatively correlated. To our surprise, knocking down CircHIPK3 and transfected miR-124 mimics both inhibited the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes. Further experiments verified that the downstream target molecule of miR-124 was SOX8 in OA chondrocytes. Besides, miR-124 inhibitors reversed the knockdown of CircHIPK3 while si-SOX8 reversed the miR-124 inhibitors effect of apoptosis on OA chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that CircHIPK3 was significantly upregulated in OA cartilage tissue and cells. Low expression of CircHIPK3 promoted the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes by promoting miR-124 to suppress SOX8 expression. The molecular mechanism of CircHIPK3 in present study is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of osteoarthritis.","output":"Low expression of CircRNA HIPK3 promotes osteoarthritis chondrocyte apoptosis by serving as a sponge of miR-124 to regulate SOX8"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION One way how to reduce morbidity and improve cosmesic of kidney surgery is single site laparoscopy. Relatively well described concept but without defined position in clincal practise. AIM To report of institutional experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) nephrectomy (NE) and compare (matched case-control study) it with that of standard laparoscopic NE (LNE). MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 8/2011 to 10/2013, we performed 183 mini-invasive NE (132 tumours, 51 benign aetiology); 45 of them (24.6%) were LESS, the rest LNE. The main but not absolute indications for LESS were: non-obese men, and less advanced tumours. In 13 patients undergoing LESS-NEs (28.9%) there was a transumbilical approach. For the rest, a pararectal incision was performed and an accessory port was added in 31.1% (14) - 2/22 (9.1%) left sided, 12/23 (52.2%) right sided. Twenty-four LESS-NE were performed by a more experienced surgeon (mean operation time (MOT) 73.1 min), 21 LESS-NE by 4 other surgeons (MOT 132.8 min). These 24 were compared with 43 LNE done by the same surgeon before the period of LESS (1/2007-8/2011) and with similar characteristics of cases (body mass index (BMI)  35 kg/m(2), less advanced tumour). RESULTS We found no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters studied. The MOT 73.1 min vs. 75.0 min (p = 0.78), BMI 27.4 kg/m(2) vs. 29.2 kg/m(2) (p = 0.08), blood loss 54.7 vs. 39.2 (p = 0.47). Complications (4.2% vs. 11.6%) were only of internal character in origin. No conversion in either group. In LESS-NE, staplers were used more frequently (more expensive than clips) for division of renal hilar vessels (70.8% vs. 51.2%). The mean price of LESS-NE was 367 higher. CONCLUSIONS The LESS NE performed by an experienced surgeon is a safe and efficient method for the surgical treatment of both malignant and benign renal conditions in patients with BMI < 30 kg/m(2) and with low-stage tumours. The LESS NE is more expensive compared to LNE.","output":"Position of laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery nephrectomy in clinical practice and comparison (matched case-control study) with standard laparoscopic nephrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors recount the challenges they overcame to deliver lecture content and assessments while engaging students at their newly established medical school.

RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Males accounted for significantly more patients than did females (OR 1.59; 95%CI 1.25-2.02) (P<.001). The total incidence of VTE among COVID-19 patients was 28.3 % (95%CI 21.6-35.4), with an incidence of 38.0% (95%CI 29.1-47.4) and 17.2% (95%CI 11.4-23.8) among severe COVID-19 cases and general cases, respectively. The total incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of lower extremities was 18.3% (95%CI 10.8-27.2), and the occurrence of DVT was 22.1% (95%CI 11.0-35.5) and 12.8% (95%CI 5.0-23.3) in severe and general cases, respectively.

In this study, we aimed to compare BE approach versus physicochemical method for the evaluation of metabolic acid-base disturbances in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Method: Between March 2020 and May 2020, ABG analysis results of a total of 113 patients (71 males, 42 females) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized in the adult intensive care units were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into groups according to the BE approach and evaluated for physicochemical components. The ABG and some electrolyte values were compared among groups. Results: The most common acidotic components according to the Stewarts method were hyperphosphatemia (84.9%), but low strong ion difference (SID) acidosis (62.2%) in patients with metabolic acidosis according to the BE approach. Low SID acidosis (50%) and hyperphosphatemia (30.9%) in patients with normal BE and hyperphosphatemia (77.7%) in patients with metabolic alkalosis according to the BE approach were observed.

Although extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the regulation of interferon (IFN) responses by alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and gammacoronaviruses, little is known about this process during deltacoronavirus infection. In this study, we found that PDCoV infection fails to induce, and even remarkably inhibits, Sendai virus- or poly(I: C)-induced IFN- production by impeding the activation of transcription factors NF-B and IRF3. We also found that PDCoV infection significantly suppresses the activation of IFN- promoter stimulated by IRF3 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, TBK1, IKK) in the RIG-I signaling pathway, but does not counteract its activation by the constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (IRF3C5D). Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV infection suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling pathway, providing a better understanding of the PDCoV immune evasion strategy.","output":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection suppresses RIG-I-mediated interferon- production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of definitive anti-viral therapy, there is considerable interest in mitigating against severe inflammatory reactions in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to improve survival. These reactions are sometimes termed cytokine storm. PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4i) have anti-inflammatory properties with approved indications in inflammatory skin and joint diseases as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4i in respiratory models of viral and bacterial infection and also after chemically mediated lung injury. The rationale for PDE4i use in COVID-19 patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile. We highlight how PDE4i could be an overlooked treatment from the rheumatologic and respiratory armamentarium, which has potential beneficial immune-modulation for treating severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storms. The proposed use of PDE4i is also supported by age-related immune changes in inflammation severity in PDE4i modifiable pathways in primate coronavirus disease. In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with COVID-19 may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with PDE4i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.","output":"Rationale for Evaluating PDE4 Inhibition for Mitigating against Severe Inflammation in COVID-19 Pneumonia and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This editorial reports on a thorough analysis of the abundance and scarcity distribution of chemical elements and the minerals they form in the Earth, Sun, and Universe in connection with their number of neutrons and binding energy per nucleon.

Two time periods were selected. The study period was defined as the time after first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The control period was defined as one year prior to the first case being reported, taken from 1st March 2019 to 29th February, 2020. The parameters we studied included were number of number of hospital admissions, emergency patients, OPD patients, major surgeries, total surgeries, radiological investigations done, laboratory investigations done, births and mortalities. All parameters were calculated by taking monthly average during each time period and then compared. RESULTS A decrease in almost all parameters was seen when the cases of the two time periods were compared. There was a decrease in the average hospital admission by 51%, while the patients seen in OPD fell by almost 60%. A slight decrease of 25% was seen in the cases presenting to the emergency. The most marked decrease was in the elective surgeries, which was 66% closely followed by average monthly mortality which decreased by 64%. Average monthly minor surgeries and births were decreased by 33% and 35%, respectively.

The aim of our study was to study the clinical profile and outcomes of GBS in COVID-19 from the Western region of India, the State of Maharashtra. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter observation study from different hospitals in Maharashtra beginning from March 2020 until November 2020. RESULTS: We report 42 patients with COVID-19 GBS. Mean age was 59 years (range, 24--85 years). 31/42 (73.8%) were men. GBS was the presenting symptom in 14/42 (33%), while six of them remained asymptomatic for COVID-19 despite positive SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The median interval between COVID-19 and GBS was 14 days (SD + 11), with minimum of 1 and maximum 40 days. Clinical presentation was like that of typical GBS. Electrophysiological studies showed a predominant demyelinating pattern in 25/42 (59.5%). Inflammatory markers were elevated in 35/42 (83.3%) and 38/42 (90.5%) had an Abnormal high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest. 14/42 (33.3%) patients required a ventilator, with nine deaths. Intravenous immunoglobulin was the mainstay of treatment for GBS. Majority had a good outcome and were walking independently or with minimal support at discharge. In subgroup analysis, the postinfectious group had a better outcome than the parainfectious group. CONCLUSION: GBS in COVID-19 occurs as both parainfectious and postinfectious GBS. Parainfectious GBS needs more rigorous monitoring and may benefit from COVID-19 specific treatment.

In patients aged 65 years and older, triage decisions are regularly based on degree of frailty measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). However, the CFS could also be useful in patients younger than 65 years. We aimed to examine the association between CFS score and hospital mortality and between CFS score and admission to intensive care in adult patients of all ages with COVID-19 across Europe. Methods: This analysis was part of the COVID Medication (COMET) study, an international, multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study in 63 hospitals in 11 countries in Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had been admitted to hospital, and either tested positive by PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or were judged to have a high clinical likelihood of having SARS-CoV-2 infection by the local COVID-19 expert team. CFS was used to assess level of frailty: fit (CFS1-3), mildly frail (CFS4-5), or frail (CFS6-9). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was admission to intensive care. Data were analysed using a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for covariates (age, sex, number of drugs prescribed, and type of drug class as a proxy for comorbidities). Findings: Between March 30 and July 15, 2020, 2434 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 55-77]; 1480 [61%] men, 954 [30%] women) had CFS scores available and were included in the analyses. In the total sample and in patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients and mildly frail patients had a significantly higher risk of hospital mortality than fit patients (total sample: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 odds ratio [OR] 271 [95% CI 204-360], p<00001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 154 [116-206], p=00030; age &#8805;65 years: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 290 [212-397], p<00001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 164 [120-225], p=00020). In patients younger than 65 years, an increased hospital mortality risk was only observed in frail patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 222 [108-457], p=0030; CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 108 [048-239], p=086). Frail patients had a higher incidence of admission to intensive care than fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 154 [121-197], p=00010), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 071 [055-092], p=00090). Among patients younger than 65 years, frail patients had an increased incidence of admission to intensive care (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 296 [198-443], p<00001), whereas mildly frail patients had no significant difference in incidence compared with fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 093 [063-138], p=072). Among patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients had no significant difference in the incidence of admission to intensive care compared with fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 127 [092-175], p=014), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 066 [047-093], p=0018). Interpretation: The results of this study suggest that CFS score is a suitable risk marker for hospital mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. However, treatment decisions based on the CFS in patients younger than 65 years should be made with caution.

However, the role of SARS-CoV-2 RBD N-glycosylation in viral entry remains elusive. In this study, we expressed and purified N331 and N343 N-glycosite mutants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that de-glycosylation at N331 and N343 drastically reduces the RBD binding to ACE2. More importantly, based on qualitative and quantitative virology research methods, we show that the mutation of RBD N-glycosites interfered with SARS-CoV-2 internalization rather than attachment potentially by decreasing RBD binding to the receptors. Also, the double N-glycosites mutant (N331 + N343) showed significantly increased sensitivity against the designated RBD neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these results suggest that N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is not only critical for viral internalization into respiratory epithelial cells but also shields the virus from neutralization.

We aim to investigate the association between different dosages of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Methods and Results: Retrospective study of 450 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to SantOrsola Bologna Hospital from March 01 to April 10, 2020. Clinical, laboratory and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The in-hospital mortality between COVID-19 patients treated with standard prophylactic LMWH dosage vs. intermediate LMWH dosage was compared. Out of 450 patients, 361 received standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis enoxaparin treatment (40-60mg daily) and 89 patients received intermediate enoxaparin dosage (40C60 mg twice daily) for 7 days. No significant differences in the main demographic characteristics and laboratory testings at admission were observed in the two heparin regimen subgroups, except for older age and prevalence of hypertension in the group treated with standard prophylaxis LMWH dosage. The intermediate LMWH administration was associated with a lower in-hospital all-cause mortality compared to the standard prophylactic LMWH dosage (18.8% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.02). This difference remained significant after adjustment with the propensity score for variables that differed significantly between the dosage groups (OR= 0.260, 95% CI 0.089C0.758, p=0.014).

Objectives: Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the therapeutic management of JIA, the frequency of returning to school after the first lockdown period and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the survey. Methods: JIA patients under 18 years of age, usually treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were prospectively included during their outpatient visit and completed a standardized questionnaire. Data regarding the general characteristics of the participants, medical history, SARS-CoV-2 infection, characteristics of JIA subtypes and treatment modifications were collected. Results: A total of 173 patients from 8 different expert centers were included between May and August 2020. Their mean age was 11.6 years ( 4.1 years), and most of them 31.2% (54/173) had a rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA. Fifty percent (86/172) were treated with methotrexate, and 72.5% (124/171) were treated with bDMARDs. DMARD treatment modification in relation to the pandemic was observed in 4.0% (7/173) of participants, our results reflect good adherence of the patient/parents to their immunosuppressive treatments. 49.1% (81/165) of the patients did not return to school due to a personal/parental decision in 69.9% (55/81) of cases, due to anxiety of the patient/parents regarding COVID-19. Two patients were diagnosed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: This study suggests that JIA patients treated with DMARDs continued their treatment during the pandemic.

COVID-19 has been the major global health crisis of our time with high psychosocial impact. Vaginismus is a form of female sexual dysfunction and a subset of genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration is painful or impossible. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function of women treated for vaginismus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women treated using dilators between 2018-2019 were included. Data obtained 3 months after comfortable penetration and during the pandemic via telephone interview were compared. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate sexual function and depression. Frequency of sexual intercourse and pain was compared using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Seventy-seven women were included. Mean duration of treatment and number of treatment sessions were 3.5  2.6 months and 4.2  2.6, respectively. There were significant improvements in the FSFI desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain subscales and total score and in the GRISS infrequency, noncommunication, avoidance, non-sensuality, and vaginismus subscales and total score during the pandemic.

Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health-care worker were not associated with increased drinking.

Conclusion In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.","output":"Management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, in the radiology department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isolation of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from oral fluids was first reported in 1997. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PRRSV and/or anti-PRRSV antibodies were present in oral fluids at diagnostic levels. The level and duration of PRRSV and anti-PRRSV antibodies in serum and oral fluids was evaluated in 3 age groups of pigs (4, 8, or 12 weeks of age) inoculated with a type 2 (North American) PRRSV isolate. Serum, buccal swabs, and pen-based oral fluid samples were collected for 63 days following inoculation. Specimens were assayed for PRRSV by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and for anti-PRRSV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was detected by real-time qRT-PCR in serum for approximately 5 weeks and in oral fluids for approximately 4 weeks postinoculation. Pig age at the time of inoculation had no effect on the quantity or duration of virus in oral fluid samples. Low levels of anti-PRRSV antibody were detected in oral fluid samples by ELISA and IFAT. Although the approach remains to be validated in the field, the results of this experiment suggest that pen-based oral fluid sampling could be an efficient, cost-effective approach to PRRSV surveillance in swine populations.","output":"Detection of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection in porcine oral fluid samples: a longitudinal study under experimental conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The editors discuss two recent WHO initiatives on preparing for and responding to global public health threats: the WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines Group and the new revision of the International Health Regulations.","output":"How Is WHO Responding to Global Public Health Threats?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in 67 countries/territories in the Oceania region and the Americas since 2015, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016, due to its strong association with medical complications such as microcephaly and GuillainCBarr Syndrome (GBS). However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. METHODS: We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R(0). RESULTS: Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R(0) for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R(0) of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70C6.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R(0) range of 3.09C5.05. DISCUSSION: Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R(0)) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring.

Secondary outcomes were need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and IMV/death. Subgroup analyses according to SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (Ct) values and inflammation biomarkers were performed. Multivariable marginal structural Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyse the association between remdesivir therapy and the risk of outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Of 1368 hospitalized patients treated with corticosteroids, 1014 (74%) also received tocilizumab, 866 (63%) remdesivir and 767 (56%) tocilizumaba??+a??remdesivir. The 28a? day mortality was 9% in the overall cohort, with an adjusted HR (aHR) of 0.32 (95% CIa??=a??0.17-0.59) for patients receiving CIT. In the latter group, the 28a? day mortality was 6.5%, with an aHR of 1.11 (95% CIa??=a??0.57-2.16) for remdesivir use and there were no differences in secondary outcomes. The risk of primary and secondary outcomes with remdesivir differed by Ct and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients receiving CIT: for 28a? day mortality, the aHR was 0.48 (95% CIa??=a??0.21-1.11) for Ct <25, 0.12 (95% CIa??=a??0.02-0.66) for Ct <25 and <5a? day symptom duration and 0.13 (95% CIa??=a??0.03-0.50) for CRP <38a? mg/L; for IMV and IMV/death, the aHR was 0.32 (95% CIa??=a??0.13-0.77) and 0.33 (95% CIa??=a??0.17-0.63), respectively, in patients with Ct <25.

The need for accurate measurements of tissue behavior during tissue fusion is essential for the continued development and improvement of energy delivery devices. An experimental study was performed to measure the temperatures experienced during tissue fusion and the resulting burst pressure of the fused arteries. An array of thermocouples was placed in the lumen of a porcine splenic artery segment and sealed using a ConMed Altrus thermal fusion device. The temperatures within the tissue, in the device, and at the tissue-device interface were recorded.

The etiology is often elusive. Viruses are some of the most common causes world-wide (1). Here we present a male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure due to Coxsackie B myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36 year old male with history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (35%), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and ventricular tachycardia presented for syncope. He was found to be in cardiogenic shock. Work-up revealed an elevated troponin and NT-proBNP, 0.064 and 5570, acute kidney injury, creatinine 3.28, and congestive hepatopathy. Prior cardiac work-up consisted of a left and right heart catheterization which showed no atherosclerotic disease and elevated filling pressures (Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure 16 and Pulmonary Artery Mean Pressure 33). Cardiac MRI showed global dilation of the cardiac chambers, global hypokinesis, and late gadolinium enhancement of the base and septum. This was suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy and prior myocarditis. Echocardiogram revealed a severe decline in ejection fraction, < 15%, and EKG showed a widened QRS complex with left bundle branch block. Serologic tests were positive for Coxsackie B antibodies. Inotropic support was initiated. Bridge therapy and heart transplant were indicated. However, due to his uninsured status and COVID-19 restrictions, he was unable to be transferred to a heart transplant center. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy was pursued instead. He was clinically stabilized, initiated on GDMT, and was discharged with close follow-up. Even though serologic antibodies lack specificity, given the history, cardiac MRI findings, and diagnosis of NICM, his clinical picture was presumed to be due to Coxsackie B. DISCUSSION: Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium. Viral is the most common cause in Western nations but Rheumatic and Chagas remain prevalent in the developing world. Diagnosis is confirmed with endomyocardial biopsy. This makes it difficult to ascertain the true incidence but there are approximately 1.5 million cases every year. COVID-19 has been frequently associated with myocardial injury and clinical myocarditis. In most cases, tissue diagnosis is lacking. Viral myocarditis can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy through a variety of mechanisms. It is hypothesized to be the result of direct toxicity via receptor mediated entry or an autoimmune response against viral fragments that are not cleared (2). CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, this case highlights the disparities of our healthcare system and how that can directly impact patient care. Viral myocarditis remains a difficult clinical scenario. Treatment is largely supportive but the sequelae of disease can be severe. Antivirals and interferon therapy are promising but further research is needed to explore more pharmacologic options (3).

These people travel to use the natural facilities available at the destination. These facilities, which may include favorable climate, hot springs, pristine nature of rural areas, and so on, are provided to tourists so that they can relax. The present study is a non-experimental survey in which the structural equation modeling method (AMOS22) is used to analyze the data. The statistical population was composed of the tourists visiting the natural attractions of Sarab County, Iran. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire whose validity was confirmed by a panel of experts. To measure the reliability of the research instrument, 30 copies of the questionnaire were completed by some wellness tourists in Sarein Township, Ardabil province in Iran. The results confirmed the good reliability of the questionnaire. Also, the average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) calculated for the studied variables were greater than 0.5 and 0.7, respectively.

METHODS: We analysed the epidemiological data of PCR-confirmed cases over an eight-year period and compared the genomic data of local and imported influenza viruses during a six-month period. RESULTS: Between June 2013 and December 2020, 12,434 patients in the Assistance Publique-Hospitaux de Marseille were diagnosed with an influenza virus infection at the laboratory of the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Mditerranee Infection of Marseille. Half of the patients were below the age of 20. Most of the imported cases were diagnosed outside of epidemic periods. Fourteen genomes of the influenza A virus, including six in international travellers returning from Europe or from the Arabian Peninsula and eight from patients who had not travelled were analysed. Sequences of influenza A/H1N1 virus genomes detected in subjects who had travelled to Saudi Arabia were in the same clade and differed from sequences detected later in a traveller returning from Italy, and in non-travellers who were infected in Marseille. This suggests that influenza viruses imported from Saudi Arabia did not subsequently circulate in Marseille.

We aim to estimate the size of the target population for COVID-19 vaccination at the provincial level in the mainland of China, and summarize the current progress of vaccination programs, which could support local governments in the timely determination and adjustment of vaccination policies and promotional measures. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study of the entire population in the mainland of China, between December 2020 and August 2021. By extracting provincial-stratified data from publicly available sources, we estimated the size of priority target groups for vaccination programs, and further characterized the ongoing vaccination program at the provincial level, including the total doses administered, the coverage rate, and the vaccination capacity needed to achieve the target coverage of 80% by the end of 2021. We used R (version 4.1.0) to complete the descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The size of the target population shows large differences among provinces, ranging from 3.4 million to 108.4 million. As of 31 August, 2021, the speed of vaccine roll-out differs considerably as well, with the highest coverage occurring in Beijing and Shanghai, where 88.5% and 79.1% of the population has been fully vaccinated, respectively. In 22 of 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs), more than 70% of the population was administered at least one dose by August. With the current vaccination capacity, the target of 80% coverage could be achieved by 2021 in 28 PLADs. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities exist in the target population size and vaccination progress across provinces in the mainland of China.

Our analysis is highly pertinent given that the World Health Organisation acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognises that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. In our theoretical treatment, the virion is assimilated to a core-shell nanoparticle, and contributions of various interaction energies to the virion-PM association (electrostatic, hydrophobic, London-van der Waals, etc.) are generically included. We review the limited available literature on the physicochemical features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and identify knowledge gaps. Despite the lack of quantitative data, our conceptual framework qualitatively predicts that virion-PM entities are largely able to maintain equilibrium on the timescale of their diffusion towards the host cell surface. Comparison of the relevant mass transport coefficients reveals that virion biointernalization demand by alveolar host cells may be greater than the diffusive supply. Under such conditions both the free and PM-sorbed virions may contribute to the transmitted dose. This result points to the potential for PM to serve as a shuttle for delivery of virions to host cell targets. Thus, our critical review reveals that the chemodynamics of virion-PM interactions may play a crucial role in the transmission of COVID-19, and provides a sound basis for explaining reported correlations between episodes of air pollution and outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"Chemodynamic features of nanoparticles: Application to understanding the dynamic life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and aqueous biointerfacial zones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although we have a draft sequence of the human genome, little is known about how the chromatin fiber is packed in three-dimensional (3D) space, or how packing affects function (Jackson 2003).

Common sense suggests the fiber cannot be packed randomly, but elucidating what any underlying order might be has proved difficult. First, the foldings of the chromatin fiber have dimensions below the resolution (200 nm) of the light microscope (LM) and so can only be seen by electron microscopy (EM), but then the fixation required can distort structure. Second, DNA is so long and packed so tightly it breaks and/or aggregates easily on isolation.

Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based, interrupted-time-series analysis of lagged independent variables used publicly available observational data from US states during a 60-day period from March 8 to May 18, 2020. The behavioral measures were collected from anonymized cell phone or internet data for individuals in the US and compared with a baseline of January 3 to February 6, 2020. Estimates were also controlled for several state-level characteristics. Exposures Days since school closure, days since a ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, and days since residents voluntarily conducted a 15% or more decline in time spent at work via Google Mobility data. Main Outcomes and Measures The natural log of 7-day mean COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results During the study period, the rate of restaurant dining declined from 1 year earlier by a mean (SD) of 98.3% (5.2%) during the study period. Time at work declined by a mean (SD) of 40.0% (7.9%); time at home increased by a mean (SD) of 15.4% (3.7%). In fully adjusted models, a delay of 1 day in implementing mandatory school closures was associated with a 3.5% reduction (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.965; 95% CI, 0.946-0.984) in incidence, whereas each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.3% reduction (IRR, 0.907; 95% CI, 0.890-0.925) in incidence. For mortality, each day of delay in school closures was associated with a subsequent 3.8% reduction (IRR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.926-0.998), and each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.8% reduction (IRR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.869-0.936). Simulations suggest that a 2-week delay in school closures alone would have been associated with an additional 23 000 (95% CI, 2000-62 000) deaths, whereas a 2-week delay in voluntary behavioral change with school closures remaining the same would have been associated with an additional 140 000 (95% CI, 65 000-294 000) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance In light of the harm to children of closing schools, these findings suggest that policy makers should consider better leveraging the public's willingness to protect itself through voluntary behavioral change.","output":"Association of the Timing of School Closings and Behavioral Changes With the Evolution of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in the US."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

The present systematic review aims to elucidate the recent literature on oral manifestations related to COVID-19 so as to help the dental professionals for better screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed, Science direct, Scopus, and Embase databases was carried out from December 2019 to March 2021 using keywords 'Coronavirus,' 'COVID-19,' 'SARSCoV-2,' 'Oral mucosal lesions,' and 'Oral manifestation.' Additional information was obtained from Cochrane, World Health Organization, and Medscape. The full text articles of case reports and cross-sectional studies were analyzed and included. The review included 25 articles. Results: Four most common oral manifestations were found: gustatory and olfactory dysfunction, xerostomia, oral mucosal lesions, and salivary gland diseases. Vasculitis, opportunistic infections, drug eruption secondary to administration of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), stress, immunosuppression, and hyperinflammatory immune response secondary to COVID-19 might be some of the relevant predisposing factors responsible for the onset of oral manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The early detection of oral symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection could help the clinicians to perform a better screening, and in recognizing early manifestations of the disease. However, the oral manifestations might be misdiagnosed due to subsequent challenge of undergoing oral examinations, hence diverse studies should be undertaken by the researchers to gain a better insight into the topic. ? 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Dexamethasone and remdesivir both have the potential to reduce COVID-related mortality, but their cost-effectiveness in a resource-limited setting with scant intensive care resources is unknown. Methods We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. Results Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 1,111 deaths averted (assuming a 0-30% efficacy of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $11.5 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of the drugs, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to ventilated and non-ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 1,146 deaths, resulting in $139 per death averted, relative to standard care. Conclusions The use of dexamethasone for ventilated and remdesivir for non-ventilated patients is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care.

For the more than 2 million veterans with severe hearing loss, communication is particularly challenging in noisy health care environments such as emergency departments. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe patient and provider perspectives of feasibility and potential benefit of providing a hearing assistance device, a personal amplifier, during visits to an emergency department in an urban setting affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study was conducted in parallel with a randomized controlled study. We completed a semistructured interview with 11 veterans and 10 health care providers to elicit their previous experiences with patient-provider communication in the ED setting and their perspectives on hearing screening and using the personal amplifier in the emergency department. Interview data were analyzed using content analysis and Atlas.ti V8.4 software (Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany). RESULTS: The veteran sample (n = 11) had a mean age of 80.3 years (SD = 10.2). The provider sample included 7 nurses and 3 physicians. In the ED setting, hearing loss disrupts patient-provider communication. Screening for hearing loss in the emergency department was feasible except in urgent/emergent cases. The use of the personal amplifier made communication more effective and less effortful for both veterans and providers.

The study was conducted at two main Hospitals in the Ramadi and Tikrit cities, Iraq, on patients with a chief complaint of parosmia due to COVID-19 disease. The study involved 7 months (August 2020-February 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5%) females. The majority were from age group  30 years (n = 188, 70.1%), housewives (n = 150, 56%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9%) or hyposmia (10.1%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7%).

We develop a machine-learning-based log parser to enable the proposed system to be dynamic and adaptive so that it can adapt to different data and rules. The proposed system enables easy management and understanding of numerical weather forecast workflows by providing provenance graphs.

Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the cardinal epidemiological parameters that adequately explains epidemiology of the outbreak of a disease. In the present study, we employed two statistical regression models such as the linear and polynomial models in order to estimate the CFR, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria (44 days since first reported COVID-19 death). The estimate of the CFR was determined based on cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths reported from 23 March to 30 April 2020. The results from the linear model estimated that the CFR was 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59C3.80%) with R(2) value of 90% and p-value of <0.0001. The findings from the polynomial model suggest that the CFR associated with the Nigerian outbreak is 3.0% and may range from 2.23 to 3.42% with R(2) value of 93% and p-value of <0.0001.

The efficacies of allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral were evaluated against the nonenveloped murine norovirus (MNV), a human norovirus surrogate. The antiviral mechanisms of action were also examined using an RNase I protection assay, a host cell binding assay, and transmission electron microscopy. All three antimicrobials produced significant reductions (P  0.05) in viral infectivity within 6 h of exposure (0.90 log10 to 1.88 log10). After 24 h, the reductions were 2.74, 3.00, and 3.41 log10 for lemongrass oil, citral, and allspice oil, respectively. The antiviral effect of allspice oil was both time and concentration dependent; the effects of lemongrass oil and citral were time dependent. Based on the RNase I assay, allspice oil appeared to act directly upon the viral capsid and RNA. The capsids enlarged from  35 nm to up to 75 nm following treatment. MNV adsorption to host cells was not significantly affected. Alternatively, the capsid remained intact following exposure to lemongrass oil and citral, which appeared to coat the capsid, causing nonspecific and nonproductive binding to host cells that did not lead to successful infection. Such contrasting effects between allspice oil and both lemongrass oil and citral suggest that though different plant compounds may yield similar reductions in virus infectivity, the mechanisms of inactivation may be highly varied and specific to the antimicrobial.

Methods of harnessing this natural pathway are being developed that allow the catalytic degradation of targeted mRNAs using specifically designed complementary small-interfering RNAs (siRNA). siRNAs are being chemically modified to acquire drug-like properties. Numerous recent high profile publications have provided proofs of concept that RNAi may be of therapeutic use. Much of the design of these siRNAs can be accomplished bioinformatically, thus potentially expediting drug discovery and opening new avenues of therapy for many uncommon, orphan, or emerging diseases. Although endogenous human disease targets can theoretically be affected by RNAi therapeutics, nonendogenous targets (eg, viral targets) are attractive and RNAi therapeutics have been shown to act as antivirals in vivo and in vitro. Respiratory viral infections are particularly attractive targets for RNAi therapeutics because the infected cells exist at the air-lung interface, thereby positioning these cells to be accessible to topical administration of siRNA, for example by aerosol. RNAi therapeutics have been shown to be active against respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and influenza in vitro and in vivo resulting in profound antiviral effects.

These techniques are considered curative for small hepatic tumors, with post-ablation outcomes most commonly assessed by an imaging follow up. However, there is increasing evidence of a discrepancy between radiological and pathological findings when ablated lesions are evaluated following liver resection or liver transplantation. A comprehensive review of the available literature reporting the complete pathological response (cPR) following RFA and MWA was performed to estimate the success rate and identify the factors associated with treatment failure. Following RFA, cPR is reported in 26-96% of tumors compared to 57-95% with MWA. Larger tumor size and vessels larger than 3 mm adjacent to the treated tumor are the most important factors identified by previous studies associated with viable residual tumors after RFA. Correlating post-ablation radiological studies with pathological findings shows that computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting residual viable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. There are promising recent reports combining multiprobe ablation techniques with three-dimensional treatment planning software and stereotactic-aiming instrumentation to achieve more than 90% cPR in both small and large HCC tumors. In conclusion, the reported success for achieving cPR in HCC following RFA and MWA is highly variable in different studies and decreases with increasing lesion size and unfavorable tumor characteristics. Very few studies have reported a high rate of cPR.

This study specifically examines the barriers facing Secondary school students, providing suggestions for overcoming these barriers, as gathered from educational technology specialists. A mixed methodology was adopted, with interviews first being carried out with four parents and four students to discover details of the barriers that they face. This helped develop an online survey involving 518 respondents to identify the most frequently cited barriers. Curriculum barriers had the most impact in terms of hindering the learning process, followed by teaching, the learning environment, and social barriers. These four barriers were significantly greater in public-sector schools, compared to private schools. There were also statistically significant differences between male and female students. Moreover, students with access to digital devices and the Internet experienced more teaching barriers, learning environment barriers, and social barriers than those who did not. The survey results were presented to educational technology experts to suggest solutions to the problems of technology adoption. The above experts agreed on the need for a virtual learning environment (VLE) that would help develop students' selflearning, research, and critical thinking skills. ? 2021.

In a previous study, we found that 3-endonexin expressed in vascular endothelial cells was involved in promoting proliferation and angiogenesis partially by facilitating VEGF expression. However, it still remains unclear if 3-endonexin in vascular endothelial cells also employs other mechanisms in regulating angiogenesis. In this study, we utilized a 3-endonexin mutant (M2) carrying a defective nuclear localization sequence to disrupt its nuclear localization and evaluated its ability to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of tube-like vascular structures. In addition, we performed yeast 2-hybrid assay to identify potential functional effectors of 3-endonexin. We found that both wild type 3-endonexin and the M2 mutant could localize to centrosomes in HUVECs and both were able to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. However, the M2 mutant failed to promote VEGF expression in HUVECs. Further, we found that both wild type 3-endonexin and the M2 mutant were capable of binding to ninein, a centrosomal protein with a proangiogenic effect. Knockdown of ninein in HUVECs impeded centrosome localization of wild type 3-endonexin and the M2 mutant and inhibited HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. Taken together, these findings suggest that 3-endonexin interacts with centrosome ninein and contributes to HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures.","output":"3-Endonexin interacts with ninein in vascular endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), CDC currently recommends that persons who have been in close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection should quarantine (stay away from other persons) for 14 days after the last known contact.* However, quarantine might be difficult to maintain for a prolonged period. A shorter quarantine might improve compliance, and CDC recommends two options to reduce the duration of quarantine for close contacts without symptoms, based on local circumstances and availability of testing: 1) quarantine can end on day 10 without a test or 2) quarantine can end on day 7 after receiving a negative test result.? However, shorter quarantine might permit ongoing disease transmission from persons who develop symptoms or become infectious near the end of the recommended 14-day period. Interim data from an ongoing study of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand the proportion of household contacts that had detectable virus after a shortened quarantine period. Persons who were household contacts of index patients completed a daily symptom diary and self-collected respiratory specimens for 14 days. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Among 185 household contacts enrolled, 109 (59%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 at any time; 76% (83/109) of test results were positive within 7 days, and 86% (94 of 109) were positive within 10 days after the index patient's illness onset date.

AYA with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at increased risk for poor psychological and physical well-being. However, to date, there is no published research examining the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV- 19S) in AYA with IBD. AIMS: To assess: 1) the reliability of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in AYA with IBD, and 2) how the fear of COVID-19 relates to key psychological (i.e., anxiety, depression) and physical (i.e., fatigue, pain, disease activity) outcomes in AYA with IBD. METHODS: This ongoing study is a collaboration between Stanford University and ImproveCareNow. Participants included 64 AYA with IBD (M=18.7 years old;52% Ulcerative Colitis;60% female;60% White). Participants completed a one-time online survey. Correlation analyses examined the association between fear of COVID-19, outcome variables (i.e., anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, disease activity), and demographic variables. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses (using the F test) further examined the association between fear of COVID-19, outcome variables, and significant demographic variables (i.e., age, sex). RESULTS: The internal reliability of FCV-19S was measured using Crohnbach's alpha (=0.88), indicating high internal consistency. Correlation analyses demonstrated that fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with anxiety, depression, and fatigue (Table 1). The overall MLR models were significant for anxiety (P<0.001), depression (P=0.002), and fatigue (P=0.031), but not for pain and disease activity. Fear of COVID-19, age, and sex accounted for 29% of the variance in anxiety, 27% of the variance in depression, and 17% of the variance in fatigue. Fear of COVID-19 was not a significant independent predictor of outcomes (Table 2). Female sex was a significant independent predictor for greater levels of anxiety (b=-0.31, P=0.016) and depression (b=-0.35, P=0.008). Older age was a significant independent predictor for greater levels of depression (b=0.29, P=0.031). CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that FCV-19S can be reliably assessed in AYA with IBD. Analyses indicate that fear of COVID-19 is associated with anxiety, depression, and fatigue in AYA with IBD. While COVID-19 fear may be important in explaining these outcomes, female sex independently predicted increased anxiety and depression, and older age independently predicted depression. This highlights the importance of assessing relevant demographic variables (e.g., female sex, young adults) when considering predictors of adjustment in AYA with IBD. Research should further investigate fear of COVID-19 in larger, more diverse IBD populations to better understand its relationship to key IBD outcomes.","output":"Fear of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease: Relationship to psychological and physical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) remains a common medical emergency, with 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis experiencing at least one event in their disease course.

These teenagers have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes than their cisgender peers. Hypotheses to explain this discrepancy are based on increased stress levels surrounding the societal acceptance of gender identity. In this context, elevated allostatic load (AL), which describes the wear and tear sustained by the body in response to repeated exposure to stress, has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to measure AL among TGE adolescents compared with their cisgender peers and assess how AL varies depending on psychological stress and perceived societal acceptance. METHODS: This is an observational proof-of-concept pilot study in which AL will be measured by assaying an array of inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in urine, saliva, and hair samples of TGE youth, and these parameters will be compared with those of age-matched control participants. A questionnaire will assess 4 aspects of psychosocial well-being: presence and management of depression and anxiety, gender identity support by family members, gender minority stress, and degree of perceived safety in the surrounding community. Samples and surveys will be collected at 3 visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). This study will incorporate TGE coinvestigators to inform all aspects of design, data collection, and analysis and ensure that practices are carried out in a respectful and sensitive manner. RESULTS: As of May 2021, the start of data collection for this project has continued to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has both impacted the functioning of the clinic and funding requests. We hope to begin participant recruitment and interviews with coinvestigators soon. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that AL will be primarily influenced by psychological well-being and perceived support and that it will be similar in TGE adolescents and in age-matched cisgender control participants when acceptance and perceived support are high. The results of this study have the potential to increase our understanding of the health challenges faced by TGE individuals during adolescence as well as to show that low levels of acceptance may have detrimental health outcomes secondary to elevated ALs; this may lead to the development of a biomarker profile to assess allostatic stress in TGE patients that can be used to guide management.

METHODOLOGY Over a 16-month period between 2002 and 2004, 141 eligible patients were prospectively recruited from an urban-based teaching hospital in Malaysia. RESULTS Of the 141 patients, 63 (44.7%) patients (age (standard deviation (SD)) 56 (20.0) years; 50.8% male) received a macrolide-containing antibiotic regimen, while 78 (55.3%; age (SD) 57 (20.2) years; 52.6% male) were on a single broad-spectrum antibiotic only. In total, 39 (27.7%) and 102 (72.3%) patients had severe and 'non-severe' pneumonia, respectively. Irrespective of whether they had severe or non-severe pneumonia, there were no significant differences in mortality (non-severe pneumonia, 6.5% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.804; severe pneumonia, 17.6% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.966), need of ventilation (non-severe pneumonia, 8.7% vs. 3.6%, P = 0.274; severe pneumonia, 23.5% vs. 13.6%, P = 0.425) or median length of hospital stay (non-severe pneumonia, 5.5 vs. 5 days, P = 0.954; severe pneumonia, 7 vs. 6 days, P = 0.401) between the two treatment regimens.

The 2-pyridone scaffold was previously identified as a possible key pharmacophore to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). A search for natural, antimicrobial products with the 2-pyridone moiety was undertaken herein, and their calculated potency as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was investigated. Thirty-three natural products containing the 2-pyridone scaffold were identified from the literature. An in silico methodology using AutoDock was employed to predict the binding energies and inhibition constants (K(i) values) for each 2-pyridone-containing compound with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). This consisted of molecular optimization of the 2-pyridone compound, docking of the compound with a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), and evaluation of the predicted interactions and ligand-enzyme conformations. All compounds investigated bound to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), close to the catalytic dyad (His-41 and Cys-145). Thirteen molecules had predicted K(i) values < 1 M. Glu-166 formed a key hydrogen bond in the majority of the predicted complexes, while Met-165 had some involvement in the complex binding as a close contact to the ligand.

Unlike testamentary capacity, the determination of undue influence has been relatively neglected in the medical literature. We aim to improve the understanding of the medical expert role in providing the courts with an opinion on susceptibility to undue influence in estate litigation. METHOD: Medical experts with experience in the assessment of testamentary capacity and susceptibility to undue influence collaborated with experienced estate litigators. The medical literature on undue influence was reviewed and integrated. The lawyers provided a historical background and a legal perspective on undue influence in estate litigation and the medical experts provided a clinical perspective on the determination of susceptibility to undue influence. Together, they provided recommendations for how the medical expert could best assist the court. RESULTS: Susceptibility to undue influence is frequently used in estate litigation to challenge the validity of Wills and is defined as subversion of the testators free will by an influencer, resulting in changes to the distribution of the estate. While a determination of undue influence includes the documentation of indicia or suspicious circumstances under which the Will was drafted and executed, medical experts should focus primarily on the susceptibility of the testator to undue influence. This susceptibility should be based on a consideration of cognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, physical and behavioural function, with evidence derived from the medical documentation, the medical examination, and the history.

Patients were followed over a 68-day period from the time our transplant programme closed due to COVID-19. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate in wait list and transplant populations were equivalent, p=0.69. However, COVID-19 infection was more commonly diagnosed in the wait list patients, p=0.001, who were more likely to be tested by RT-PCR, p=0.0004. Once infection was confirmed, mortality risk was higher in the transplant patients, p=0.015. The seroprevalence in dialysis and transplant patients with undetected infection was 18.3% and 4.6% respectively, p=0.0001.

In this study, we analyse the linguistic experiences of 962 English-speaking individuals from the United Kingdom (UK) who identified as monolinguals. Through an online survey, we found that more than 80% of these monolinguals had learned at least one foreign language, dialect, or type of jargon. More than half of this 80% of monolinguals also used languages they had learned at some point in their lives. Moreover, nearly 40% of all the studied monolinguals confirmed that they had been passively exposed to foreign languages or dialects in their environment; approximately a fourth of these monolinguals who declared exposure to at least one foreign language (or dialect) confirmed that they also used these languages. Furthermore, activities that involved passive use of languages (i.e., activities that require reading or listening but do not require speaking or writing; e.g., watching TV) were occasionally carried out in foreign languages: around 26% of these monolinguals confirmed the passive use of more than one language. Lastly, around 58% of monolinguals who had visited one or more non-English-speaking countries declared the active use of foreign languages during their stay(s). These results suggest that the linguistic experiences of monolinguals from the UK often include exposure to and use of foreign languages. Moreover, these results show the need to consider the specificity of the monolingual language experience when analysing the impact of foreign languages on cognitive functioning, as differences in the language experiences of bilinguals also have divergent impacts on cognition.

Nursing students are being prepared to fill critical gaps in the health care workforce and have played important supportive roles during the current pandemic. Research has focused on vaccine intentions of current health care providers and less is known about students intentions to vaccinate for COVID-19. METHODS: A national sample of undergraduate nursing students were recruited across five nursing schools in five U.S. regions in December 2020. The survey measured perceived risk/threat of COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, perceived safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, sources for vaccine information and level of intention to become vaccinated [primary, secondary (i.e., delayed), or no intention to vaccinate]. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 772 students. The majority (83.6%) had intentions to be vaccinated, however of those 31.1% indicated secondary intention, a delay in intention or increased hesitancy). The strongest predictors of primary intention were positive attitudes (OR = 6.86; CI = 4.39C10.72), having lower safety concerns (OR = 0.26; CI = 0.18C0.36), and consulting social media as a source of information (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.23C1.97). Asian (OR = 0.47; CI = 0.23C0.97) and Black (OR 0.26; CI = 0.08C0.80) students were more likely to indicate secondary intention as compared to primary intention. Students in the Midwest were most likely to indicate no intention as compared to secondary intention (OR = 4.6; CI = 1.32C16.11). CONCLUSIONS: As the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved/recommended in the U.S. nursing students had overall high intentions to vaccinate.

Recent studies have reported that similar to SARS-CoV, this strain expresses a spike protein (S) with a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an enzyme expressed mostly in the endothelium, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and lungs - to facilitate viral entry and intracellular replication. Incidentally, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to physiologic control of both ACE and ACE2 expression, and is an essential system utilized by SARS-CoV-2, albeit with varying schools of thought on how it can affect viral entry. In this paper, we will review current knowledge on the RAAS and how it can be affected by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroid use at the organ and cellular levels. We will then discuss the relevance of these interactions on organ-specific ACE2 expression, and provide scientific insights on how this mechanism can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phases of disease. From the standpoint of other known viruses, we will then aim to discuss the potential uses or restrictions of these drugs in viral infection, and provide an update on relevant studies about COVID-19.","output":"Anti-inflammatory drugs and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: Current knowledge and potential effects on early SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in making appropriate health decisions and ensuring treatment outcomes.

Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task, including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 13.30).

Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.","output":"The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of disease-causing pathogens in wastewater can provide an excellent diagnostic tool for infectious diseases.

METHODS Data were drawn from a cohort of women SWs (N=942, 2010-2019) in Vancouver, Canada. Analyses used descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariable logistic and linear regression using generalised estimating equations (GEE); explanatory and confounder modelling approaches were used. RESULTS 33.9% (n=319) of participants solicited online and 14.1% (n=133) primarily solicited online in the last 6 months in at least one study visit. In multivariable GEE analysis, factors associated with primarily soliciting online included younger age (adjusted OR (AOR) 0.95 per year older, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97), sexual minority status (AOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.10), gender minority status (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.28), higher education (AOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.40), higher sex work income (AOR 1.03 per $100 weekly, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06), being an im/migrant to Canada (AOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.58) and primarily servicing in informal indoor workspaces (AOR 3.47, 95% CI 2.32 to 5.20).

For TEA, a mixture of absolute ethanol and ethiodized oil at a proportion of 1:2 by volume was administered superselectively into the tumor via a microcatheter placed at the feeding arteries. The TEA group and the RFA group consisted of 68 consecutive patients (88 treated target tumors) and 129 consecutive patients (129 tumors), respectively. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all the target tumors in both groups. Grade 3 complication (CIRSE Classification) of prolonged fever occurred in 3 cases with multi-focal and large tumors in the TEA group. There was no statistically significant difference in complete response rate between the TEA group (84/88 or 95.5%) and the RFA group (188/195 or 96.4%) (p = 0.7). Time to progression in the TEA group [median 11.9 months, interquartile range (IQR) 5.6-18 months] was not statistically different from that in the RFA group (median 9.5 months, IQR 3.5-18.7 months) (p = 0.773).

Objective: To examine whether underage youth and young adults who ever used e-cigarettes self-reported changes in access and use of e-cigarettes since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Design, Setting, and Participants: A national, cross-sectional online survey study was conducted from May 6 to May 14, 2020. This sample of 4351 participants aged 13 to 24 years across the US included 2167 e-cigarette ever-users. Quota sampling was used to balance for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 50% having ever used e-cigarettes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in e-cigarette use (increase, decrease, quit, no change, and switch to another product) and access to e-cigarettes (easier or harder, and change in point-of-purchase) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic began, reasons for change, number of times e-cigarettes were used, nicotine dependence, and sociodemographic data. Results: This study focused on 2167 e-cigarette ever-users among 4351 participants who completed the survey. Among 2167 e-cigarette users, a total of 1442 were younger than 21 years and 725 were aged 21 years or older; 1397 were female (64.5%) and 438 identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (20.2%).

However, the interaction between gender, identity and non-vaccination is less well understood, as well as the non-vaccination journey for parents in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, we recruited mothers who have rejected some or all of their child's routine vaccinations in the last 5-10 years. Semi- structured interviews were conducted by phone in late 2020 and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Ten mothers were interviewed. They differed in socio-economic, educational and cultural backgrounds, yet all wanted the same thing: to have happy and healthy children, a goal which they saw as their responsibility and within their control and did not include vaccination. Within this shared parenting priority, identities varied considerably. Most mothers strongly rejected the label or identity of 'anti-vaxxer', preferring alternative terms with less negative social connotations. The decision not to vaccinate was predominantly made by mothers, describing a dynamic where mothers (rather than fathers/partners) were clearly responsible for their children's health, but this largely appeared to be internalized as the mother's role. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of mother's identities within the non-vaccination movement and the pressures on mothers to raise children with 'optimum health' explored in this study suggest that non-vaccination is a largely individual choice that requires nuanced and compassionate engagement to understand the root causes behind this decision.","output":"Motherhood and vaccine refusal in the United Kingdom: A new examination of gender, identity and the journey to contemporary non-vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The induction of a specific antibody response has long been accepted as a serological hallmark of recent infection or antigen exposure.

The degree of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension is different in the pathological stages of DAD. The effects of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension on alveolar sac mechanics in DAD are investigated by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. A dynamic compression-relaxation model for surface tension effects is adopted. Compared to a healthy model, DAD models are created by increasing the tissue thickness and decreasing the concentration of the surfactant. The FSI results show that pulmonary fibrosis is more influential than the surface tension on flow rate, volume, P-V loop, and resistance. The lungs of the disease models become stiffer than those of the healthy models. According to the P-V loop results, the surface tension plays a more important role in hysteresis than the material nonlinearity of the lung tissue.

The presence data were extracted from WHO and Promed archives for the three EID groups and we generated pseudoabsence points within the spatial distribution of the mammalian reservoirs. Various environmental and demographical raster were used to explain the distribution of EIDs. True Skill Statistic and deviance parameters were used to compare the accuracy of the different models.ResultsWe used hierarchical SDM binomial, ZIB with and without iCAR models to map the predictive risk of viral EIDs. ZIB models with autoregression were found to be near perfect in detecting the distribution of EID outbreaks with 70% of the models explained by environmental and demographic drivers. The common influencing drivers amongst the three groups of EIDs analyzed were climatic covariates minimum temperature and rainfall, and human-driven land modifications.ConclusionsOur study results conclude that using SDMs in a Bayesian structure is near perfect detecting hotspots and significant drivers of EID outbreaks. It also maps the sites needing active surveillance, which essential in epidemic prevention, and highlights the influence of human-driven modifications to environment on disease emergence.","output":"Identifying Hotspots in the Distribution of Human Infectious Diseases Using a Bayesian Framework: A Lead to Drivers, Prevention, and Surveillance of Disease Emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Despite evidence that primary stroke center (PSC) certification is associated with improvements in care and outcome, only a minority of hospitals have achieved this certification. We sought to determine hospital-based factors associated with achievement of PSC certification. METHODS We used the 2011 American Hospital Association survey and the 2010 national census for population and household data to identify potential hospital and demographic factors influencing certification as a PSC by the Joint Commission, Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and DNV Healthcare. RESULTS Of the 3696 hospitals to complete the survey, 3069 fulfilling study criteria included 908 PSC (31%) and 2161 non-PSC. Independent hospital characteristics associated with PSC certification were Joint Commission accreditation (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-5.0), increasing size (per quartile in number of beds; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1) and inpatient neurological services (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.4-4.6), number of households per zip code (per 1000 households; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), increasing Hispanic population (by 10% increase; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), and income per household (per $10 000; OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3).

Without public health surveillance, policy makers cannot know where and how the disease is accelerating, decelerating, and shifting. Unfortunately, existing models of COVID-19 contagion rely on parameters such as the basic reproduction number and use static statistical methods that do not capture all the relevant dynamics needed for surveillance. Existing surveillance methods use data that are subject to significant measurement error and other contaminants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a proof of concept of the creation of surveillance metrics that correct for measurement error and data contamination to determine when it is safe to ease pandemic restrictions. We applied state-of-the-art statistical modeling to existing internet data to derive the best available estimates of the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. METHODS: Dynamic panel data (DPD) models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique enables control of various deficiencies in a data set. The validity of the model and statistical technique was tested. RESULTS: A Wald chi-square test of the explanatory power of the statistical approach indicated that it is valid ((2)(10)=1489.84, P<.001), and a Sargan chi-square test indicated that the model identification is valid ((2)(946)=935.52, P=.59). The 7-day persistence rate for the week of June 27 to July 3 was 0.5188 (P<.001), meaning that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 5188 cases 7 days later. For the week of July 4 to 10, the 7-day persistence rate increased by 0.2691 (P=.003), indicating that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 7879 new cases 7 days later. Applied to the reported number of cases, these results indicate an increase of almost 100 additional new cases per day per state for the week of July 4-10. This signifies an increase in the reproduction parameter in the contagion models and corroborates the hypothesis that economic reopening without applying best public health practices is associated with a resurgence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: DPD models successfully correct for measurement error and data contamination and are useful to derive surveillance metrics. The opening of America involves two certainties: the country will be COVID-19Cfree only when there is an effective vaccine, and the social end of the pandemic will occur before the medical end. Therefore, improved surveillance metrics are needed to inform leaders of how to open sections of the United States more safely.

The objective of this paper was to explore the contributions of three transmission routes-contact, droplet, and inhalation-to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel (HCP). The method was quantitative microbial risk assessment, and an exposure model, where possible model parameters were based on data specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus when available. The key finding was that droplet and inhalation transmission routes predominate over the contact route, contributing 35%, 57%, and 8.2% of the probability of infection, on average, without use of personal protective equipment. On average, 80% of inhalation exposure occurs when HCP are near patients. The relative contribution of droplet and inhalation depends upon the emission of SARS-CoV-2 in respirable particles (<10 m) through exhaled breath, and inhalation becomes predominant, on average, when emission exceeds five gene copies per min. The predicted concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of the patient room is low (< 1 gene copy per m3 on average), and likely below the limit of quantification for many air sampling methods. The findings demonstrate the value of respiratory protection for HCP, and that field sampling may not be sensitive enough to verify the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 inhalation to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel. The emission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory droplets of different sizes is a critical knowledge gap for understanding and controlling COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Relative contributions of transmission routes for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel providing patient care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat of pandemic human influenza looms as we survey the ongoing avian influenza pandemic and wonder if and when it will jump species.

Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warranting ICU treatment usually have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are expected to be prone to develop psychological impairments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, which negatively impact quality of life. To date, no effective treatment strategy is available. In the current trial, we aim to assess the effect of an ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life after COVID-19 ICU treatment. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine whether COVID-19-specific ICU-VR, offered 3 months after hospital discharge, improves psychological well-being and quality of life. Secondary objectives are, firstly, to examine the intra-group changes in psychological well-being and quality of life and the inter-group differences in psychological well-being and quality of life during follow-up, up to 12 months after hospital discharge, and secondly, to examine patients satisfaction with and rating of ICU care and aftercare and patients perspectives on ICU-VR. Eighty adult patients treated for COVID-19 in the mixed-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be included and randomized (1:1) to either early or late ICU-VR between June 29 and December 31, 2020. Patients randomized to early ICU-VR will receive the ICU-VR intervention during an outpatient clinic visit 3 months after hospital discharge, whereas patients randomized to late ICU-VR will receive ICU-VR 6 months after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes of this study are psychological well-being, assessed using the Impact of Event ScaleCRevised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life, assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and RAND-36 questionnaires, up to 6 months after hospital discharge.

METHODS: Seventy C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the control, LPS, LPS + DEX, LPS + LY294002, LPS + BEZ235, LPS + DEX + LY294002, and LPS + DEX + BEZ235groups. Lung samples were collected 48 h after LPS treatment. RESULTS: DEX significantly inhibited LPS-induced increases in the lung weight/body weight ratio and lung wet/dry weight ratio, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased the production of proinflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-)in the lungs.

In Malaysia, virtual learning plans were implemented for non-clinical programming, while clinical posting modifications were designed to meet local SOPs. The prolonged enforcement of these modifications to undergraduate medical education will have affected student experiences, including well-being. Since these feelings can relate to perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence, it is important to identify any potential factors that may lead to reduced intrinsic motivation in students. It is also important to consider how demographic features may contribute to student perspectives, which can be studied using the unique diversity represented by Malaysian students. METHODS: A quantitative survey was distributed to Malaysian medical students to assess their overall wellbeing, autonomy in educational decision making, student experiences, and position on changes to graduation timing. Intrinsic components were identified using Principal Component Analysis and were aligned with the three needs for self-determination, namely relatedness, autonomy, and competence. Finally, trends in responses for participants from various sub-populations were assessed using ANOVA testing. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 442 students representing 23 accredited Malaysian medical schools. Upon validation and reliability testing, eight components were identified with themes relating to: mental health, social concerns, communication, timing of modifications, depth of learning, and student-centred learning. Of these, gender was related to mental health, student-centred learning, and delayed graduation, while stage was related to student-centred learning and delayed graduation in addition to concerns about depth of learning and timing of modifications. Interestingly, ethnicity was related to differences in opinions about delayed graduation and income was related to social concerns. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that, while students were satisfied in general with the content and delivery of their programmes given the circumstances, there is evidence to suggest negative effects on emotional wellbeing and expression of student voice, due to the modifications that were made. Additionally, these feelings related to the three motivational needs, suggesting that students were experiencing a dampened motivational profile during the pandemic. Further, motivational profiles were distinct between student sub-groups, providing insight for developing appropriate and inclusive accommodations moving forward.

MCs have long been considered 'reactive bystanders' and 'amplifiers' in inflammatory processes, allergic reactions, and host responses to infectious diseases. However, knowledge about the origin, phenotypes and functions of MCs has increased substantially over the past 50 years. MCs are now known to be derived from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, which, through a process of differentiation and maturation, form a unique hematopoietic lineage residing in multiple organs. In particular, MCs are distinguishable from basophils and other hematopoietic cells by their unique phenotype, origin(s), and spectrum of functions, both in innate and adaptive immune responses and in other settings. The concept of a unique MC lineage is further supported by the development of a distinct group of neoplasms, collectively referred to as mastocytosis, in which MC precursors expand as clonal cells. The clinical consequences of the expansion and/or activation of MCs are best established in mastocytosis and in allergic inflammation. However, MCs have also been implicated as important participants in a number of additional pathologic conditions and physiological processes. In this article, we review concepts regarding MC development, factors controlling MC expansion and activation, and some of the fundamental roles MCs may play in both health and disease.

We report the case of an eight-year-old boy with new-onset type 1 diabetes and an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Case presentation: The eight-year-old boy was hospitalized on December 18th, 2020 due to increased polyuria during the preceding 1 week. Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase and insulin. The Hba1c value was 11.6%. Upon admission, the PCR test for COVID-19 was positive, the duration of the infection was not clear due to the asymptomatic course, and antibodies were initially negative. Significantly elevated antibodies against COVID-19 were detected 15 days later. Conclusion: The laboratory findings led us to the hypothesis that the boy already had an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases (HLA DR3-DQB1*02:01 and DR4-DQB1*03:02 positive).

While death is considered an unavoidable end for LTC home residents, the importance of facilitating a good death is one of the primary goals of palliative and end-of-life care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are well-situated to optimize the palliative and end-of-life care needs of LTC home residents. This study explores the role of NPs in facilitating a dignified death for LTC home residents while also facing increased pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes was recruited. Data were generated using semi-structured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. Three categories were derived: (a) advance care planning and goals of care discussions; (b) pain and symptom management at the end-of-life; and (c) care after death. The findings suggest that further implementation of the NP role in LTC homes in collaboration with LTC home team and external partners will promote a good death and optimize the experiences of residents and their care partners during the end-of-life journey.","output":"Complexity of Nurse Practitioners Role in Facilitating a Dignified Death for Long-Term Care Home Residents during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responses to COVID-19 have included top-down, command-and-control measures, laissez-faire approaches, and bottom-up, community-driven solidarity and support, reflecting long-standing contradictions around how people and populations are imagined in public health-as a 'problem' to be managed, as 'free agents' who make their own choices, or as a potential 'solution' to be engaged and empowered for comprehensive public health. In this rapid review, we examine community-engaged responses that move beyond risk communication and instead meaningfully integrate communities into decision-making and multi-sectoral action on various dimensions of the response to COVID-19. Based on a rapid, global review of 42 case studies of diverse forms of substantive community engagement in response to COVID-19, this paper identifies promising models of effective community-engaged responses and highlights the factors enabling or disabling these responses. The paper reflects on the ways in which these community-engaged responses contribute to comprehensive approaches and address social determinants and rights, within dynamics of relational power and inequality, and how they are sometimes able to take advantage of the ruptures and uncertainties of a new pandemic to refashion some of these dynamics.","output":"Beyond command and control: A rapid review of meaningful community-engaged responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We herein describe and analyse the first outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by human adenovirus type1 (HAdV C type 1), which included immunocompetent patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) of Marseille, France, and occurred between September and October 2012.

The peak age for accidental insertion of objects or liquids is between 6 months and 3 years of age, and it has been hypothesised that given the additional roles parents have taken on, there may be rise in such incidents due to a reduction in structure and supervision. We therefore reviewed attendances with these complaints over a 6 month period in order to determine whether this occurred, and to prioritise public health and safety messaging from our Childrens Emergency Department (CED).ObjectivesTo describe the epidemiology of presentations with accidental insertion of foreign bodies and hazardous liquids, including demographics, and type of hazard. The secondary objective was to evaluate the possibility of any increase in presentations compared to the previous year.MethodsRetrospective chart review study of patients attending a tertiary urban CED between 23rd March and 23rd September 2020. Patients were identified, and data abstracted, using electronic tracking systems and hand searches of notes. Data abstracted included characteristics of the patients, and the objects ingested/inserted, clinical pathway, and outcomes. Results are provided using descriptive statistics. A secondary analysis compared the frequency of attendance with nasal/aural insertions between 1st June C 31st August 2019, and 2020.ResultsWe identified 330 eligible attendances;166 (50.3%) were male, median age was 3 years 8 months (IQR 26C69 months). There was no difference in attendance between days of the week, and the time of incident was equally split between 0800C1559, and 1600C2359. Median CED length of stay was 90 minutes (IQR 45C145 minutes), and 254 (77%) were discharged from CED with no follow up. 22 (1.6%) were had pre-existing social care involvement.Ingestion accounted for 153 (55.4%) presentations, with solid objects most commonly metal (67;23.3%), food (40;13.9%) and toys/lego (32;11.1%). Button batteries and magnets were ingested by 35 (12.2%). Liquids were ingested by 42 (13%), with the most common liquid ingested being liquitabs (8;20%). Insertions accounted for 122 (44.4%) attendances, most commonly in a single nostril (72;25.3%) or ear (39;13.7%). Eight (3.7%) families were provided with advice on preventing recurrence of ingestion/insertion at discharge.The total number of aural/nasal insertions between 1st June-31st August 2020 was 59, compared to 65 in 2019. The insertion location and offending object were similar between years.ConclusionsWe demonstrated no change in frequency of aural/nasal insertions between 2019 and 2020, though comparison between years for ingestions was not possible. We have highlighted areas for improvement in communicating safety messages to families as part of a wider programme of discharge advice, and public health messaging. A significant minority had ingested very hazardous materials, and almost one-quarter required hospital admission or follow-up. These offer particular focus for strengthened messaging to reduce serious injury through prevention.","output":"Whats in there?

We assessed the quality of life of invasively ventilated COVID-19 ARDS survivors. METHODS: We carried out a prospective follow-up study of the patients admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a teaching hospital. Patients affected by COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive ventilation and were successfully discharged home were assessed through the telephone administration of validated tests. We explored survival, functional outcomes, return to work, quality of life, cognitive and psychological sequelae. The main variables of interest were the following: demographics, severity scores, laboratory values, comorbidities, schooling, working status, treatments received during ICU stay, complications, and psychological, cognitive, functional outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 116 consecutive invasively ventilated patients, overall survival was 65/116 (56%) with no death occurring after hospital discharge. Forty-two patients were already discharged home with a median follow-up time of 61 (51-71) days after ICU discharge and 39 of them accepted to be interviewed. Only one patient (1/39) experienced cognitive decline. The vast majority of patients reported no difficulty in walking (32/35:82%), self-care (33/39:85%), and usual activities (30/39:78%). All patients were either malnourished (15/39:38%) or at risk for malnutrition (24/39:62%). Exertional dyspnea was present in 20/39 (51%) patients. 19/39 (49%) reported alterations in senses of smell and/or taste either before or after hospitalization.

The first two types, captured in forward and reverse translocation events, both highlight the role of RdRP-unique motif G in restricting the RNA template movement, corresponding to the rate-limiting step in translocation. By mutating two critical residues in motif G, we obtain the third type of intermediates that may mimic the transition state of this rate-limiting step, demonstrating a previously unidentified movement of the template strand.

From a point of view of chemical warfare protection, the efficiency of BOC-like compounds to degrade the organophosphate simulant fenitrothion was examined. Notwithstanding that no single compound with universal effectiveness was identified, a mixture of only two compounds from this group would be able to satisfactorily cover the proposed decontamination spectrum. In addition, the compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity as a basic safety parameter for potential use in practice.

Multiple community threats may also have cumulative impact on mental health, so examination across several contexts is important. The objective of this study is to report on changes in mental health and well-being in response to the Australian bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized an Experience-Sampling-Method (ESM), using the smartphone-based mood monitoring application, MoodPrism. Participants were prompted once a day to complete a brief survey inquiring about symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several well-being indices, including arousal, emotional valence, self-esteem, motivation, social connectedness, meaning and purpose, and control. Participants were N = 755 Australians (aged 13 years and above) who downloaded and used MoodPrism, between 2018 and 2020. Results showed that anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not during the bushfires. This may be explained by concurrent feelings of social connectedness maintained during the bushfires but not during the pandemic. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, which maintained during the pandemic. Most indices of well-being decreased significantly during the bushfires, and further again during the pandemic. Study findings highlight the unique responses to the bushfire and COVID-19 crises, revealing specific areas of resilience and vulnerability.

METHODS: The Netherlands Heart Registration database was used to compare the volume of elective and acute surgery on the thoracic aorta in 2019 and 2020, starting from week 11 in both years. A sub-analysis was done to assess the impact of the pandemic on high-volume and low-volume aortic centres. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of elective thoracic aortic operations declined by 18% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.82 [0.73C0.91]; P < 0.01]. The decline in volume of elective surgery was significant in both high-volume (IRR 0.82 [0.71C0.94]; P < 0.01) and low-volume aortic centres (IRR 0.81 [0.68C0.98]; P = 0.03). The overall number of acute aortic operations during the pandemic remained similar to that in 2019 (505 vs 499; P = 0.85), but an increased share of these operations occurred at high-volume centres.

Methods: The current ROH model employed by BCBSLA for its members was simplified for State use by focusing on available health factors that could be easily assessed. The simplified model was tested using 2019 BCBSLA membership to predict all future hospitalizations between Jan-Jun 2020. Results: The factors chosen for the new simplified model were age, comorbid conditions (diseases of the circulatory system, Hypertension, etc.) and particular events such as hospital or skilled nursing home facility admission within the past 12 months. The simplified model was shown to be highly predictive of future all-cause hospitalizations. The top 20% of predicted high risk members accounted for 70% of all admissions;AUC was very good at 0.89.

Reasons for nonadherence vary by diagnosis and include not understanding the importance of adherence, low health literacy, lack of adequate self-efficacy, low level of activation and behavioral issues including depression. Patients may lack information about their condition and its prognosis, available treatment alternatives, and other essential information such as how to monitor their eye condition, what to do if vision deteriorates and how to get needed community-based help.

GC-MS with Cold EI is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold sample compounds in the SMB in a fly-through ion source (hence the name Cold EI). GC-MS with Cold EI improves all the performance aspects of GC-MS, enables the analysis of Cannabinoids with OH groups without derivatization, while providing enhanced molecular ions for improved identification, and enables internal quantitation without calibration. We found over 50 cannabinoid compounds including a new one with a Cold EI mass spectrum very similar to delta 9-THC as well as relatively large cannabinoids with molecular weight above m/z = 400.

We present a case report of a 51-year-old man diagnosed with severe respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 that was refractory to antiviral and anti-IL-6 treatment, with a favourable clinical outcome and analytical improvement after treatment with anti-IL-1 (anakinra).","output":"Anakinra, una alternativa potencial en el tratamiento de la infeccin respiratoria grave por SARS-CoV-2 refractaria a tocilizumab./ Anakinra, una alternativa potencial en el tratamiento de la infeccin respiratoria grave por SARS-CoV-2 refractaria a tocilizumab./ Anakinra as a potential alternative in the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 refractory to tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, an echocardiography expert is needed to identify calcium in the aortic valve, and a cardiac CT-Scan image is needed for calcium quantification. When performing a CT-scan, the patient is subject to radiation, and therefore the number of CT-scans that can be performed should be limited, restricting the patients monitoring. Computer Vision (CV) has opened new opportunities for improved efficiency when extracting knowledge from an image. Applying CV techniques on echocardiography imaging may reduce the medical workload for identifying the calcium and quantifying it, helping doctors to maintain a better tracking of their patients. In our approach, a simple technique to identify and extract the calcium pixel count from echocardiography imaging, was developed by using CV. Based on anonymized real patient echocardiographic images, this approach enables semi-automatic calcium identification. As the brightness of echocardiography images (with the highest intensity corresponding to calcium) vary depending on the acquisition settings, echocardiographic adaptive image binarization has been performed. Given that blood maintains the same intensity on echocardiographic imagesbeing always the darker regionblood areas in the image were used to create an adaptive threshold for binarization. After binarization, the region of interest (ROI) with calcium, was interactively selected by an echocardiography expert and extracted, allowing us to compute a calcium pixel count, corresponding to the spatial amount of calcium. The results obtained from these experiments are encouraging. With this technique, from echocardiographic images collected for the same patient with different acquisition settings and different brightness, obtaining a calcium pixel count, where pixel values show an absolute pixel value margin of error of 3 (on a scale from 0 to 255), achieving a Pearson Correlation of 0.92 indicating a strong correlation with the human expert assessment of calcium area for the same images.","output":"Calcium Identification and Scoring Based on Echocardiography.

A docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) motivated the replacement of a thiazole with a benzothiazole unit as a warhead moiety at the P1 site. This modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p, with IC(50) or K(i) values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K(i) values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. The peptidomimetic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics with potent inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) may be summarized as follows: (i) the presence of a benzothiazole warhead at the S1-position; (ii) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam of the S1-site; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and hydrophobic moiety size at the S2-site and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.","output":"Design and synthesis of new tripeptide-type SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors containing an electrophilic arylketone moiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health emergency.

We used the confirmed cases of COVID-19, community mobility data and weather data from the beginning of March 2020 until the end of February 2021 in each province of Java Island. Two decision tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost) in four experimental setups were implemented in this paper.

The Capital City of Jakarta, Banten and the Special Region of Yogyakarta shows the best prediction result in the third experiment which used the community mobility variable as features. While, West Java shows the best result with a combination of all weather variables and mobility, Central Java and East Java with the combination of temperature and mobility. This shows that the community mobility gives an impact on COVID-19 cases in all provinces. The correlation analysis found that the community mobility percentage change in transit stations has a significant role in predicting COVID-19 cases.

We undertook a cost-minimisation analysis comparing the costs to the NHS in Wales of community testing for COVID-19 versus standard hospital testing practices and ambulance conveyancing. We analysed data from patients with suspected COVID-19 between January and February 2020 and applied assumptions of costs from national contractual and reference costs for ambulances, staffing and transportation with market costs at the time of publication. RESULTS: 177 patients with suspected COVID-19 underwent community testing via local NHS organisations between January and February 2020 with a mean age of 46.1 (IQR 27.5C56.3).

Nevertheless, there are no data regarding the optimal risk stratification of patients with diabetes and COVID-19. Since individual C(2)HEST components reflect the comorbidities, we assumed that the score could predict COVID-19 outcomes. Material and Methods: A total of 2184 medical records of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the medical university center were analyzed, including 473 diabetic patients and 1666 patients without any glucose or metabolic abnormalities. The variables of patients baseline characteristics were retrieved to calculate the C(2)HEST score and subsequently the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects were assigned to the following categories: low-, medium- or high-risk. The measured outcomes included: in-hospital mortality; 3-month and 6-month all-cause mortality; non-fatal end of hospitalization (discharged home/sudden-deterioration/rehabilitation) and adverse in-hospital clinical events. Results: A total of 194 deaths (41%) were reported in the diabetic cohort, including 115 in-hospital deaths (24.3%). The 3-month and 6-month in-hospital mortality was highest in the high-risk C(2)HEST stratum. The C(2)HEST score revealed to be more sensitive in non-diabetic-group.

Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20 mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19.

METHODS: The study was performed in the context of health surveillance at the workplaces. We monitored the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs classified by having received the entire vaccine schedule or not; the latter further classified in not vaccinated workers and workers who had received the first shot more than 14 days earlier. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. The cumulative incidence of infections in the period was normalised to 100,000 people. RESULTS: At the end of the observation period, HCWs that had completed the full schedule were at lower infection risk than both unvaccinated HCWs and the workforce who had not yet gained the complete theoretical protection from the vaccine (by 2.4-folds). Overall, ninety-two SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed among HCWs, mostly among not protected workers (52 cases) but none of them showed symptoms requiring hospitalisation.

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of conditions 'covered' by an app, that is, not excluded because the user was too young/old or pregnant, or not modelled; (2) proportion of vignettes with the correct primary diagnosis among the top 3 conditions suggested; (3) proportion of 'safe' urgency advice (ie, at gold standard level, more conservative, or no more than one level less conservative). RESULTS: Condition-suggestion coverage was highly variable, with some apps not offering a suggestion for many users: in alphabetical order, Ada: 99.0%; Babylon: 51.5%; Buoy: 88.5%; K Health: 74.5%; Mediktor: 80.5%; Symptomate: 61.5%; Your.MD: 64.5%; WebMD: 93.0%. Top-3 suggestion accuracy was GPs (average): 82.1%5.2%; Ada: 70.5%; Babylon: 32.0%; Buoy: 43.0%; K Health: 36.0%; Mediktor: 36.0%; Symptomate: 27.5%; WebMD: 35.5%; Your.MD: 23.5%. Some apps excluded certain user demographics or conditions and their performance was generally greater with the exclusion of corresponding vignettes. For safe urgency advice, tested GPs had an average of 97.0%2.5%. For the vignettes with advice provided, only three apps had safety performance within 1 SD of the GPs-Ada: 97.0%; Babylon: 95.1%; Symptomate: 97.8%. One app had a safety performance within 2 SDs of GPs-Your.MD: 92.6%. Three apps had a safety performance outside 2 SDs of GPs-Buoy: 80.0% (p<0.001); K Health: 81.3% (p<0.001); Mediktor: 87.3% (p=1.310-3). CONCLUSIONS: The utility of digital symptom assessment apps relies on coverage, accuracy and safety. While no digital tool outperformed GPs, some came close, and the nature of iterative improvements to software offers scalable improvements to care.","output":"How accurate are digital symptom assessment apps for suggesting conditions and urgency advice?

This organ is partly protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from toxic substances and pathogens carried in the bloodstream. Yet, neurotropic viruses can reach the CNS either by crossing the BBB after viremia, or by exploiting motile infected cells as Trojan horses, or by using axonal transport. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that are critical to control early steps of viral infections. Deficiencies in the IFN pathway have been associated with fatal viral encephalitis both in humans and mice. Therefore, the IFN system provides an essential protection of the CNS against viral infections. Yet, basal activity of the IFN system appears to be low within the CNS, likely owing to the toxicity of IFN to this organ. Moreover, after viral infection, neurons and oligodendrocytes were reported to be relatively poor IFN producers and appear to keep some susceptibility to neurotropic viruses, even in the presence of IFN. This review addresses some trends and recent developments concerning the role of type I and type III IFNs in: i) preventing neuroinvasion and infection of CNS cells; ii) the identity of IFN-producing cells in the CNS; iii) the antiviral activity of ISGs; and iv) the activity of viral proteins of neurotropic viruses that target the IFN pathway.","output":"Antiviral Type I and Type III Interferon Responses in the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus that has a detrimental effect on both livestock and human populations. While there are several diagnostic methodologies available for RVFV detection, many are not sensitive enough to diagnose early infections. Furthermore, detection may be hindered by high abundant proteins such as albumin. Previous findings have shown that Nanotrap particles can be used to significantly enhance detection of various small analytes of low abundance. We have expanded upon this repertoire to show that this simple and efficient sample preparation technology can drastically improve the detection of the RVFV nucleoprotein (NP), the most abundant and widely used viral protein for RVFV diagnostics. RESULTS: After screening multiple Nanotrap particle architectures, we found that one particle, NT45, was optimal for RVFV NP capture, as demonstrated by western blotting. NT45 significantly enhanced detection of the NP at levels undetectable without the technology. Importantly, we demonstrated that Nanotrap particles are capable of concentrating NP in a number of matrices, including infected cell lysates, viral supernatants, and animal sera. Specifically, NT45 enhanced detection of NP at various viral titers, multiplicity of infections, and time points. Our most dramatic results were observed in spiked serum samples, where high abundance serum proteins hindered detection of NP without Nanotrap particles. Nanotrap particles allowed for sample cleanup and subsequent detection of RVFV NP. Finally, we demonstrated that incubation of our samples with Nanotrap particles protects the NP from degradation over extended periods of time (up to 120 hours) and at elevated temperatures (at 37oC). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Nanotrap particles are capable of drastically lowering the limit of detection for RVFV NP by capturing, concentrating, and preserving RVFV NP in clinically relevant matrices. These studies can be extended to a wide range of pathogens and their analytes of diagnostic interest.","output":"The Use of Nanotrap Particles in the Enhanced Detection of Rift Valley Fever Virus Nucleoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: School closures are a subject of debate during the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Because children are not the main driver of COVID-19 transmission in the community, school education must be prioritized in conjunction with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, as determined by local COVID-19 incidence.Methods: We investigated causes and transmission routes of a primary school cluster of COVID-19 that occurred during November and December 2020 in Niigata, Japan.Findings: In the cluster, the virus spread among teachers, then from teachers to students, and then to their family members. This primary school cluster comprised 26 infected patients and included teachers (13/33, 39%), students (9/211, 4%), and family members (4/65, 6%). The secondary attack rate from the three index teachers to the remaining 30 teachers was 33%;however, the rate to students was only 4%. Factors contributing to cluster formation include the fact that two of the index teachers continued working while symptomatic and that the environment and infection prevention measures in the teachers room were inadequate.Interpretation: To open schools safely and without interruption, adequate measures to prevent COVID-19 infection in schools should be emphasized not only for children but also for teachers and their work environment.Funding Information: Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants (20CA2035).Declaration of Interests: The authors have no competing interests to declare.Ethics Approval Statement: Because COVID-19 is designated as an infectious disease by the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases Act, investigations of outbreaks and contact tracing are led by the public health service of health centres, under the authority of the Department of Health and Welfare, Niigata Prefectural Office.

This is achieved by paying attention to how listening situations connected to symphony orchestras digital performances are characterized, how the audience is positioned in relation to the performances and the involved musicians, and furthermore to how the music is represented in text, images and verbal statements. The empirical data comprises the streaming service platforms, and supporting materials, of two concert institutions, London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (GSO), and was gathered during spring 2020, i.e. when concert halls were closed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The article demonstrates how online listening practices are characterized as disconnected from constraints of time and space, and free for anyone to use, anytime and for almost any reason, yet also as strongly connected to temporal and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how the listening practices connected to online symphonic performances are constructed in line with discourses on music as a health resource or as a mood enhancer and emotional regulator, but also in line with romantic aesthetic ideals. Even if the romantic aspects are less explicit, and thus could be perceived to be challenged, such ideals seem to remain uncontested as long as they are combined with more recent discourses on music. ? 2021.

Muscle stiffness is typically evaluated by the Modified Ashworth Scale or the Tardieu Scale; however, these can have low reliability and sensitivity. Ultrasound elastography is an advanced imaging technology that can quantitatively measure the stiffness of a tissue and has been shown to have good construct validity when compared to clinically assessed muscle stiffness and functional motor recovery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to systematically review the literature regarding the change in muscle stiffness as measured by ultrasound elastography in stroke survivors. METHODS: Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies that assessed the change in stiffness of post-stroke muscle stiffness measured by ultrasound elastography following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 29 articles were identified, using either strain elastography and shear wave elastography to measure the stiffness of muscles in stroke survivors, most frequently in the biceps and medial gastrocnemius muscles. The stiffness was typically higher in the paretic compared to the non-paretic or healthy control. Other variations that increased the stiffness include increasing the joint angle and introducing a passive stretch or muscle activation. The paretic muscle has also been assessed pre- and post-treatment demonstrating a decrease in stiffness. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound elastography is a promising imaging technology for determining the muscle stiffness in stroke survivors with need for a standardized imaging protocol.","output":"Ultrasound elastography in the assessment of post-stroke muscle stiffness: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect and mechanism of down-regulating lncRNA TTTY15 targeting miR-4500 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of A172 glioma cells.

Complementary binding sites of TTTY15 and miR-4500 were predicted with Starbase software, and the targeting relationship was validated with a luciferase reporter system. A172 glioma cells were divided into Control, si-NC (transfected with control siRNA), si-TTTY15 (transfected with TTTY15 siRNA), si-TTTY15+Anti-miR-NC (co-transfected with TTTY15 siRNA and inhibitor control) and si-TTTY15+Anti-miR-4500 (co-transfected with TTTY15 siRNA and miR-4500 inhibitor) groups. Proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, and the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins of the A172 glioma cells were respectively detected with CCK-8, flow cytometry, Transwell chamber and Western blotting assays. RESULTS: The expression of TTTY15 in glioma cells and glioma tissues have both increased. The expression levels of TTTY15 and miR-4500 in glioma tissues were inversely correlated. TTTY15 and miR-4500 are mutually targeted. Compared with those of the Control and si-NC groups, the glioma cells in the si-TTTY15 group showed increased level of miR-4500, decreased survival rate, increased apoptosis rate, enhanced cell migration and invasion, increased expression of Bax protein, and decreased expression of Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins (P<0.05).

In study 1, of 60 cows so treated, 47 were in the intended periovulatory phase when a fixed-time insemination was given 72 hours after the prostaglandin. In study 2, detailed observations were made in 32 cows treated as in study 1, using ultrasound to determine the optimum time to administer the second dose of GnRH. Ovulation was most effectively synchronised by giving GnRH 56 to 60 hours after the prostaglandin. Study 3 investigated the timing of ovulation when no initial dose of GnRH was given. Six cows were injected with prostaglandin on day 12 of the oestrous cycle, followed by GnRH 60 hours later. Five of the six cows ovulated 24 to 36 hours after GnRH, an equivalent timing and synchrony to that in study 2, in which a dose of GnRH had been given seven days before prostaglandin. In study 4, an initial dose of GnRH was given to six cows late (day 17) in the oestrous cycle, and prostaglandin seven days later. The GnRH treatment delayed luteolysis in five of the cows so that they were responsive to the prostaglandin and ovulated 24 to 36 hours after the second dose of GnRH. The use of GnRH (day 0) - prostaglandin (day 7) - GnRH (day 9.5) appears to be an effective means of synchronising ovulation in most cows.","output":"Development of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and prostaglandin regimen for the planned breeding of dairy cows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in the United States.

In free-living conditions, periods of device removal (non-wear) can lead to misclassification of behavior with consequences for research outcomes and clinical decision making. Common methods for non-wear detection are limited by data transformations (e.g., activity counts) or algorithm parameters such as minimum durations or absolute temperature thresholds that risk over- or under-estimating non-wear time. This study aimed to advance non-wear detection methods by integrating a rate-of-change criterion for temperature into a combined temperature-acceleration algorithm. METHODS: Data were from 39 participants with neurodegenerative disease (36% female; age: 45C83 years) who wore a tri-axial accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their wrist 24-h per day for 7-days as part of a multi-sensor protocol. The reference dataset was derived from visual inspection conducted by two expert analysts. Linear regression was used to establish temperature rate-of-change as a criterion for non-wear detection. A classification and regression tree (CART) decision tree classifier determined optimal parameters separately for non-wear start and end detection. Classifiers were trained using data from 15 participants (38.5%). Outputs from the CART analysis were supplemented based on edge cases and published parameters. RESULTS: The dataset included 186 non-wear periods (85.5% < 60 min). Temperature rate-of-change over the first five minutes of non-wear was ? 0.40  0.17 C/minute and 0.36  0.21 C/minute for the first five minutes following device donning. Performance of the DETACH (DEvice Temperature and Accelerometer CHange) algorithm was improved compared to existing algorithms with recall of 0.942 (95% CI 0.883 to 1.0), precision of 0.942 (95% CI 0.844 to 1.0), F1-Score of 0.942 (95% CI 0.880 to 1.0) and accuracy of 0.996 (0.994C1.000). CONCLUSION: The DETACH algorithm accurately detected non-wear intervals as short as five minutes; improving non-wear classification relative to current interval-based methods. Using temperature rate-of-change combined with acceleration results in a robust algorithm appropriate for use across different temperature ranges and settings. The ability to detect short non-wear periods is particularly relevant to free-living scenarios where brief but frequent removals occur, and for clinical application where misclassification of behavior may have important implications for healthcare decision-making.

METHOD: A descriptive qualitative study with 12 physicians, nurses and managers of seven different care pathways who were involved in the implementation of a tailored VBHC methodology was conducted. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data guided by all factors of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). FINDINGS: The method designed for the implementation of a tailored VBHC methodology was appointed as a structured guide for the process. Throughout the implementation process, leadership and team dynamics were considered as important for the implementation to succeed. Also, sharing experiences with other value teams and the cooperation with external Information Technology (IT) teams in the hospital was mentioned as desirable. The involvement of patients, that is part of the VBHC methodology, was considered useful in the decision-making and improvement of the care process because it gave better insights in topics that are important for patients. The time-consuming nature of the implementation process was named as barrier to the VBHC methodology. On top of that, the shaping of the involvement of patients and the ongoing changes in departments were established as difficult.

METHODS: Data of inpatients before and after implementation of new requirements were retrospectively analyzed, including infection rate, use of alcohol-based hand cleaner, anatomical sites of infections, pathogen species, infection by multi-drug resistant species, and use of different antibiotics. RESULTS: The HAI rate was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019 (P < 0.05), and the CAI rate was significantly higher in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018 (P < 0.001). Lower respiratory tract infections were the most common HAI during all years, with no significant changes over time. Lower respiratory tract infections were also the most common CAI, but were significantly more common in 2018 and 2019 than 2020 (P < 0.001). There were no changes in upper respiratory tract infections among HAIs or CAIs. Most HAIs and CAIs were from Gram-negative bacteria, and the percentages of fungal infections were greater in 2019 and 2020 than 2018.

The aim of this study was to assess the excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. METHODS: We analysed data on deaths that occurred in the first 4 months of 2020 provided by the health protection agencies (HPAs) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths through a Poisson generalised additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. RESULTS: We estimated that there were 5740 (95% credible set (CS) 5552C5936) excess deaths in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS 3535C3877) in Brescia, corresponding to a 2.55-fold (95% CS 2.50C2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS 1.89C1.98) increase in the number of deaths. The excess death wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly 2 weeks after the introduction of lockdown measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI 9.1C9.7). CONCLUSION: Excess mortality was significantly higher than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on the health system.

The emergence of targeted environmental DNA detection methodologies provides an opportunity to enhance information about their past and present distributions. In this study we successfully developed species-specific droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) assays to detect A. dieffenbachii and A. australis DNA in water and sediment samples. Assays utilized primers and probes designed for regions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b and 16S ribosomal RNA genes in A. dieffenbachii and A. australis, respectively. River water samples (n = 27) were analyzed using metabarcoding of fish taxa and were compared with the ddPCR assays. The presence of A. dieffenbachii and A. australis DNA was detected in a greater number of water samples using ddPCR in comparison to metabarcoding. There was a strong and positive correlation between gene copies (ddPCR analyses) and relative eel sequence reads (metabarcoding analyses) when compared to eel biomass.

METHODS TL, subjective morning fatigue (MF), and supine HRV were monitored during a 12-week period. RESULTS During a high-TL period (training camp), MF and heart rate increased and vagally mediated HRV variables decreased. MF increased and stayed high 3 days after the camp despite decrease in TL. In contrast, 4 days after the camp, heart rate decreased and vagally mediated HRV variables increased, reflecting parasympathetic hyperactivity. Elevated MF and suboptimal training performance led to a PCR test decision, which returned positive. After a 10-day training suspension, TL was progressively increased with low MF and high vagal tone. The athlete was able to return to competition 17 days after medical clearance for return to participation and 1 week later beat his indoor 60-m personal best.

Is the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue dependent upon exercise intensity above critical power (CP) when W' (the curvature constant of the power-duration relationship) is depleted? What is the main finding and its importance? The magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue is the same after two bouts of supra-CP cycling (3 versus 12 min) when controlling for W' depletion but is larger for individuals of greater anaerobic capacity after the shorter bout and smaller for individuals of greater aerobic capacity after the longer exercise bout. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms underpinning exercise above CP. ABSTRACT The aim of the present study was to test whether the development of neuromuscular fatigue within the severe-intensity domain could be linked to the depletion of the curvature constant (W') of the power-duration relationship. Twelve recreationally active men completed tests to determine peak oxygen consumption, critical power (CP) and W', followed by two randomly assigned constant-load supra-CP trials set to deplete W' fully in 3 (P-3) and 12 min (P-12). Pre- to postexercise changes in maximal voluntary contraction, potentiated quadriceps twitch force evoked by single (Qpot ) and paired high- (PS100) and low-frequency (PS10) stimulations and voluntary activation were determined. Cycling above CP reduced maximal voluntary contraction (P-3, -20  10% versus P-12, -15  7%), measures associated with peripheral fatigue (Qpot , -35  13 versus -31  14%; PS10, -38  13 versus -37  17%; PS100, -18  9 versus -13  8% for P-3 and P-12, respectively) and voluntary activation (P-3, -12  3% versus P-12, -13  3%; P < 0.05), with no significant difference between trials (P > 0.05). Changes in maximal voluntary contraction and evoked twitch forces were inversely correlated with CP and peak oxygen consumption after P-12, whereas W' was significantly correlated with changes in Qpot and PS10 after P-3 (P < 0.05). Therefore, the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue does not depend on exercise intensity when W' is fully exhausted during severe-intensity exercise; nonetheless, exploration of inter-individual variations suggests that mechanisms underpinning exercise tolerance within this domain differ between short- and long-duration exercise.","output":"The magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue is not intensity dependent when cycling above critical power but relates to aerobic and anaerobic capacities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Treatment of type 4 hiatal hernia using a minimally invasive approach is challenging and requires good familiarity with this technique. METHODS From October 1992 to August 2010, 40 patients with a median age of 68 years underwent laparoscopic anterior hemifundoplication surgery for upside-down stomach and were included in our prospective study. The median symptoms duration was 5 years. The leading clinical symptoms were postprandial, epigastric, or retrosternal pain (80%), heartburn (78%), regurgitation (80%), dysphagia (53%), and anemia (48%). Preoperative evaluation included blood test, chest X-ray, upper endoscopy, and barium swallow. In some patients an esophageal 24-h pH study and esophageal manometry were performed. The median follow-up was 46 months using a standardized questionnaire, including Smiley score, modified Visick score, gastrointestinal quality-of-life index (GQLI), and specific reflux symptoms score. RESULTS Surgery was finished laparoscopically in 39 patients (97%). One patient had to be converted to an open procedure because of severe adhesions. Mesh hiatoplasty had to be performed in one patient due to a large hiatal defect. Median operative time was 160 min (range=90-275) and median blood loss was 5 ml (range=0-300). Seven patients (18%) presented with acute symptoms. Intraoperative technical complications occurred in four patients (10%) and nontechnical complications in two cases (5%). Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (range=2-17). Postoperative complications occurred in two patients (5%): one pleural effusion and one surgical emphysema. There was no mortality or symptomatic recurrence. All scores showed significant improvement and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic treatment of type 4 hiatal hernia is safe.

This survey aimed to identify: changes to herbal medicine practice since the start of the pandemic, common herbs used to support people with COVID-19 symptoms and types of advice patients are seeking from herbal practitioners. Methods: We developed a mixed-methods e-survey for herbal practitioners, disseminated in June 2020 through practitioner professional bodies and social media. Quantitative results were analysed descriptively and qualitative results were analysed using basic content analysis. Results: Findings from 59 complete responses indicated that most practitioners have moved to phone or video consultations only, whilst 37% had observed a decline in patients with other conditions. 56% respondents reported seeing patients with COVID-19 symptoms and 27% seeing patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Herbal practitioners reported that patients most commonly asked for information about herbs to support the immune system (46/59, 78%) and herbs to support them during COVID-19 symptoms (36/59, 61%), although the percentage of patients asking for COVID-19 advice varied. Practitioners described using a range of herbs to support people with COVID-19 symptoms, most commonly Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (15/31, 48%), Echinacea spp. (13/31, 42%) and Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees (8/31, 26%). Practitioners also recommended vitamin D (14/29, 48%) and C (8/29, 28%). Herbal practitioners main sources of information about COVID-19 were webinars from other herbalists (56%), research databases (58%) and NHS guidance (49%).

Materials & Methods This cross-sectional retrospective study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital's Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery department. All the four-year surgical procedures data were reviewed from August 2017 to August 2021. After extracting data from the hospital database software, a databank was generated in SPSS version 24.0. Average cases per month were calculated, and the data were stratified into three groups, Pre-COVID, COVID, and Post-COVID. Tables and charts were generated for the representation of data. Results The total number of patients that underwent cardiovascular and thoracic procedures during the years 2017-2021 were 3,624, with male predominance (71.5%). Procedures were divided into Pre-COVID (68.5%), COVID (15.2%) and Post-COVID (16.3%) groups. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) was the most common procedure throughout the study duration (56.8%) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (29 procedures/month). Congenital Heart Surgeries (16.6%) and Valvular surgeries (11.5%) were next on the list. However, congenital heart surgeries were most affected during the pandemic (16 to 5 procedures/month). The average number of surgeries per month peaked at 2017 (135 procedures/month) and after that declined to its low of 46/month during the COVID-19 pandemic (The year 2020). Conclusion Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgeries have significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the Coronary Artery Bypass (CABG) and Congenital Heart Surgeries. CABG procedures, however, remained the highest performed surgery even during the pandemic due to their emergent nature. Thoracic, vascular, and combined surgeries have stayed almost constant. The year 2020 (COVID-19 year) saw the lowest number of surgeries performed per month.

This study examines the experiences of oncologists who engage in complex decision-making regarding the use of chemotherapy in seriously ill persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between January 2020 and August 2020, the authors conducted semistructured, in-depth individual interviews with 22 purposefully sampled oncologists from practices enrolled in the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium. Transcripts were double-coded and reconciled by consensus using qualitative data analysis software for thematic analysis. Results: Among the thematic clusters we identified, one was related to conundrums created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this presentation, we report the results pertaining to three themes within this cluster: (1) the ethical dilemmas faced by oncologists due to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for both patients and oncologists to manage uncertainty and emotions, and (3) the importance and complexity of integrating technology and communication for seriously ill persons. Oncologists grappled with several conundrums including resource scarcity, resource allocation, delays in care, a duty to promote equity and non-abandonment, high levels of uncertainty and fear, and the importance of advanced care directives and end-of-life care planning. Nonabandonment featured as a coping mechanism for increased stress, and integration of communication with telemedicine was frequent and necessary. Conclusions: This study offers an indepth exploration of the conundrums faced by oncologists due to the COVID-19 pandemic and how they navigated them. Optimal decision-making for seriously ill persons with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic must include open acknowledgement of the ethical dilemmas faced, the heightened emotions experienced by both patients and their oncologists, and the urgent need for integrating technology with compassionate communication in determining patient preferences.","output":"'I'm being forced to make decisions I have never had to make before': Oncologists and the conundrums created by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wide-scale assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies is critical to understanding population seroprevalence, correlates of protection, and the longevity of vaccine-elicited responses. Most SARS-CoV-2 studies characterize antibody responses in plasma/sera. While reliable and broadly used, these samples pose several logistical restrictions, such as requiring venipuncture for collection and a cold chain for transportation and storage. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these barriers as they can be self-collected by fingerstick and mailed and stored at ambient temperature. Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and epitope profiles using phage display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format. This study supports the adoption of DBS for numerous SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization assays. IMPORTANCE Plasma and sera isolated from venous blood represent conventional sample types used for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses after infection or vaccination. However, collection of these samples is invasive and requires trained personnel and equipment for immediate processing. Once collected, plasma and sera must be stored and shipped at cold temperatures. To define the risk of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the longevity of immune responses to natural infection and vaccination, it will be necessary to measure various antibody features in populations around the world, including in resource-limited areas. A sampling method that is compatible with these settings and is suitable for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is therefore needed to continue to understand and curb the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Binding and Neutralization in Dried Blood Spot Eluates and Paired Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study were to synthesise and compare pandemic preparedness strategies issued by the federal and provincial/territorial (P/T) governments in Canada and to assess whether COVID-19 public health (PH) measures were tailored towards priority populations, as defined by relevant social determinants of health. METHODS: This scoping review searched federal and P/T websites on daily COVID-19 pandemic preparedness strategies between 30 January and 30 April 2020. The PROGRESS-Plus equity-lens framework was used to define priority populations. All definitions, policies and guidelines of PH strategies implemented by the federal and P/T governments to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were included. PH measures were classified using a modified Public Health Agency of Canada Framework for Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. RESULTS: A total of 722 COVID-19 PH measures were issued during the study period. Of these, home quarantine (voluntary) (n=13.0%; 94/722) and retail/commerce restrictions (10.9%; n=79/722) were the most common measures introduced. Many of the PH orders, including physical distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures or retail/commerce restrictions began to be introduced after 11 March 2020. Lifting of some of the PH orders in phases to reopen the economy began in April 2020 (6.5%; n=47/722). The majority (68%, n=491/722) of COVID-19 PH announcements were deemed mandatory, while 32% (n=231/722) were recommendations. Several PH measures (28.0%, n=202/722) targeted a variety of groups at risk of socially produced health inequalities, such as age, religion, occupation and migration status. CONCLUSIONS: Most PH measures centred on limiting contact between people who were not from the same household.

As part of the course, students completed the ID simulation lab, during which they were presented with common ID syndromes (suspected tuberculosis, C. difficile colitis, and neutropenic fever) and asked to select the proper PPE prior to interacting with standardized patients. ID physicians acted as the patients and then conducted feedback sessions, which focused on PPE choice, donning and doffing techniques, and ID diagnosis and management principles. RESULTS: More than 500 medical students participated between 2016 and 2020, demonstrating the feasibility of the experience. The average exam scores were above 80%, and the average student evaluation score of the session was 8.9 out of 10, demonstrating acceptability. DISCUSSION: The ID simulation lab allowed students to reinforce didactic teaching about PPE, dispel common misconceptions, and receive real-time feedback from ID clinicians. Availability of the lab and facilitators were limiting factors. Future work will focus on better understanding the efficacy of the sessions.","output":"Infectious Diseases Simulation for Medical Students: Experiential Instruction on Personal Protective Equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To quantify the optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) and compare the measurements with a healthy control group.

The sale never took place, but the water shutoff, too, became the largest ever in American history, with over 141,000 homes subjected to water disconnections over a period of over six years. The governor of the State of Michigan ordered that the shutoffs be temporarily suspended for the duration of the COVID-19 health emergency in March 2020, and that water be restored to homes that had been disconnected from water services. Human and civil rights activists and health officials have long sought the end of the shutoff campaign based on its disproportionate impact upon Black people, its subjection of people to sub-human living conditions and serious health risks, and its ineffectiveness. Pleading violations of civil and human rights laws, however, has proven unavailing;even condemnations from the United Nations have not sufficed to convince the City of Detroit or the State of Michigan to put a permanent end to the water shutoffs, their lack of success and high human cost notwithstanding. This Essay uses contract theory to clarify the relationships between the people of Detroit and the local, state, and federal governmental bodies exercising jurisdiction over them, and to explain why the shutoffs persist. A racial contract exists amongst Michigans white body politic which seeks the exploitation of Black people and resourcesincluding Detroits water. Performance of the contract requires the dehumanization and exclusion of Black Detroiters in order to establish and maintain a rent-seeking order in which Black people effectively subsidize the delivery of water and sewage services to white suburbanites who view Black governance and Black proprietorship as a breach of the social order for which they bargained. The City of Detroit has been able to rely on anti-Black narratives and beliefs to create the mirage of a contractual relationship with Detroit residents that Detroiters have breached;in reality, however, Black people lack contractual capacity under the terms of the racial contract, and the City of Detroit and the regional water authority treat Black peoples use of water as an externality resolved through taxation.","output":"Coming to Terms: Applying Contract Theory to the Detroit Water Shutoffs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After noting the cancellation of the April 2020 EPF Conference in Vienna due to coronavirus, this letter details the history of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association and how each contributed to the development of the field of psychoanalysis A close collaboration that began in 2005 between the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association led in 2006 to the founding of a joint \\"Wiener Psychoanalytische Akademie\\" (Vienna Psychoanalytic Academy), a centre for psychoanalysis and its applications that is also accessible to the public It provides an institutional framework for training, transmission and research work, interdisciplinary exchange and project-based collaboration It forms a bridge between those who practise and advance classical psychoanalysis and people who are clinically or theoretically interested in psychoanalysis without immediately seeking a full psychoanalytic training All three Viennese psychoanalytic institutions work today alongside each other, separated by a fire wall and connected by mobile internal walls that-as soon as they are opened-provide space for common, well-equipped events and an educational centre for lectures, seminars and conferences (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Letter from Vienna"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction There has been a great concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has interfered with burn care The feeling has been that resources have been shifted to treating the COVID patients and that \\"shelter-in-place\\" requirements have reduced the risks for burn injury The ABA and other organizations have sent biweekly surveys in order to determine how the pandemic has interfered with burn care Despite these concerns, we seemed very busy Methods The inpatient data was collected in our adult and pediatric burn centers between January 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 Results During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in burn admissions in both adult and pediatric centers At the same time there were 1270 COVID-19 adult admissions and 4 COVID-positive admissions at the pediatric center In the adult center, there was increase from 414 total admissions from fiscal year 2019 (7/2018-6/2019) of 414 to 495 for fiscal year 2020 (7/2019-6/2020) The average daily census also increased from 18 33 to 18 36 during the same period The monthly number of burn admissions increased from 38 5/month for the last six months of 2019 to 44/month for the first six months of 2020 The admission rate continued in July (41) and August (47) In the first 8 months of 2020, there were 356 admissions with a mean TBSA of 11 3% There were many large burns admitted in late summer The mean TBSA of the 12 bed ICU on September 11, 2020 was 60 6% (range 25C85%) In the pediatric unit, there were 174 admissions through July 2020, a 6% increase from the preceding same period There was a 6% decrease in burn reconstruction Conclusions Despite a significant burden of COVID-19 patients, burn admissions also increased at the same time There was no evidence that \\"shelter-in-place\\" requirements changed the risk for burn injuries Resources for critical care needs should not be siphoned away from burn centers during pandemics Risky behaviors leading to burns do not go away despite new health crises","output":"42 COVID-19 Slowdown?

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We express the robustness of inferences as the amount of data that must be replaced to change the conclusion and relate this to the fragility of trial results used for dichotomous outcomes. We illustrate our approach in the context of an RCT of hydroxychloroquine on pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and a cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of antihypertensive treatments on stroke. RESULTS: We developed the Robustness of an Inference to Replacement (RIR), which quantifies how many treatment cases with positive outcomes would have to be replaced with hypothetical patients who did not receive a treatment to change an inference. The RIR addresses known limitations of the Fragility Index by accounting for the observed rates of outcomes. It can be used for varying thresholds for inference, including clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Because the RIR expresses uncertainty in terms of patient experiences, it is more relatable to stakeholders than P-values alone. It helps identify when results are statistically significant, but conclusions are not robust, while considering the rareness of events in the underlying data.","output":"Hypothetical case replacement can be used to quantify the robustness of trial results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Antimicrobial resistance represents an urgent health dilemma facing the global human population.

Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males.

OBJECTIVE: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. SETTING: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. METHODS: Regression was used to find the relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R(2) = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature is on SARS-CoV-2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase is associated with a 1% decreaseand a one degree decrease could be associated with a 3.7% increasein the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. This model of the effect of decreasing temperatures can only be verified over time as the pandemic proceeds through colder months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","output":"Evidence and magnitude of the effects of meteorological changes on SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Levels of personal anxiety are inevitably escalating in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including individual fear of infection, grief at the loss of loved ones and reactive depression related to loss of employment and livelihood.

METHODS We examined responses of pre-clinical medical students to the remote electronic learning in terms of quality of and satisfaction with teaching and technical support, attendance to classes, and the desire to continue electronic learning in the post-epidemic era. A survey of responses from first-year students at the Adelson School of Medicine was conducted. To optimize the reliability of the survey, a single research assistant conducted telephone interviews with each student, using a structured questionnaire concerning aspects of participation and satisfaction with teaching and with technical components of the remote electronic learning. RESULTS With 100% response rate, the students reported high satisfaction with the electronic learning regarding its quality, online interactions, instructions given, technical assistance, and availability of recording for future studies. Most of the students (68.6%) noted a preference to continue < 90% of the learning online in the post-outbreak era. A high level of overall satisfaction and a low rate of technical problems during electronic learning were significantly correlated with the desire to continue online learning (P < 0.01).

The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic led to a national lockdown and the temporary suspension of several non-urgent healthcare activities, including cancer screening. This paper aims to describe the results of a national survey carried out by the National Centre for Screening Monitoring (ONS) on cervical, breast and colorectal cancer screening activities in 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was conducted by ONS in 2020 to assess: the number of screening invitations by Region; the volumes of screening tests and the attitude to attend the screening programme compared to 2019; the number of delayed diagnoses of malignant or pre-malignant lesions caused by the slowing down of screening programmes, based on the average Region-specific screening detection rate for cervical, breast and colorectal cancers. RESULTS: Screening tests for breast, colorectal and cervical cancer decreased by 37.6%, 45.5% and 43.4% in 2020 compared with 2019. In 2020 the estimated numbers of undiagnosed lesions are: 3,324 breast cancers, 1,299 colorectal cancers, 7,474 colorectal advanced adenomas and 2,782 CIN2 or more severe cervical lesions. Participation in cancer screening programmes decreased by 15%, 15% and 20%, for cervical, breast and CRC screening, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An urgent call to action is needed to prevent further delays and to limit the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnosis and prevention.","output":"Cancer screening programmes in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic: an update of a nationwide survey on activity volumes and delayed diagnoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Among the drug targets being investigated for SARS-CoV-2, the viral main protease (M(pro)) is one of the most extensively studied. M(pro) is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites. It is highly conserved and has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Therefore, M(pro) inhibitors are expected to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as M(pro) inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported M(pro) inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12, using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of M(pro) by these six compounds is nonspecific and that the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT). Without DTT, these six compounds inhibit not only M(pro) but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and 2A(pro) and 3C(pro) from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC(50) values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that these six compounds are nonspecific SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.","output":"Ebselen, Disulfiram, Carmofur, PX-12, Tideglusib, and Shikonin Are Nonspecific Promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical staff is vital for helping society through a health crisis, human-made or natural disaster, and pandemic.

It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches.

The consequences of not vaccinating against human papilloma virus (HPV) of youngs for their future reproductive health are far-reaching. In Croatia, HPV vaccination is voluntary and free for all school children and students. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: Rate of HPV vaccination in eighth grade students before the epidemic school year 2018/19, at the onset of the epidemic 2019/20 and 2020/21 in the midst of the epidemic, Croatia in the city of Koprivnica and 11 municipalities in the Koprivni?ko-kri?eva?ka County. The research included 1530 children of eighth grade during three school years in the city of Koprivnica and 11municipalities. Data were collected by the School Health Service. Before the panidemic, vaccinations took place at school, and during the epidemic exclusively in school medicine practices. Completely vaccinated are considered those vaccinated with two or three doses depending the student age. RESULTS: Fully vaccinated students 2018/2019 is 54.2% (277/511), urban area 48.0% (133/277) and rural area 61.5% (144/234). 2019/2020 62.0% (330/532) of students were vaccinated, urban area 56.3% (160/284) and rural area 68.6% (170/248). Coverage of girls with full vaccination 2018/2019 is 63.4% and boys 46.6%. In 2019/2020 71.8% girls and 52.3% boys were fully vaccinated. In 2020/2021 the first dose received 53.4% (260/487), girls 65.3% and boys 43.4%. The second dose did not received in 2018/2019 5.2% students and 2019/2020 8.8%. The main reason in the rural area is the distance from school clinics and the inability to vaccinate children at school. LESSONS: In the school year 2019/2020 there was an increase in vaccination compared to 2018/2019 of 7.8%, despite difficult conditions.

The policy was revised in three subsequent stages (Lockdown 2.0-4.0 between 15 April to 18 May 2020), and restrictions were lifted (Unlockdown 1.0) on 1 June 2020. This study evaluated the effect of lockdown policy on the COVID-19 incidence rate at the national level to inform policy response for this and future pandemics. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with a segmented regression model using publicly available data on daily reported new COVID-19 cases between 2 March 2020 and 1 September 2020. National-level data from Google Community Mobility Reports during this timeframe were also used in model development and robustness checks. Results showed an 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 6-9%] reduction in the change in incidence rate per day after Lockdown 1.0 compared to prior to the Lockdown order, with an additional reduction of 3% (95% CI = 2-3%) after Lockdown 4.0, suggesting an 11% (95% CI = 9-12%) reduction in the change in COVID-19 incidence after Lockdown 4.0 compared to the period before Lockdown 1.0. Uptake of the lockdown policy is indicated by decreased mobility and attenuation of the increasing incidence of COVID-19. The increasing rate of incident case reports in India was attenuated after the lockdown policy was implemented compared to before, and this reduction was maintained after the restrictions were eased, suggesting that the policy helped to 'flatten the curve' and buy additional time for pandemic preparedness, response and recovery.","output":"An interrupted time series analysis of the lockdown policies in India: a national-level analysis of COVID-19 incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infection due to SARS-CoV-2; this virus has been identified as the cause of the present pandemic. Several typical characteristics are present in this infection, in particular pneumonia with possible lung failure, but atypical clinical presentations are being described daily by physicians around the world. Ground-glass opacities with pneumonia are the most common and dangerous presentations of the COVID-19 disease, and they are usually associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to the general population, hospital workers have been at a greater risk of infection ever since the first patients were hospitalized. However, hospital workers have also been reported as having COVID-like symptoms despite repeated negative swab tests but having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with serological tests. We can postulate that a COVID-like syndrome is possible, in particular in hospital workers, that is characterized by symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs. These repeated negative NSPs make the difference in daily clinical management with people that experienced a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab; furthermore, a clear clinical differentiation of these situations is still lacking in the literature.

Meanwhile, it may also provide opportunities for positive outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic growth). Resilience and social support could serve as psychological resources to protect individuals against the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 crisis and enable people to develop positive changes during challenging times. Objective By testing the roles of resilience and social support in the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and negative mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety), as well as the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and positive mental health outcomes (post-traumatic growth, PTG), this study aimed to investigate the psychological mechanisms involved in different mental health outcomes induced by COVID-19. Methods An online survey was conducted 1 year after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak (from April to August 2021) in China. The survey includes demographic questionnaires and six scales: the Impact of Event Scale-Revised for COVID-19 (IES-RC), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). The structural equation model (SEM) was used to evaluate the relations and mechanisms between COVID-19 related stress and resilience, social support in depression, anxiety, and PTG. Results A total of 771 Chinese subjects completed the questionnaire, including 416 (54%) females. COVID-19 related stress was associated with anxiety (P < 0.001), PTG (P < 0.001), and depression (P < 0.001). Resilience was related to depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and PTG (P < 0.001). Social support was associated with depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and PTG (P < 0.001). Under SEM analysis, resilience mediated the effects of COVID-19 related stress on depression and post-traumatic growth. Social support mediated the impacts of COVID-19 related stress on post-traumatic growth, depression, and anxiety. The path coefficients of the mediation effects were statistically significant. Conclusions The current findings suggest that COVID-19 related stress has a double-edged effect on mental health. Depression, anxiety, and PTG coexist in Chinese individuals 1 year after the peak of the pandemic. Resilience and social support serve as important protective factors of mental health, safeguard people from the negative mental health outcomes of the COVID-19, and promote PTG.","output":"COVID-19 Related Stress and Mental Health Outcomes 1 Year After the Peak of the Pandemic Outbreak in China: the Mediating Effect of Resilience and Social Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a highly infectious RNA virus.

Experimental eviscerated thorax forces were assumed to have two distinct responses: an initial inertial response and subsequently, the main response. A second order mass-spring-damper model was used to characterize the initial inertial response of eviscerated thorax force using impactor kinematics. For the main response, equivalent strains in rib levels 4-7 were mapped at each time point and a strain-based summed force model was constructed using individual rib tests and the same ribs in the eviscerated thorax test. A piecewise approach was developed to join the two components of the curve and solve for mass, damping, stiffness parameters in the initial response, transition point, and scale factor of the strain-based summed force model. The final piecewise model was compared to the overall experimental eviscerated thorax forces for each PMHS (n=5) and resulted in R2 values of 0.87-0.96. A bootstrapping approach was utilized to validate the model. Final model predictions for the validation subjects were compared with the corridors constructed for the eviscerated thorax tests. BRSS values were approximately 0.71 indicating that this approach can predict eviscerated responses within one standard deviation from the mean response.

RESULTS: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Patients with systemic autoimmune or immune-mediated disease (AI/IMID) showed a significant increase, whereas patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. Patients with IA on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but not those on conventional-synthetic DMARDs, had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. CONCLUSION: Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of ageing, therapies and disease-specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyse the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.","output":"Prevalence of hospital PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in patients with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Often thought of as higher-order entities, events have recently become important subjects of research in the computational sciences, including within complex systems and natural language processing (NLP). One such application is event link prediction. Given an input event, event link prediction is the problem of retrieving a relevant set of events, similar to the problem of retrieving relevant documents on the Web in response to keyword queries. Since geopolitical events have complex semantics, it is an open question as to how to best model and represent events within the framework of event link prediction. In this paper, we formalize the problem and discuss how established representation learning algorithms from the machine learning community could potentially be applied to it. We then conduct a detailed empirical study on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) using a set of metrics inspired by the information retrieval community. Our results show that, while there is considerable signal in both network-theoretic and text-centric models of the problem, classic text-only models such as bag-of-words prove surprisingly difficult to outperform. Our results establish both a baseline for event link prediction on GTD, and currently outstanding challenges for the research community to tackle in this space.","output":"Link Prediction Between Structured Geopolitical Events: Models and Experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine decreases the risk of adverse outcome in patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at high risk of worsening. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: need for supplemental oxygen, age &#8805;75 years, age between 60 and 74 years and presence of at least one co-morbidity. Severely ill patients requiring oxygen therapy >3 L/min or intensive care were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death or start of invasive mechanical ventilation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary end points included mortality and clinical evolution at days 14 and 28, and viral shedding at days 5 and 10. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included because of a slowing down of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range 58-86 years) and 151/250 (60.4%) patients required oxygen therapy. The primary end point occurred in 9/124 (7.3%) patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8/123 (6.5%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.45-2.80). The rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests at days 5 and 10 were 72.8% (75/103) and 57.1% (52/91) in the hydroxychloroquine group, versus 73.0% (73/100) and 56.6% (47/83) in the placebo group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the other secondary end points.

However, the approval lag of vaccines in the Asia-Pacific region has not been assessed. The objective of this study is to assess the availability and approval lag of vaccines in Asia-Pacific countries and compare them among Asia-Pacific countries, the United States (US), and Europe (EU). Methods: The information on vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) between 2010 and 2019 was obtained primarily from the WHO website. The date of approval of the WHO prequalified vaccine in Australia, India, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, and EU was retrieved from the official website of national regulatory agencies. The vaccines were divided into two groups based on their first approval pathway, that is, vaccines that were first approved by SRA (Stringent Regulatory Authority including the US, EU, and WHO) and those that were first approved by non-SRA. The absolute approval lag represented the availability of the vaccine. Relative approval lag represented the lag time between the approval date of the country of interest and the first global approval date and was measured as the median approval lag. A MannCWhitney U test was used to examine statistical differences between relative approval lag between the SRA first and the non-SRA first groups. Results: A total of 92 vaccines were prequalified by the WHO between 2010 and 2019, but only 61 vaccines were included in the analysis. Over 50% of vaccines were first licensed by non-SRAs. Of all the WHO-prequalified vaccines, the median approval lag in the ASEAN countries in this study was longer than those in the US and EU, with a median of 30 months in Australia, 15 months in South Korea, 52 months in Thailand, and 23 months in Singapore, compared to 0 months in the US and EU. The differences in approval lags between SRA first vaccines and non-SRA first vaccines were statistically significant in South Korea and Thailand (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The approval lag of vaccines was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, indicating a gap between the Asia-pacific region and the US and EU in regard to access to new vaccines.

However, no data are available regarding the impact the pandemic may have on medical training in Mexico. The aim of our study was to evaluate and identify the medical school students perceptions of the changes in their clinical training due to the pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study where a previous validated online survey was translated and adapted by medical education experts and applied to senior medical students from March to April of 2021. The 16-item questionnaire was distributed online combining dichotomous, multiple-choice, and 5-point Likert response scale questions. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the students perceptions between public and private schools. RESULTS: A total of 671 responses were included in the study period. Most participants were from public schools (81%) and female (61%). Almost every respondent (94%) indicated it was necessary to obtain COVID-19 education, yet only half (54%) received such training. Students in private schools were less likely to have their clinical instruction canceled (53% vs. 77%, p = 0.001) and more likely to have access to virtual instruction (46% vs. 22%, p = 0.001) when compared to students from public schools. Four out of every five students considered their training inferior to that of previous generations, and most students (82%) would consider repeating their final year of clinical training. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 on medical education in Mexico has been significant. Most final-year medical students have been affected by the cancellation of their in-person clinical instruction, for which the majority would consider repeating their final year of training.

To date, there is no curative treatment for COVID-19, and with vaccines only recently being rolled out predominantly in wealthy countries, prevention still remains the main strategy. Social distancing has been proven to mitigate the epidemic and limit disease spread. As is the case in many other countries, the Ethiopian government has declared a state of emergency and taken several measures to impose social distancing. The level of compliance with social distancing measures in Ethiopia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the compliance, barriers, and facilitators to social distancing measures for the prevention of COVID-19 in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using telephone interview triangulated by a qualitative study was conducted over a period of one month from April 20th to May 20th, 2020 at the University of Gondar Hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 401 randomly selected participants, and 12 key representative informants selected by convenience were included for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Information on socio-demographic factors, knowledge about COVID-19, and practices concerning preventive measures--particularly social distancing--was collected. Respondents were asked what they thought were the barriers and facilitators of social distancing during in-depth face-to-face interviews. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data and Stata software, respectively. Frequencies and odds ratios were analyzed. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and a confidence level of 95% strength of association was used. Results: A total of 425 study subjects were approached and 401 responded positively (response rate of 94.4%). Of the 401 study participants, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2) reported poor compliance with social distancing measures. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years (SD  11.8).

Further, the authors aim to identify how physician participation in decision-making is impacted by organizational change and change-oriented leadership, as well as how it mediates the relationships between these two variables, performance obstacles and job satisfaction. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study adopted a cross-sectional survey design including data from Norwegian hospital physicians (N = 556). A hypothetical model was developed based on existing theory, confirmatory factor analysis was carried out in order to ensure the validity of measurement concepts, and the structural model was estimated using structural equation modelling. FINDINGS: The organizational changes in question were positively related to performance obstacles both directly and indirectly through participation in decision-making. Organizational change was also negatively related to job satisfaction, both directly and indirectly. Change-oriented leadership was negatively related to performance obstacles, but only indirectly through participation in decision-making, whereas it was positively related to job satisfaction both directly and indirectly.

However, the relationship between LUS and CXR is not clearly defined. The aim of our study was to describe the comparison between LUS interpretation and CXR readings in the first approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In the time of the first COVID-19 pandemic surge, we prospectively evaluated adult patients presenting to an emergency department complaining of symptoms raising suspicion of COVID-19. Patients were studied by LUS and only those performing also CXR were analyzed. All the patients performed viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LUS studies were classified in 4 categories of probabilities, based on the presence of typical or alternative signs of COVID-19-associated interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, the CXR readings were retrospectively adapted by 2 experts in 4 categories following the standard language that describes the computed tomography (CT) findings. Patients were divided in two groups, based on the agreement of the LUS and CXR categories. Results were also compared to RT-PCR and, when available, to CT studies. RESULTS: We analyzed 139 cases (55 women, mean age 59.1  15.5 years old). The LUS vs CXR results disagreed in 60 (43.2%) cases. RT-PCR was positive in 88 (63.3%) cases. In 45 cases, a CT scan was also performed and only 4 disagreed with LUS interpretation versus 24 in the comparison between CT and CXR. In 18 cases, LUS detected signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (high and intermediate probabilities) while CXR reading was negative; in 14 of these cases, a CT scan or a RT-PCR-positive result confirmed the LUS interpretation. In 6 cases, LUS detected signs of alternative diagnoses to COVID-19 pneumonia while CXR was negative; in 4 of these cases, CT scan confirmed atypical findings. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a strong disagreement between LUS interpretation and CXR reading in the early approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. Comparison with CT studies and RT-PCR results seems to confirm the superiority of LUS over a second retrospective reading of CXR.","output":"Descriptive analysis of a comparison between lung ultrasound and chest radiography in patients suspected of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sabah in Malaysian Borneo is among the Malaysian states which reported a high number of detected COVID-19 cases during the current pandemic.

The use of a dual oxygen concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED) of the Sabah Women and Children's Hospital. Due to conditions requiring isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully. This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing.

The study tools were adapted from WHO resources. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices. Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices. RESULTS: Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. 72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures. Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge.

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00-3.00) and 8.00 (11.00-5.00), respectively.

In this study, the positive rates of three dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment) and overall burnout were 9.09, 50.57, 56.59, and 73.98%, respectively. After the statistical analysis, we found that several factors can independently affect the dimensions. Working in the high infection region and negative coping styles can affect all three dimensions at once. More night shift quantity and having symptoms could increase emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while higher work intensity and senior title could increase emotional exhaustion and reduce personal accomplishment, respectively. Conclusion: The rate of moderate and severe burnout had increased due to the outbreak. More attention should be paid to burnout in HCPs, especially those with negative coping. There were some potential ways to reduce burnout, such as reducing their workload and providing better protection from the virus.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak Can Change the Job Burnout in Health Care Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus crisis reignited the debate over the ethical dimension of employment practices in the hotel sector. This study, which draws on the findings from semistructured interviews conducted with 51 Polish hotel workers during the pandemic, aims to ascertain their views on fairness in the workplace, their well-being, the attractiveness of hotel employment and collective representation. Our findings were, in many respects, at variance with earlier research and our a priori assumptions. Specifically, most interviewees had regular contracts, were satisfied with their jobs, rated the attractiveness of hotel employment highly and did not complain of emotional labour. Some highlighted managerial disrespectful treatment, especially after the outbreak of the pandemic. Most were indifferent to unions or viewed them unfavourably, doubted the efficacy of collective action and were uninterested in unionisation, with the crisis having little impact on their attitudes. The paper concludes by discussing theoretical and practical implications of the findings.","output":"Hotel employees' views on fairness, well-being and collective representation in times of the coronavirus crisis: Evidence from Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue and subcellular localization and its changes upon cell activation of virus-restricting APOBEC3 at protein levels are important to understanding physiological functions of this cytidine deaminase, but have not been thoroughly analyzed in vivo. To precisely follow the possible activation-induced changes in expression levels of APOBEC3 protein in different mouse tissues and cell populations, genome editing was utilized to establish knock-in mice that express APOBEC3 protein with an in-frame FLAG tag. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses were performed prior to and after an immunological stimulation. Cultured B cells expressed higher levels of APOBEC3 protein than T cells. All differentiation and activation stages of freshly prepared B cells expressed significant levels of APOBEC3 protein, but germinal center cells possessed the highest levels of APOBEC3 protein localized in their cytoplasm. Upon immunological stimulation with sheep red blood cells in vivo, germinal center cells with high levels of APOBEC3 protein expression increased in their number, but FLAG-specific fluorescence intensity in each cell did not change. T cells, even those in germinal centers, did not express significant levels of APOBEC3 protein. Thus, mouse APOBEC3 protein is expressed at distinctively high levels in germinal center B cells. Antigenic stimulation did not affect expression levels of cellular APOBEC3 protein despite increased numbers of germinal center cells.","output":"Distinctive High Expression of Antiretroviral APOBEC3 Protein in Mouse Germinal Center B Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants are a rich source of new antiviral, pharmacologically active agents. The naturally occurring plant alkaloid berberine (BBR) is one of the phytochemicals with a broad range of biological activity, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. BBR targets different steps in the viral life cycle and is thus a good candidate for use in novel antiviral drugs and therapies. It has been shown that BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase activity. It inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This isoquinoline alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMPK/mTOR, and NF-B signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR supports the host immune response, thus leading to viral clearance. In this short review, we focus on the most recent studies on the antiviral properties of berberine and its derivatives, which might be promising agents to be considered in future studies in the fight against the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","output":"Antiviral activity of berberine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a dynamic regulatory system that precisely modulates the functional organization of synapses. PTMs consist in target modifications by small chemical moieties or conjugation of lipids, sugars or polypeptides. Among them, ubiquitin and a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) share several features such as the structure of the small protein modifiers, the enzymatic cascades mediating the conjugation process and the targeted aminoacidic residue. In the brain, ubiquitination and two UBLs, namely sumoylation and the recently discovered neddylation orchestrate fundamental processes including synapse formation, maturation and plasticity, and their alteration is thought to contribute to the development of neurological disorders. Remarkably, emerging evidence suggests that these pathways tightly interplay to modulate the function of several proteins that possess pivotal roles for brain homeostasis as well as failure of this crosstalk seems to be implicated in the development of brain pathologies. In this review, we outline the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation and their functional interplay in synapse physiology and discuss their implication in the molecular pathogenesis of Intellectual Disability (ID), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is frequently co-morbid with a wide spectrum of brain pathologies. Finally, we propose a few outlooks that might contribute to better understand the complexity of these regulatory systems in regard to neuronal circuit pathophysiology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation are related PTMs modulating cellular and molecular pathways that are essential to generate fully functional neuronal circuits. Their impairment is indeed implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including ID. Growing evidence now indicates they also functionally cooperate to govern synapse development and function. The main goals of this review are (i) to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation in synapse functions; (ii) discuss how altered ubiquitination or sumoylation pathways may contribute to ID development; (iii) highlight evidence of a dynamic crosstalk between these PTMs, which represent a novel mechanism that could lead to the identification of new principles underlying synaptic function and dysfunction in ID.","output":"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins in the critical equilibrium between synapse physiology and intellectual disability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesWhile the development of vaccines against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) brought the hope of establishing herd immunity, which might help end the global pandemic, vaccine hesitancy can hinder the progress towards herd immunity. In this study, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of vaccine passports in relaxing public health restrictions. MethodsThrough an online survey that includes a conjoint experiment of a demographically representative sample of 5,000 Japanese adults aged 20-74, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of hypothetical vaccine passports. ResultsWe found that about 30% of respondents did not intend to vaccinate or have not yet decided, with major reasons for vaccine hesitancy being related to concerns about the safety and side effects of the vaccine. In line with previous findings, younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and psychological factors such as weaker COVID-19 fear were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The easing of public health restrictions such as travel, wearing face masks, and dining out at night was associated with an increase in vaccine acceptance by 4-10%. ConclusionVaccine hesitancy can be reduced by mitigating the concerns about vaccine safety and side effects, as well as by relaxing public health restrictions. However, the feasibility of vaccine passports needs to be sufficiently assessed, taking the ethical issues of passports and the public health impacts of the relaxation of restrictions into careful consideration.

There are few methods for the serological diagnosis of fungal diseases in animals. In this paper, an ELISA test for the diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis is proposed, which detects S. schenckii-specific antibodies in feline sera.

Information about disease severity can be obtained by investigating intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, especially when historical comparisons can be made with cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in 155 ICUs contributing to the GiViTI national database. To assess the impact on ICU workload, the occupancy rate during the epidemic phase was compared with influenza periods in previous years. A logistic regression model was developed to assess the prognostic importance of A(H1N1) influenza. RESULTS: The characteristics of the 319 A(H1N1) cases were similar to those reported in other studies, confirming the young age of patients (mean 43 years) and the higher prevalence among pregnant women and obese people. At the epidemics peak (OctoberCDecember 2009) the occupancy rate did not significantly differ from the same period of the previous year, and was significantly lower than the 2009 seasonal influenza outbreak (JanuaryCMarch 2009). Compared with CAP of other origin (3,678 patients), A(H1N1) pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of death. However, after adjusting for confounding this was no longer the case (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59C1.31; p = 0.52).

METHODS: In total, 814 patients in the training set were included to develop a novel scoring system; and 420 patients in the validation set were included to validate the model. RESULTS: A prediction score, called ACCCDL, was developed on the basis of six risk factors associated with COVID-19 progression: age, comorbidity, CD4(+) T cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For predicting COVID-19 progression, the ACCCDL score yielded a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) compared with the CALL score, CoLACD score, PH-COVID-19 score, neutrophilClymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyteCmonocyte ratio both in the training set (0.92, 0.84, 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.65, respectively) and in the validation set (0.97, 0.83, 0.83, 0.78, 0.74, and 0.60, respectively).

Deletions removing the entire gene or enhancers and point mutations in the coding region represent a well-established cause of haploinsufficiency. During diagnostic genetic testing on ISS/LWD patients, in addition to classic SHOX defects, five 5'UTR variants (c.-58G > T, c.-55C > T, c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del), were detected whose pathogenetic role was unclear and were thus classified as VUS (Variants of Uncertain Significance). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of these noncoding variations in SHOX haploinsufficiency. The variants were tested for their ability to interfere with correct gene expression of a regulated reporter gene (luciferase assay). The negative effect on the mRNA splicing predicted in silico for c.-19G > A was assayed in vitro through a minigene splicing assay. The luciferase assay showed that c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del significantly reduce luciferase activity by 60, 35, and 40% at the homozygous state. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA showed that c.-51G > A and c.-9del might interfere with the correct SHOX expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The exon trapping assay demonstrated that c.-19G > A determines the creation of a new branch site causing an aberrant mRNA splicing. In conclusion, this study allowed us to reclassify two of the 5'UTR variants identified during SHOX diagnostic screening as likely pathogenic, one remains as a VUS, and two as likely benign variants.

These models can help to control and prevent the outbreak of these infections. In this paper, we make long-term predictions based on the number of current confirmed cases, accumulative recovered cases, and dead cases of COVID-19 in some countries by the modeling approach. We use the SIRD (S: susceptible, I: infected, R: recovered, D: dead) epidemic model which is a nonautonomous dynamic system with incubation time delay to study the evolution of COVID-19 in some countries. From the analysis of the recent data, we find that the cure and death rates may not be constant and, in some countries, they are piecewise functions. They can be estimated from the delayed SIRD model by the finite difference method. According to the recent data and its subsequent cure and death rates, we can accurately estimate the parameters of the model and then predict the evolution of COVID-19 there. Through the predicted results, we can obtain the turning points, the plateau period, and the maximum number of COVID-19 cases. The predicted results suggest that the epidemic situation in some countries is very serious. It is advisable for the governments of these countries to take more stringent and scientific containment measures. Finally, we studied the impact of the infection rate  on COVID-19.

The ProPac-COVID trial evaluates whether combination therapy with macrolide azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy, and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalization duration and reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit, and death in patients with acute hospital admission and a positive test for 2019-nCoV and symptoms of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The ProPAC-COVID is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The primary outcome is number of days spent alive and out of hospital within 14 days from randomization. Randomization will be in blocks of unknown size, and the final allocation will be stratified for age, site of recruitment, and whether the patient has any chronic lung diseases. Data is analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, and main analyses will also be subject to modified ITT analysis and per protocol analysis. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the detailed statistical analysis plan for the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints of the ProPAC-COVID study. Enrolment of patients to the ProPAC-COVID study is still ongoing.

We aim to determine the differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices in various different cohorts and explore the pertinent factors that influenced behavior in tropical Singapore. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in the Singapore military from mid-August to early-October 2009, among 3054 personnel in four exposure groups - laboratory-confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, close contacts of cases, healthcare workers, and general personnel. RESULTS: 1063 (34.8%) participants responded. The mean age was 21.4 (SE 0.2) years old. Close contacts had the highest knowledge score (71.7%, p = 0.004) while cases had the highest practice scores (58.8%, p < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.27, p < 0.01) and knowledge and attitudes scores (r = 0.21, p < 0.01). The significant predictors of higher practice scores were higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001), Malay ethnicity (p < 0.001), exposure group (p < 0.05) and lower education level (p < 0.05). The significant predictors for higher attitudes scores were Malay ethnicity (p = 0.014) and higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001). The significant predictor for higher knowledge score was being a contact (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Knowledge is a significant influence on attitudes and practices in a pandemic, and personal experience influences practice behaviors.

We used nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2017C2018. Undernutrition was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of <18.5 kg/m(2). The concentration index (C) was used to measure the socioeconomic inequality in the prevalence of womens undernutrition. A multiple binary logistic regression model was carried out to find out the factors associated with womens undernutrition. The prevalence of undernutrition among women of 15C49 years was 12%. Among them, 8.5% of women were from urban and 12.7% of women were from rural areas. The prevalence of undernutrition was highest (21.9%) among women who belonged to the adolescent age group (15C19 years). The C showed that undernutrition was more prevalent among the socioeconomically worst-off (poorest) group in Bangladesh (C = ?0.26). An adjusted multiple logistic regression model indicated that women less than 19 years of age had higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 2.81; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.23, 3.55) of being undernourished. Women from the poorest wealth quintile (AOR: 3.93, 95% CI: 3.21, 4.81) had higher odds of being undernourished.

The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) regulation via the interferon- (IFN-)/janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway, and its prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A cohort of 181 patients were recruited to determine the association between PD-L1 expression and CRC prognosis; the patients were newly diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma and had also undergone a physical tumorectomy. Immunohistochemical staining and survival analysis were used to evaluate the predictive value of PD-L1 protein expression in CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis, RT-qPCR and western blotting, etc were performed to confirm that PD-L1 is regulated by the IFN-/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. PD-L1 up-regulation was more frequently observed in patients with larger tumors, positive vascular or lymphatic infiltration and a poorly differentiated stage in addition to being associated with a poor survival in patients with CRC. Following the stimulation with IFN-, PD-L1 expression levels were revealed to be increased via the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that the expression levels of PD-L1 may be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with CRC.

The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. RESULTS: In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the sensitivities of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively.

Treatment for CVT included systemic anticoagulation alone (n=27) or in conjunction with aspirin (n=24), cytoreductive therapy (n=14), or both (n=9). At a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range; 0.1-28.6), recurrent CVT was documented in 3 (4%) patients while recurrent arterial and venous thromboses and major hemorrhage were recorded in 11%, 9% and 14%, respectively. Follow-up neurological assessment revealed headaches (n=9), vision loss (n=1) and cognitive impairment (n=1). The current study lends clarity on MPN-associated CVT and highlights its close association with JAK2V617F, younger age, and female gender. Clinical features that distinguish COVID vaccine-related from MPN-CVT include lower likelihood of concurrent venous thromboses and intracerebral hemorrhage with the latter; as a result, MPN- CVT was not fatal.

METHOD: The TCMSP, TCMID and STITCH databases were used to screen the active ingredients and targets in the compound Xuanju capsule; the OMIM, TTD, PharmGKB and GeneCards databases were applied to screen the RA-related disease targets. Then, the obtained targets were imported into Cytoscape 3.7.1 software to construct the active ingredient-target network and the RA-related disease-target network. The active ingredient-target PPI network, the RA-related disease-target PPI network and the common target PPI network were built by using the STRING platform and Cytoscape 3.7.1 software. The GO and KEGG analyses of the common targets were analyzed by using the Metascape and Bioinformatics online tools. RESULTS: A total of 51 active ingredients and 513 corresponding ingredient targets were harvested from the compound Xuanju capsule; 641 RA-related disease targets were obtained. After two PPI networks were constructed and merged, 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules were identified and analyzed. 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules are mainly involved in the biological processes and molecular functions, such as the cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, the response to lipopolysaccharide and the blood vascular development, the cytokine activity, the cytokine receptor binding and the receptor regulator activity. Furthermore, 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules are concentrated in signaling pathways such as the IL-17, TNF, Th17 cell differentiation, Toll receptor and RA signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The compound Xuanju capsule had the action characteristics of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways in the treatment of RA, which might primarily reduce the release of proinflammatory factors (such as IL-6 and TNF-) and increase the production of anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-10) by regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways (such as IL-17), thereby alleviating the inflammatory damage and improving the bone tissue repair.","output":"Use of Network Pharmacology to Investigate the Mechanism of the Compound Xuanju Capsule in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Approximately 400 million individuals are infected with hookworms globally. Protective vaccines are needed to prevent reinfections, which often occur after drug treatment in endemic areas. Ideal vaccines are highly efficacious well tolerated, and do not present risks to patient safety. Peptide vaccines can generate specific, highly protective responses as they focus on minimal antigenic target(s) with a specific immuno-protective mechanism. Necator americanus aspartyl protease 1 (Na-APR-1) is one of the most promising hookworm vaccine antigens. The neutralizing epitope p3 (TSLIAGPKAQVEAIQKYIGAEL), together with universal T-helper epitope P25 (KLIPNASLIENCTKAEL), has been used previously to produce peptide vaccines and was found to protect BALB/c mice against rodent hookworm infections, resulting in worm burden reductions of up to 98%. However, due to extensive digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, large oral vaccination doses were necessary to achieve this level of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To overcome the limitations of oral vaccine delivery and to investigate protective efficacy and immune correlates of protection. Herein we examined five different peptide vaccines following intraperitoneal injection, to compare their efficacy with the clinical protein antigen APR-1. METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with p3-P25-based antigen that was adjuvanted with (1) lipid core peptide (LCP); (2) polymethyl methacrylate (PMA); (3) linear polyleucine (LL10); (4) branched polyleucine (BL10); or with (5) CpG/alum-adjuvanted control; and protein-based (6) CpG/alum-adjuvanted Na-APR-1. The mice sera, saliva, and feces were sampled for immune response evaluation. The mice sera, saliva, and feces were sampled for immune response evaluation. The immunized mice were further challenged via hookworm larvae infection and protection was evaluated by conducting intestinal hookworm counts. RESULTS: BL10 and LCP generated the highest serum anti-Na-APR-1 IgG and fecal anti-APR-1 IgG titers, but only BL10 generated significant fecal anti- Na-APR-1 IgA titers. Upon challenge, immunization with CpG/alum-adjuvanted p3-P25, BL10, and LCP provided the highest worm burden reductions of 75%, 77%, and 59%, respectively, while the group immunized with Na-APR-1 had only modest worm reduction of 26%. The relationships between serum anti-Na-APR-1 IgG, fecal anti-Na-APR-1 IgA and IgG, and worm burden reduction were established with R2 values  0.9, and the crucial role of both anti-Na-APR-1 IgG and IgA responses were identified. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated for the first time that p3-based vaccine candidates are safer and can deliver higher protection against hookworm infection compared to the clinical vaccine candidate, Na-APR-1.","output":"Development of a Peptide Vaccine against Hookworm Infection: Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and Immune Correlates of Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, breastfeeding in women positive for SARS-CoV-2 was compromised due to contradictory data regarding potential viral transmission. However, growing evidence confirms the relevant role of breast milk in providing passive immunity by generating and transmitting specific antibodies against the virus. Thus, our study aimed to develop and validate a specific protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk matrix as well as to determine the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on presence, concentration, and persistence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Study design/Methods: A prospective multicenter longitudinal study in Spain was carried out from April to December 2020. A total of 60 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or recovered from COVID-19 were included (n=52 PCR-diagnosed and n=8 seropositive). Data from maternal-infant clinical records and symptomatology were collected. A specific protocol was validated to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk, targeting the N1 region of the nucleocapsid gene and the envelope (E) gene. Presence and levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins (Igs) -IgA, IgG, and IgM- in breast milk samples from COVID-19 patients and from 13 women before the pandemic were also evaluated. Results: All breast milk samples showed negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence. We observed high intra- and inter-individual variability in the antibody response to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for each of the three isotypes IgA, IgM and IgG. Protease domain (MPro) antibodies were also detected in milk. In general, 82.9 % of the milk samples were positive for at least one of the three antibody isotypes, being 52.86 % of those positive for all three Igs. Positivity rate for IgA was relatively stable over time (65.2-87.5 %), whereas it raised continuously for IgG (47.8 % the first ten days to 87.5 % from day 41 up to day 206 post-PCR confirmation). Conclusions: Considering the lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk, our study confirms the safety of breastfeeding practices and highlights the relevance of virus-specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody transfer, that would provide passive immunity to breastfed infants and protect them against COVID-19 disease. This study provides crucial data to support official breastfeeding recommendations based on scientific evidence.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody detection in human milk from a prospective multicenter study in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Publisher regrets that this article is an accidental duplication of an article that has already been published in [Education for Chemical Engineers 34 (2021) 21C32], https://doi org/10 1016/j ece 2020 11 001 The duplicate article has therefore been withdrawn The full Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal can be found at https://www elsevier com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal ? 2021 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","output":"Erratum: Withdrawal notice to: Teaching Biotechnology students in Chemical Engineering in the time of COVID-19: assessment adaptation to digitalization [Education for Chemical Engineers 34 (2021) 94C105] (Education for Chemical Engineers (2021) 34 (94C105), (S1749772820300567), (10.1016/j.ece.2020.11.005))"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Regarding the high rate of obesity and overweight among women, develop a comprehensive and effective program it seems necessary to improve their nutritional behaviors and physical activity.

Nonetheless, during COVID-19 the initial rise and fall in the number of cases followed new waves of cases in many localities. In this paper, we explore a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model coupled with an individual be-havior response model that modulates the contact rate. A game with payoffs determined by the state of the disease captures the public's incentive to comply with the social distancing measures. We use replicator dynamics to model the response to changes in incentives. Using SEIR dynamics coupled with replicator dynamics, we identify a set of dynamics that can lead to growing oscillations in the number of cases until herd immunity is reached. According to the dynamics, an increase in the number of infected individuals changes the payoffs such that the public's cooperation level eventually increases. Increased cooperation levels is followed by a reduced number of cases in the community, which then reduces the public's incentive to cooperate. The decrease in the cooperation levels causes the number of cases to rise again. These waves correspond to cycles between cooperation and defection behavior, and the rise and fall of the number of the infected individuals. The proposed model also provides a proper tool to study the effects of the public health policies that aim to curb the growth in number of cases by providing incentives to cooperate. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Disease spread coupled with evolutionary social distancing dynamics can lead to growing oscillations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study focuses on the neuroprotective effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA, a major compound separated from Glycyrrhiza Radix, which is a crude Chinese traditional drug) against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. The results showed that GA treatment improved cell viability and ameliorated abnormal glutamate-induced alterations in mitochondria in DPC12 cells. GA reversed glutamate-suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2 levels, inhibited glutamate-enhanced expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, and reduced cytochrome C (Cyto C) release. Exposure to glutamate strongly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs); however, GA pretreatment enhanced activation of ERKs but not AKT. The presence of PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase [MEK] inhibitor) but not LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor) diminished the potency of GA for improving viability of glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells.

BACKGROUND The frequent occurrence of disasters has caused concern internationally. When disaster strikes, the demands on nursing staff are much higher than those on other healthcare professionals. There is little understanding of the concept of disaster among nurses in Hong Kong. DESIGN This was a descriptive study. A questionnaire was used to explore nurses' perception of disaster. METHOD The questionnaire was distributed to all registered nurses studying in a master's degree programme in a university in Hong Kong. FINDINGS Only 123 out of the 164 respondents (75%) gave a description of disaster in the open-ended question. Sixty-one per cent of them described unfortunate events with large numbers of victims as disasters. The 'Lan Kwai Fong tragedy--stampede caused by over-crowdedness' (90.9%) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (89.6%) were commonly referred to as disasters in Hong Kong. Fires in tall buildings (61.6%), infectious disease outbreaks (61%) and stampedes caused by overcrowding (48.8%) were rated as the events most likely to happen in Hong Kong.

Inpatient hypoglycemia may lead to increased risk for morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and readmission within 30 days of discharge, which in turn may lead to increased costs. Hospital-wide initiatives targeting hypoglycemia are known to be beneficial; however, their impact on patient care and economic measures in community nonteaching hospitals are unknown. METHODS This retrospective quality improvement study examined the effects of hospital-wide hypoglycemia initiatives on the rates of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a community hospital setting from January 1, 2016, until September 30, 2019. The potential cost of care savings has been calculated. RESULTS Among 49 315 total patient days, 2682 days had an instance of hypoglycemia (5.4%). Mean  SD hypoglycemic patient days/month was 59.6  16.0. The frequency of hypoglycemia significantly decreased from 7.5% in January 2016 to 3.9% in September 2019 (P = .001). Patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated a significant decrease in the frequency of hypoglycemia (7.4%-3.8%; P < .0001), while among patients with type 1 diabetes the frequency trended downwards but did not reach statistical significance (18.5%-18.0%; P = 0.08). Based on the reduction of hypoglycemia rates, the hospital had an estimated cost of care savings of $98 635 during the study period.

The highest case fatality rate/ratio was observed in Chad (7.60%) while the least value was observed in Seychelles (0.0%). France was the most common country involved in travel history of index cases. Sporadic transmission was recorded in 3 countries, 9 countries had cluster of cases while the rest had community transmission. The first WHO African region country to record COVID-19 case was Algeria, while Comoros was the last. Significant positive correlation was found between COVID-19 case number/deaths and Global Health Security Index. CONCLUSION: The WHO African region has had its own share of the pandemic with all the countries being affected. The trio of cluster cases, sporadic and community transmission were recorded with majority being community transmission.","output":"COVID-19 in WHO African Region: Account and Correlation of Epidemiological Indices with Some Selected Health-related Metrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quality measurement initiatives promote quality improvement in healthcare but can be challenging to implement effectively. This paper presents a Rapid Realist Review (RRR) of published literature on Quality Care-Process Metrics (QCP-M) implementation in nursing and midwifery practice. An RRR informed by RAMESES II standards was conducted as an efficient means to synthesize evidence using an expert panel. The review involved research question development, quality appraisal, data extraction, and evidence synthesis.

BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 outbreak and its subsequent repercussions and implications, after being declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), exposed all the inherent, lingering, and acute shortcomings of the health systems in many developing countries and Pakistan was no exception. METHODS: A detailed literature review was done which included peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 and health system, published in local and international journals, WHO and World Bank's publications, and the documents and official reports of the government. Focus was to glean and cite strategies adopted by the developing countries in response to COVID-19 and to see the applicability of those which are feasible for Pakistan. FINDINGS: Level of preparedness was minimal and the response to manage the outbreak was weak. Based on toll of the cases and number of deaths, this public health threat turned out to be a catastrophe beyond the controlling authority and capacity of the health system, and hence other sectors and agencies had to be engaged for devising a concerted and integrated response to deal with the emergency. Governance was disorderly, financing was inadequate, human resources were not trained, supplies and logistic were not stocked, information system was patchy, and research capacity was limited, and most of all the service delivery was in a biggest chaos of times. COVID-19 demanded to re-configure the health system of Pakistan. CONCLUSION: Improving the emergency preparedness of the hospitals is the foremost and an urgent need. A strong national public health system in Pakistan is needed to rapidly investigate and analyze the reports, assess the magnitude of the public health risk, share real-time information, and implement public health control measures in a concerted and systematic demeanor.","output":"Strengthening health system building blocks: configuring post-COVID-19 scenario in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orthopedic treatment is of particular difficulty in the complex therapy and rehabilitation of patients with precancerous diseases of the oral mucosa. In this regard, in patients with chronic inflammatory and destructive lesions of the oral mucosa, it is necessary to control changes in the oral cavity, taking into account clinical and laboratory data. Oral fluid is most often used as a diagnostic material in dental research, the composition and properties of which reflect functional changes in the body. However, the studies that substantiate rational orthopedic treatment in such patients are extremely insufficient: there are no data on the effect of orthopedic structures on the primary metabolism in the oral cavity in patients with precancerous diseases. In this regard, the purpose of this work was to study the biochemical parameters of the oral fluid in patients using orthopedic structures to identify the prognostic factors of precancerous conditions. In the oral fluid, the levels of total protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lactate were determined. Free radical oxidation was assessed by the intensity of induced biochemiluminescence and by the levels of lipid peroxidation products. In the oral fluid of patients with mucosal precancer compared with patients in the control group, a significantly higher intensity of free radical oxidation was revealed with a corresponding decrease in antioxidant activity. The level of the end products of lipid peroxidation - Schiff's bases - was statistically significantly increased. Among the metabolites of the oral fluid, there was a decrease in protein levels and an increase in cholesterol and lactate levels. At the same time, a positive correlation was established between the indicators of free radical oxidation and lactate, free radical oxidation and cholesterol, but negative with the levels of protein and triglycerides. Regarding the antioxidant system, there was a negative correlation between the tg (-2) value and the lactate level and positive with the triglyceride level, as well as a positive correlation between the Z parameter and the total protein level.

Transportation facilities using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) will support the COVID 19 vaccine;therefore, remote areas where accessibility is unavailable and takes enormous time to reach the primary health center. However, it can distribute vaccines at standard times with required temperature-sensitive. Moreover, eliminating human contact reduces logistics cost, time, and chances of virus carriers to the frontline workers while delivering vaccines. Methods: This feasibility study provides one of the possible ways of transporting vaccines using UAVs to the remote areas of Nepal;one approach will be using a customize prototype of drones and deploying it. The following will to studying the research articles on this field for proper guidance to conduct a study. The drone with a vaccine carrier takes the vaccine from Simikot Airport to the Local 18 Mission hospital about a 400-meter journey time of about 11-15 minutes. Results: The results show that drones can supply medical kits to health centers to reduce delivery time. It has been practicing that literature review on this related field states UAVs' possible implication in transporting vaccines. It reduces the time to deliver by 11-15 minutes with a vaccine carrier box (10-12 kg) that maintains a low temperature for 3-7 days. Furthermore, it minimizes the potential risk of not providing vaccines due to the unavailability of the road in remote areas. Conclusion: This alternative can support the delivery of vaccines for vulnerable groups deprived of health care. One of the significant ways to deliver the vaccine can be using a drone for remote areas with limited health facilities.

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was sent to all national representatives and members of the EUROMENE Core Group and Management Committee. Survey responses were collated and then summarized based on the numbers and percentages of respondents selecting each response option, while weighted average responses were calculated for questions with numerical value response options. Free text responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Overall there were 23 responses to the survey from participants across 19 different European countries, with a 95% country-level response rate. Serious concerns were expressed about GPs' knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS, and, it was felt, about 60% of patients with ME/CFS went undiagnosed as a result. The vast majority of GPs were perceived to lack confidence in either diagnosing or managing the condition. Disbelief, and misleading illness attributions, were perceived to be widespread, and the unavailability of specialist centres to which GPs could refer patients and seek advice and support was frequently commented upon. There was widespread support for more training on ME/CFS at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Conclusion: The results of this survey are consistent with the existing scientific literature. ME/CFS experts report that lack of knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS among GPs is a major cause of missed and delayed diagnoses, which renders problematic attempts to determine the incidence and prevalence of the disease, and to measure its economic impact.

In order to improve the effectiveness of incentive measures for worker safety behavior, this paper takes into account the multiple differences of individual workers fairness preference, risk preference and ability level, based on the tournament mechanism to construct a competition incentive model. By designing a tournament reward and salary distribution for heterogeneous workers, the occurrence of unsafe behaviors can be reduced. The study found that in terms of the optimal level of safety investment, workers with risk aversion attitude generally invest higher than that of workers with risk preference, no matter whether they have a strong fairness preference or not; In terms of the distribution of tournament rewards, workers with a risk aversion attitude and a higher level of fairness preference need to be given higher incentives.","output":"Research on the Tournament Incentive Mechanism of the Safety Behavior for Construction Workers: Considering Multiple Heterogeneity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background The human WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) has been recently described as a novel virus in respiratory tract samples.

In this study, we incorporate the following relevant and essential facts. If a seller allows a buyer to pay on credit, it increases sales volume. But if a seller asks a buyer for an advance payment, it decreases sales volume. Sometimes, a seller offers a buyer a price discount for an advance payment to increase sales and profitability. Asking a buyer for an advance payment bears interest earned and has no default risk. If a seller offers a buyer the opportunity to pay on credit, then a longer credit period may mean a higher the sales volume, but the default risk is higher, too. The seller wants to set an optimal selling price, replenishment time, and payment method simultaneously so that the profit per unit time is maximized. To achieve this, we develop and compare the sellers profit per unit time under each of three payment methodsadvance, cash and credit. Through numerical analyses, the following managerial insights are highlighted: (1) Under certain conditions, a specific payment type obtains the sellers highest profit among all three payment types. (2) If advance payment is required, then it is critically important for a seller to offer a price discount.

Methods: An analysis of electronic health records (EHR) was performed for a cohort of 13,638 patients, including COVID-19 positive and a comparison group of COVID-19 negative patients, who were followed for 12 months post COVID-19 episode at one health system. Both COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative patients were PCR validated. COVID-19 positive patients were classified as severe if they were hospitalized within the first 30 days of the date of their initial positive test. The 12-month risk of mortality was assessed in unadjusted Cox regressions and those adjusted for age, sex, race and comorbidities. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted for (a) patients aged 65 and older and (b) those <65 years. Results: Of the 13,638 patients included in this cohort, 178 had severe COVID-19, 246 had mild/moderate COVID-19, and 13,214 were COVID-19 negative. In the cohort, 2,686 died in the 12-month period. The 12-month adjusted all-cause mortality risk was significantly higher for patients with severe COVID-19 compared to both COVID-19 negative patients (HR 2.50; 95% CI 2.02, 3.09) and mild COVID-19 patients (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.28, 2.74). The vast majority of deaths (79.5%) were for causes other than respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. Among patients aged <65 years, the pattern was similar but the mortality risk for patients with severe COVID-19 was increased compared to both COVID-19 negative patients (HR 3.33; 95% CI 2.35, 4.73) and mild COVID-19 patients (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.59, 5.04).

METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective follow-up and report of COVID-19 cases in three different situations, pregnant women, hospitalized patients receiving medical attention in an Internal Medicine Service and ambulatory patients residing in Toluca City, and Mexico City. RESULTS: The experience with a first group of 20 women, pregnant (17) or in immediate puerperium (3) was successful in 18 cases with two unfortunate deaths. The five cases treated in an Internal Medicine service showed a positive outcome with two patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Of the remaining 16 patients treated in an ambulatory setting, all got cured.

Methionine- and choline-deficient diets (MCDD) induce fatty liver in mice which is partly mediated by triglyceride (TG) lipolysis in white adipose tissues (WATs). Because Fatp4 knockdown has been shown to increase adipocyte lipolysis in vitro, here, we determined the effects of MCDD on WAT lipolysis in aP2-Cre Fatp4-knockout (Fatp4A-/- ) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS Isolated WATs of Fatp4A-/- mice exposed to MCD medium showed an increase in lipolysis, and the strongest effect was noted on glycerol release from subcutaneous fat. Fatp4A-/- mice fed with MCDD for 4 weeks showed an increase in serum glycerol, TG, and leptin levels associated with the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase in subcutaneous fat. Chow-fed Fatp4A-/- mice also showed an increase in serum leptin and very-low-density lipoproteins as well as liver phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels. Both chow- and MCDD-fed Fatp4A-/- mice showed a decrease in serum ketone and WAT sphingomyelin levels which supported a metabolic shift to TG for subsequent WAT lipolysis.

Method Losartan inhibitory effect on deubiquitination and deISGylation properties of papain-like protease was investigated using a fluorescence method and gel shift analysis determining its inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect of Losartan on SARS-CoV-2 cell replication was investigated both when losartan was added to the cell culture 1 hour before (pre-infection group) and 1 hour after (post-infection group) SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. Results Losartan treatment of Vero E6 cells prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication by 80% and 70% respectively. Losartan was not a strong deubiquitinase and deISGylase inhibitor of PLpro. Conclusion Losartan added pre- and post-infection to the Vero E6 cell culture significantly prevents cell destruction and replication by SARS-CoV2. Losartan has low side-effects, is readily available, and can be produced at high levels globally, all features of a promising drug in treatment of COVID-19 if validated by clinical trials.","output":"Losartan promotes cell survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed considerable strain on hospital resources. We explored whether telemedicine (defined as a videoconference) might help. We undertook prospective structured phone interviews of urological patients (n = 399). We evaluated their suitability for telemedicine (judged by a panel of four physicians) and their risks from COVID-19 (10 factors for a poor outcome), and collected willingness for telemedicine and demographic data. Risk factors for an adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection were common (94.5% had one or more) and most patients (63.2%) were judged suitable for telemedicine. When asked, 84.7% of patients wished for a telemedical rather than a face-to-face consultation. Those favouring telemedicine were younger (68 [58C75] vs 76 [70C79.2] yr, p < 0.001). There was no difference in preference with oncological (mean 86%) or benign diagnoses (mean 85%), or with COVID-19 risks factors. In subgroup analysis, men with prostate cancer preferred telemedicine (odds ratio: 2.93 [1.07C8.03], p = 0.037). We concluded that many urological patients have risk factors for a poor outcome from COVID-19 and most preferred telemedicine consultations at this time.

Commercially available cerebral oximeters have not been evaluated independently. Unlike pulse oximeters, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration standards for performance or accuracy. We tested the hypothesis that cerebral oximeters accurately measure a fixed ratio of the oxygen saturation in cerebral mixed venous and arterial blood. METHODS We evaluated the performance of 5 commercially available cerebral oximeters: the EQUANOX? 7600 in 3- and 4-wavelength versions (Nonin Medical, Plymouth, MN), FORE-SIGHT? (Casmed, Branford, CT), INVOS? 5100C (Covidien, Boulder, CO), and the NIRO-200NX? (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) during stable isocapnic hypoxia in volunteers. Twenty-three healthy adults (14 men, 9 women) had sensors placed on each side of the forehead. The subject's inspired oxygen (FIO2) was then changed to produce 6 steady-state arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) levels between 100% and 70%, while end-tidal CO2 was maintained constant. At each plateau, simultaneous blood samples from the jugular bulb and radial artery were analyzed with a hemoximeter (OSM-3, Radiometer Medical A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Each cerebral oximeter's bias was calculated as the difference between the instrument's reading (cerebral saturation, ScO2) with the weighted saturation of venous and arterial blood (Sa/vO2), as specified by each manufacturer (INVOS: 25% arterial/75% venous; FORE-SIGHT, EQUANOX, and NIRO: 30% arterial/70% venous). RESULTS Five hundred forty-two comparisons between paired blood samples and oximeter readings were analyzed. The pooled root mean square error was 8.06%, a value higher than for pulse oximeters, which is 3% by Food and Drug Administration standards. The mean % bias  SD (precision) and root mean square errors were: FORE-SIGHT 1.76  3.92 and 4.28; INVOS 0.05  9.72 and 9.69; NIRO-200NX -1.13  9.64 and 9.68; EQUANOX-3  2.48  8.12 and 8.47; EQUANOX-4  2.84  6.27 and 6.86. The FORE-SIGHT, NIRO-200NX, and EQUANOX-3  had significantly more positive bias at lower SaO2. The amount of bias during hypoxia was reduced when the bias was calculated on the basis of difference between oximeter reading and the arterial and mixed venous saturation difference rather than the weighted average of blood saturation, indicating that differences in the ratio between arterial and venous blood volumes account for some of the positive bias at low saturation. Dark skin pigment tended to produce more negative bias in all instruments but bias was significantly larger than zero only for the FORE-SIGHT oximeter. Bias was significantly more negative in women for INVOS and EQUANOX devices but not for the FORE-SIGHT device. CONCLUSIONS While responsive to desaturation, cerebral oximeters exhibited large variation in reading errors between subjects, with mean bias possibly related to variations in the ratio of arterial and venous blood in the sampling area of the brain. This ratio is probably not fixed, as assumed by the manufacturers, but dynamically changes with hypoxia. Better understanding these factors could improve the performance of cerebral oximeters and help establish saturation or blood flow thresholds for brain well-being.","output":"Factors affecting the performance of 5 cerebral oximeters during hypoxia in healthy volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zhang et al.

We thus evaluate the effectiveness of the surgical mask, the N95 respirator mask, and its equivalent (KF94 mask) in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection were instructed to cough five times each while wearing (1) no mask, (2) surgical mask, (3) KF94 mask, and (4) N95 mask. The coughs were separated by 20-second intervals, and the patients were rested for at least 5 min between each setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in patient samples (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva), petri dishes placed in front of the patients during coughing, and swabs from the outer and inner surfaces of the masks were analysed with PCR. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection participated in the mask test. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the petri dishes after coughing in 3 out of 7 cases with the surgical mask or no mask. Viral particles were not found in the petri dishes after coughing while wearing the N95 mask or the KF94 mask. While viral particles were detected in both the inner and outer surfaces of the surgical masks, those were detected only in the inner surfaces of the N95 and K94 masks.

Training of healthcare providers to administer such contraceptives may improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review to collate the end-user uptake data following training of health care providers in low- and middle-income countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, the Global Health Library, and the Cochrane Library up to 23 May 2020. The review was restricted to low- and middle-income countries and focused on healthcare providers who had received training in LARC. Studies that reported contraceptive uptake among women, preference of LARC amongst health care workers and/or women, and unplanned pregnancies within 12 months of LARC initiation were included. All included studies underwent quality assessment using either the Cochrane's risk of bias tool or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020185291. RESULTS A total of 28 studies (end-users n= 6.112.544) were included (27 cohort studies and one randomised trial). 19 studies were set in Africa, 5 in Asia, one in Central America and 4 were multi-country studies. 28 studies reported LARC use among women, and 25 studies found an increase in uptake of LARC either by women using short acting methods switching to longer acting methods or by recruiting new users of LARC. The randomised controlled trial was assessed as high quality and reported positive findings, however there was great heterogeneity in the type of intervention and of how outcomes were measured amongst the other included studies. Further, the quality of these studies varied, although it should be noted that the poor quality studies reflected the trends of those of higher quality. CONCLUSIONS Despite heterogeneity, current evidence indicates that training of healthcare providers in LARC may increase the uptake amongst women in low- and middle-income countries.

While poorly defined, this hyperinflammatory response results in diffuse alveolar damage. The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm. Presentation of the hypothesis: A variety of human in vitro immune models indicate that LMWF5A reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures. Testing the hypothesis: A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Implications of hypothesis: If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit. Conclusions: In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.","output":"The novel immunomodulatory biologic LMWF5A for pharmacological attenuation of the \\"cytokine storm\\" in COVID-19 patients: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great toll on global health.

METHODS: We recruited twenty FHCW directly involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted for all participants, and qualitative analysis of data was done using Colaizzis phenomenological method. RESULTS: Five themes identified were: Early stage of the pandemic (fear, anxiety, public fright, other countries repatriating their citizens, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic and a call to duty for the FHCW); working with COVID-19 patients (excitement on patients recovery and duty stress); psychological, mental and emotional trauma; stigmatization (stigmatized by colleagues, family, friends or their residential communities, reasons for stigmatization which were fear of infection, limited knowledge of the virus and working at the isolation centre and the effect of stigma); and recommendations (education and awareness creation, government showing more care towards the FHCW and provision of health insurance for FHCW to take care of those that get infected in the line of duty). CONCLUSION: Stigmatization has proven to be a major challenge for FHCW in conducting their duties.

We evaluated the impact of NYC's vaccination campaign on saving lives as well as averting hospitalizations and cases. METHODS: We used an age-stratified agent-based model of COVID-19 to include transmission dynamics of Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Iota variants as identified in NYC. The model was calibrated and fitted to reported incidence in NYC, accounting for the relative transmissibility of each variant and vaccination rollout data. We simulated COVID-19 outbreak in NYC under the counterfactual scenario of no vaccination and compared the resulting disease burden with the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths reported under the actual pace of vaccination. FINDINGS: We found that without vaccination, there would have been a spring-wave of COVID-19 in NYC due to the spread of Alpha and Delta variants. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in NYC prevented such a wave, and averted 290,467 (95% CrI: 232,551  342,664) cases, 48,076 (95% CrI: 42,264  53,301) hospitalizations, and 8,508 (95% CrI: 7,374  9,543) deaths from December 14, 2020 to July 15, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates that the vaccination program in NYC was instrumental to substantially reducing the COVID-19 burden and suppressing a surge of cases attributable to more transmissible variants. As the Delta variant sweeps predominantly among unvaccinated individuals, our findings underscore the urgent need to accelerate vaccine uptake and close the vaccination coverage gaps.

Regarding screening for T2D, little has changed since The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and Diabetes Australia joint guidelines adopted the alternative HbA1c screening pathway in their 2016 edition (Table 1).1011 Most recently, a joint position statement was published by the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, the Australian Diabetes Society, the Dietitians Association of Australia, Exercise and Sports Science Australia and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.12 In contrast with the RACGP guidelines, which focus on screening and diagnosing T2D in asymptomatic people, the newer guidelines apply a lower threshold when using the Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool AUSDRISK13 to identify and screen for prediabetes that is defined by IFG, IGT and/or elevated HbA1c that are yet to meet the diagnostic criteria for T2D (Table 1). Both recommended FBG or HbA1c as a first-line investigation, with GTT being reserved for instances when the GTT results will influence the management of a borderline abnormal FBG result.1112 It should also be noted the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes remains contentious due to poor correlations between the three tests, poor reproducibility in adult and paediatric populations, and possibly different underlying pathophysiology.3 Consequently, the WHO, the American Diabetes Association, the RACGP, and the Australian joint position statement all use slightly different criteria for screening and diagnosing prediabetes.4'11'12 To further understand the extent to which changes to clinical practice guidelines and available pathology tests are being used in Australia to reduce progression along the T2D continuum, this study examined 10-year annual trends, from 2010-19, in the use of relevant MBS-funded T2D pathology testing by Australian doctors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for five days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5 days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the clinical improvement rate was higher in the study group [22/30 (73.3%)] compared to the control group [16/30 (53.3%)] ( p=0.10 ). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group ( p=0.37 ). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5% and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.3  85.7 and 220.8  127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively.

We present a new evidence for the mechanism of hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to microbial inflammation caused by pathogen-derived inducer, LPS. We demonstrate that hyperlipidemic animals succumbed to a non-lethal dose of LPS whereas normolipidemic controls survived. Strikingly, survival of hyperlipidemic animals was restored when the nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs), Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), and Carbohydrate-Responsive Element-Binding Proteins (ChREBPs) was impeded by targeting the nuclear transport checkpoint with cell-penetrating, biselective nuclear transport modifier (NTM) peptide. Furthermore, the burst of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, microvascular endothelial injury in the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys, and trafficking of inflammatory cells were also suppressed. To dissect the role of nuclear transport signaling pathways we designed and developed importin-selective NTM peptides. Selective targeting of the importin 5, ferrying SRTFs and ChREBPs, protected 70C100% hyperlipidemic animals.

Methods: This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of HCW, applied at Centro de Terapia Oncolgica (CTO), an Oncology clinic in Petrpolis, Brazil. Baseline screening for SARS-CoV-2 occurred between April 9 -29, 2020 using rapid IgM and IgG serological tests for all HCW. Follow-up serology testing took place once between November 5-December 28, 2020 and included retesting with indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG all HCW for seroconversion incidence. Reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was offered at baseline and follow-up for all symptomatic staff. The McNemar test was used to assess the change in positive serology incidence in both tests. Results: The study included 60 HCW, with 40 females (66.7%). Mean age was of 43.4 years old (SD =14.5). At baseline SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment, 57 (95%) were negative and 3 (5%) positive;59 (98%) asymptomatic HCW, and 1 symptomatic (1.6%) tested positive in RT-PCR. A total of 11 RT-PCR were performed since baseline until follow-up in symptomatic HCW, with 9 (81.8%) positive results, all of them with seroconversion. 6 (10%) asymptomatic HCW were seropositive at follow-up screening. None of baseline positive-serology asymptomatic HCW sustained their serology. Seroconversion occurred in 15 (25%) HCW - Table. The incidence of positive serologies in follow-up screening was statistically higher than at baseline (p = 0.008). [Formula presented] Conclusions: Most seroconversions were in symptomatic HCW, although the substantial number of positive serologies in asymptomatic HCW accent the importance and direct impact of regular universal testing. Seropositivity increased five-fold compared to baseline results. This detected increase in infections reflects a national pattern, suggesting community-based and not nosocomial transmission.

Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status.

The risk factors and mechanisms associated with PA are poorly understood. Although neurovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been documented, its association with PA has not yet been determined. METHODS: From a prospectively collected database of patients treated at a tertiary care center for pituitary adenoma, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of PA cases during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to December 2020. We also conducted a literature review to identify other reported cases. RESULTS: We identified 3 consecutive cases of PA and concomitant COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at presentation were headache and vision changes. The included patients were successfully treated with surgical decompression and medical management of the associated endocrinopathy, ultimately experiencing improvement in their visual symptoms at the latest follow-up examination. COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction test results in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the addition of our series to the literature, 10 cases of PA in the setting of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. The present series was limited in its ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between these 2 entities. However, COVID-19 infection might represent a risk factor for the development of PA.

Methods: Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, while the cell cycle, LC3 expression, apoptosis, change of mitochondrial potential, Bcl-2 protein expression level and the level of reactive oxygen species were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: As a result of physcion encumbrance, concentration-dependent inhibition of HeLa cell viability and the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle was observed. Activation of the lysosomal system was also revealed, which was expressed by an increased number of lysosomes, autophage vacuoles and increased expression of the LC3 protein, a marker of the autophagy process. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy showed that physcion induced clear changes in cervical cancer cells, especially in the structure of the nucleus and mitochondria, which correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species by the test compound and indicated the induction of the oxidative process. At the same time, the pro-apoptotic effect of physcion was demonstrated, and this mechanism was dependent on the activation of caspases 3/7 and the reduction in Bcl-2 protein expression.

Further, identifying whether the quantum of this dysfunction is associated with the severity of disease in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to to comprehensively explore the prevalence, nature and degree of endocrine dysfunction stratified based on disease severity at a dedicated COVID care centre. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients enrolled at PGIMER Chandigarh, were stratified on the basis of disease severity as: group I (moderate to severe disease including oxygen saturation <94% on room air or those with comorbidities) and group II (mild disease, with oxygen saturation >94% and without comorbidities). Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal, thyroid, gonadal axes and lactotroph function were evaluated. Inflammatory and cell-injury markers were also analysed. Results: Patients in group I had higher prevalence of hypocortisolism (38.5 vs 6.8%, p=0.012), lower ACTH (16.3 vs 32.1pg/ml, p=0.234) and DHEAS (86.29 vs 117.8g/dl, p= 0.086) as compared to group II. Low T3 syndrome was a universal finding, irrespective of disease severity. Sick euthyroid syndrome (apart from low T3 syndrome) (80.9 vs 73.1%, p= 0.046) and atypical thyroiditis (low T3, high T4, low or normal TSH) (14.3 vs 2.4%, p= 0.046) were more frequent in group I than group II. Male hypogonadism was also more prevalent in group I (75.6% vs 20.6%, p=0.006) than group II, with higher prevalence of both secondary (56.8 vs 15.3%, p=0.006) and primary (18.8 vs 5.3%, p=0.006) hypogonadism. Hyperprolactinemia was observed in 42.4% patients, without significant difference between both groups. Conclusion: COVID-19 can involve multiple endocrine organs and axes, with a greater prevalence and degree of endocrine dysfunction in those with more severe disease. Involvement of multiple axes, particularly at hypothalamo-pituitary level suggests the possibility of hypophysitis as an underlying etiology. We also observed less characterised findings like atypical thyroiditis and normal DHEAS despite secondary hypocortisolism. Follow-up surveillance of these patients at periodic intervals and estimation of anti-pituitary antibodies could be considered to elucidate viral cytopathic effect or inflammation as the major underlying mechanism of endocrine dysfunction.","output":"Endocrine Dysfunction in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins determinate the flower color of many plants.

We investigated the mechanism underlying flower coloration in tobacco by profiling flavonoid metabolites,expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes and their regulator genes in the pink-flowered tobacco cultivar Yunyan 87 and white-flowered Yunyan 87 mutant. RESULT: Significant down-accumulation of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanin, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside, cyanidin O-syringic acid, pelargonin, and pelargonidin 3-O-malonylhexoside (log2 fold change < - 10), endowed the flower color mutation in Yunyan 87 mutant. Transcriptome analysis showed that the coordinately down-regulated anthocyanin biosynthetic genes including chalcone isomerase, naringenin 3-dioxygenase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase played critical roles in suppressing the formation of the aforesaid anthocyanins. Several genes encoding MYB and bHLH transcription factors were also found down-regulated, and probably the reason for the suppression of structural genes.

METHODS: In a longitudinal single\\\\center study, we recruited 17 consecutive pediatric ALL patients. Serial blood samples were collected at diagnosis and weekly during the 4\\\\week induction phase of antileukemic chemotherapy. Healthy children (n = 14) and children with deep vein thrombosis (DVT; n = 7) or sepsis (n = 5) were recruited as negative and positive controls, respectively. In plasma, we measured endogenous thrombin generation potential (ETP) and components of extracellular traps, including cfDNA. RESULTS: In patients with ALL, ETP was increased at baseline and remained significantly elevated throughout the induction therapy. Plasma levels of cfDNA were increased at baseline and during the first 3 weeks of induction therapy. The extent of enhancement of ETP and plasma cfDNA in patients with ALL was similar to that seen in patients with DVT or sepsis. Treatment of plasma with DNase 1 lowered ETP in patients with ALL at each time point but did not affect ETP in healthy controls.

This in part relates to various state health authority or medical board restrictions with reductions in patient volume for evaluations, follow-ups, and procedures. Of course, the pandemic continues to persist which is in turn leading to longer-lasting effects. Our previous survey was performed in March 2020. At that time, there was a national lockdown in the United States with COVID-19 disease qualifying as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The pandemic caused by COVID-19 disease continues to have far-reaching implications on how we deliver routine care to patients and its effect on patient care, economic aspects, and health of interventional pain management providers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the current and expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventional pain management practices in a physician survey. The study was performed based on performance in 2021 compared to the 2019 pre-COVID era. METHODS: The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) administered a 16-question survey to their members by contacting them via a commercially available online marketing company platform. The survey was completed on www.constantcontact.com. RESULTS: The results showed that 88% of the providers experienced a reduction in income and a similar number expect decreases over the next 12 months. A large proportion of respondents (73.3%) reported a reduction in revenue of 11%-25%. In contrast, another 21.5% reported a revenue decline of 26%-50%, and 29% reported 11%-25% increase in expenses. Overall, new patient volume decreased 11%-25% based on the response from almost 63%, whereas almost 9% reported a decline of 26%-50%. In contrast, established patient volume declined 1%-10% as reported by 64% of the respondents, compared to an 11%-25% decrease by a small proportion of 14%. All interventional procedures showed significant decreases across the board, with 69% of the respondents reporting a decline in-office procedures, 64% in ambulatory surgery center (ASC) procedures, and 57% in hospital outpatient department (HOPD) procedures, ranging from 11%-25%. LIMITATIONS: The survey included a relatively small number of member physicians which could introduce sampling error. Consequently, it may not be generalizable for other specialties or even to pain medicine. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has put interventional pain practices throughout the United States under considerable financial and psychological stress. This study seeks to quantify the extent of economic loss and other challenges resultant from the pandemic. Almost 99% reported a decrease in revenues in the last 12 months, with 86% reporting an expected reduction in the next 12 months and 49% reporting an increase in expenses. Declines have been reported in all sectors with new patients, office procedures, ASC, and HOPD procedures, except for established patient visits, which have shown minor declines compared to other domains. Understanding the issues facing interventional pain management physicians facilitates the development of strategies to actively manage provider practice/well-being, and to minimize risk to personnel to keep patients safe.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Interventional Pain Management Practices is Significant and Long-Lasting: An Interventional Pain Management Physician Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air-transmitted pathogens may cause severe epidemics showing huge threats to public health.

This retrospective-study examined nutritional data of all inpatients aged 18C79 years, with a body-mass-index (BMI)  18.5 kg/m(2) admitted over a period of 4 years at two major hospitals in Australia. Patients were divided into 3 groups for comparison: normal/overweight (BMI 18.5C29.9 kg/m(2)), obese (BMI 30C39.9 kg/m(2)) and morbidly-obese (BMI  40 kg/m(2)). Outcome measures included length-of-hospital-stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and 30-day readmissions. Multilevel-mixed-effects regression was used to compare clinical outcomes between the groups after adjustment for potential confounders. Of 16,579 patients, 1004 (6.1%) were classified as morbidly-obese. Morbidly-obese patients had a significantly longer median (IQR) LOS than normal/overweight patients (5 (2, 12) vs. 5 (2, 11) days, p value = 0.012) and obese-patients (5 (2, 12) vs. 5 (2, 10) days, p value = 0.036). After adjusted-analysis, morbidly-obese patients had a higher incidence of a longer LOS than normal/overweight patients (IRR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02C1.07; p value < 0.001) and obese-patients (IRR 1.13; 95% CI 1.11C1.16; p value < 0.001).

In this study we derived a PK-PD model for propofol in adolescents undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery with an intraoperative wake-up test with reinduction of anesthesia using both Bispectral Index (BIS) and composite A-line ARX index (cAAI) as endpoints. METHODS Fourteen adolescents (9.8-20.1 years) were evaluated during standardized propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for idiopathic scoliosis surgery with an intraoperative wake-up test with reinduction of anesthesia. BIS and cAAI were continuously measured and blood samples collected. A propofol PKPD model was developed using NONMEM. RESULTS The time courses of propofol concentrations, BIS and cAAI values during anesthesia, intra-operative wakeup and reduction of anesthesia were best described by a two-compartment PK model linked to an inhibitory sigmoidal Emax PD model. For the sigmoidal Emax model, the propofol concentration at half maximum effect (EC50) was 3.51 and 2.14 mg/L and Hill coefficient 1.43 and 6.85 for BIS and cAAI, respectively. The delay in PD effect in relation to plasma concentration was best described by a two compartment effect-site model with a keo of 0.102 min- 1, ke12 of 0.121 min- 1 and ke21 of 0.172 min- 1. CONCLUSIONS A population PKPD model for propofol in adolescents was developed that successfully described the time course of propofol concentration, BIS and cAAI in individuals upon undergoing scoliosis surgery with intraoperative wake-up test and reinduction of anesthesia. Large differences were demonstrated between both monitors. This may imply that BIS and cAAI measure fundamentally different endpoints in the brain.","output":"Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of propofol in adolescents undergoing scoliosis surgery with intraoperative wake-up test: a study using Bispectral index and composite auditory evoked potentials as pharmacodynamic endpoints."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona pandemic 2019 (CoViD-19) has encouraged social movement for the physical distancing and awareness for the use of natural products of medicinal plants for home remedies Scientists are working to unravel the genetic makeup of corona virus i e , the causative agent of CoViD-19 in order to find treatments for the infection Until now, even medicine and vaccine have been formulated in order to help cure the disease The primary objective of this article is to identify and analyse the published articles in the areas of complementary herbal plant application for antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, ways to enhanced immunity, and to cure infectious symptoms One of the paramount options including the use of herb-based medicinal derivatives have been proposed to cure infections with the positive outcome Most of the established traditional medicinal systems like Traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda have recommended a list of several potent herbal and essential oils that ease the symptoms of infections by their regular massaging on the scalp These results can serve as a yard stick for the efficacious utilisation of food plants as home remedy and for the development of clinical study on disease prevention from natural resources in a global context","output":"Fighting against severe acute respiratory syndrome: A systematic review on plant foods and natural products as complementary herbal medicines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Namda or felt sheets and articles made of felt have a historic association with Tonk in Rajasthan (India). Felting has been practiced here for generations, providing a livelihood for the craftsmen who make hand-made felt and those who develop products from the felt sheets, including floor coverings, mats, and decorative pieces for both domestic and export markets. Felts design, finishing, and quality are the key criteria impacting the value of the urban product and the end market. The Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute (CSWRI) in Avikanagar conducted skill development training for rural women with a focus on making handicraft products from felt sheets. The objective was to promote traditional craft as well as empower women through enhancement of their self-reliance, with opportunities for further progression for high-performing trainees. The Indian Institute of Crafts & Design (IICD) in Jaipur collaborated with CSWRI for design intervention and skill enhancement targeting for the urban market. Just as these women were inching toward fully sustainable livelihoods, however, the sudden outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the demand and supply of handicraft products and seriously impacted their ability to work. This paper discusses the collaborative efforts put into building sustainable livelihoods around handicrafts and considers how the Covid-19 pandemic has impaired that work.

Location Northern Bohemia (Czech Republic, central Europe) in the Je?tdsky h?bet mountain range and its neighbourhood. Methods Three data sets were sampled: a floristic data set at the broad scale, another floristic data set at the intermediate scale, and a vegetation data set at the habitat scale. First, in each data set, species groups were produced by the COCKTAIL algorithm, which ensures maximized joint occurrence in the data set using a fidelity coefficient. Corresponding species groups were produced in the individual data sets by employing the same species for starting the algorithm. Second, the species groups formed in one data set, i.e. at a particular scale, were applied crosswise to the other data sets, i.e. to the other scales. Correspondence of a species group formed at a particular scale with a species group at another scale was determined. Third, to highlight the driving factors for the distribution of the plant species groups at each scale, canonical correspondence analysis was carried out. Results Twelve species groups were used to analyse the transferability of the groups across the three scales, but only six of them were found to be common to all scales. Correspondence of species groups derived from the finest scale with those derived at the broadest scale was, on average, higher than in the opposite direction. Forest (tree layer) cover, altitude and bedrock type explained most of the variability in canonical correspondence analysis across all scales. Main conclusions Transferability of species groups distinguished at a fine scale to broader scales is better than it is in the opposite direction.

Chicken embryo fibroblast DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 10. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of chMDA5 were performed by transfecting DF-1 cells with chMDA5-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chMDA5-expressing DNA. The transfected cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at an MOI of 10. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were collected at 2, 8, 16 and 24 hours postinfection (hpi) for IBDV titer determination and RNA extraction, respectively. IBDV RNA loads and mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, interferon- (IFN-) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), IFN-, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), myxovirus resistance gene (Mx), and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The IBDV titer increased up to 1.4  10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL at 24 hpi, and the IBDV RNA load reached 464 ng/L at 24 hpi. The mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-, PKR, OAS, Mx and MHC class I in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells exhibited significant (p < 0.05) upregulation up to 906-, 199-, 26,310-, 12-, 66,144-, 64,039- and 33-fold, respectively. Expressed chMDA5 from transfection and double-stranded RNA from IBDV infection were localized or colocalized in the cytoplasm of DF-1 cells at 16 hpi. When chMDA5 was knocked down in DF-1 cells, IBDV titers and RNA loads were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in DF-1 cells without chMDA5 knockdown at 24 hpi.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a bowel DGBI, is one of the most researched DGBI and has been the subject of copious epidemiological studies. Prevalence rates are based on diagnostic criteria. In the case of IBS, there are three central obstacles to attaining a clear picture of prevalence: the absence of biomarkers, the multitude of diagnostic criteria used over the years, and the heterogeneous nature of the methodology used in epidemiologic surveys. When the results of multiple studies, conducted over a long period of time, using different diagnostic criteria and different research methodology, and involving different study populations are pooled to determine a single summary prevalence rate it is difficult to interpret the results and to determine their reliability and significance. This pitfall is insufficiently recognised and unfortunate because prevalence rates are important for understanding the burden of disease, for allocating healthcare and research resources, and for incentivising and prioritising new treatments.

Examine age differences in SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from primary cases and infection risk among household contacts, and symptoms among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS. People with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nashville, Tennessee and central and western Wisconsin and their household contacts were followed daily for 14 days to ascertain symptoms and secondary transmission events. Households were enrolled between April 2020 and April 2021. Secondary infection risks (SIR) by age of the primary case and contacts were estimated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS. The 226 primary cases were followed by 198 (49%) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections among 404 household contacts. Age group-specific SIR among contacts ranged from 36% to 53%, with no differences by age. SIR was lower from primary cases aged 12C17 years than from primary cases 18C49 years (risk ratio [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19C0.91). SIR was 55% and 45%, respectively, among primary case-contact pairs in the same versus different age group (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.98C2.22).

Additionally, we aimed to explore staff experiences in LP services across Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (BSMHFT) in order to generate Trust recommendations promoting optimal healthcare provision amidst the on-going pandemic.MethodA mixed method service evaluation was conducted using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative methods involved reviewing referrals made to the QEHB LP service from March to June 2020, compared with the equivalent time period in 2019. Data were retrospectively extracted from the electronic clinical databases RIO and PICS, and subsequently analysed using Microsoft Office. The number of, and reasons for referrals to LP were identified, whilst focus groups were conducted to explore the subjective experiences of staff working across BSMHFT LP services.ResultBetween 1st March and 30th June 2020, 984 referrals were made to the QEHB LP service, compared to 1020 referrals in 2019, representing a 3.5% reduction. From 2019 to 2020, referrals due to psychotic symptoms and deliberate self-harm rose by 12.8% and 14.1% respectively, whilst referrals for drug and alcohol-related causes reduced by 28.3%. A significant increase (150%) in referrals for medication or management advice was seen. Focus groups indicated that staff perceived an initial reduction in number of referrals, but an increase in the acuity of patient presentations.Staff reported anxiety around contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2, exacerbated by uncertainty around patients COVID-19 status. In QEHB, sixty-five of the 984 referrals (7%) had a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR swab, with the remaining 919 referrals being either negative (68%) or unknown (25%). Ninety-six percent of consultations were conducted face-to-face in QEHB. There were conflicting views amongst staff regarding whether more consultations could have been conducted remotely. Furthermore, varying perceptions of support and communication from both the physical and mental health trust were reported.ConclusionQuantitative data indicates that COVID-19 impacted LP healthcare provision in BSMHFT.

This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes. OBJECTIVE Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. METHODS We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. RESULTS Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. CONCLUSIONS Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","output":"Understanding at-the-moment stress for parents during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the structure and operation of healthcare services worldwide.

This work analyzed 12,063 patients (56.8% men). The women in our study were older than the men, on average (67.9 vs. 65.7 years; p < 001). Bilateral condensation was more frequent among men than women (31.8% vs. 29.9%; p = 0.007). The men needed non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001, and 7.9% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). The most prevalent complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe cases in 19.9% of men (p < 0.001). In men, intensive care unit admission was more frequent (10% vs. 6.1%; p < 0.001) and the mortality rate was higher (23.1% vs. 18.9%; p < 0.001). Regarding mortality, the differences by gender were statistically significant in the age groups from 55 years to 89 years of age. A multivariate analysis showed that female sex was significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of mortality in our study. Male sex appears to be related to worse progress in COVID-19 patients and is an independent prognostic factor for mortality. In order to fully understand its prognostic impact, other factors associated with sex must be considered.","output":"Gender-Based Differences by Age Range in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Spanish Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic is pronounced in each healthcare process, including the management of breast cancer. The anxiety of COVID-19 changes patient preferences and some delay in routine controls and surgical managements occur. Some disintegration in medical care is to be expected during the pandemic, but the new coping strategies are needed in order to avoid delayed diagnosis of breast cancer. METHODS: A total number of 140 patients assigned for biopsy and diagnosed with breast cancer in our tertiary clinic between December 1st and August 31st were classified into 3 groups;A (December-February), B (March-May) and C (June-August) in order to compare the stage of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis before, during and after the peak period of pandemic. Clinical stage and age at presentation, family history of breast, ovarian and other types of cancer, BRCA (genetic testing), menopausal status, side of involvement (uni- or bilateral), histopathologic subtype, receptor positivity and molecular subtype were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Group A included 20 stage I (27.77 %), 32 stage II (44.44 %), 16 stage III (22.22 %) and 4 stage IV (5.55 %) breast cancer patients. Group B had 5 stage I (22.72 %), 8 stage II (36.36 %), 7 stage III (31.81 %) and 2 stage IV (9.09 %) breast cancer patients. Whereas in group C there were 4 stage I (8.69 %), 21 stage II (45.65 %), 16 stage III (34.78 %) and 5 stage IV (10.86 %) patients with breast cancer. The number of late-stage cancer patients in group C was significantly higher in comparison with the other groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: We speculate that the change in incidence of breast cancer by stage is attributable to a delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 related restrictions and presentation of new cases at more advanced stages once the restrictions were eased.

METHODS: A retrospective case series study of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Oman from 24 February to 23 July 2020. The data were obtained from the National surveillance COVID-19 network. RESULTS: The overall mean age of patients was 34 ( 14) years, 74% (n = 51,391) were males, 40,859 (59%) were Omani citizens, and 28,523 (41%) were foreign-born individuals. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever 50% (n = 34,600), cough 46% (n = 32,062), sore throat 46% (n = 31,953) and shortness of breath (SOB) 35% (n = 24,567). Overall, 8,960 (12.9%) patients required hospitalization with 1189 (13.3%) individuals requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation (MV). Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection were mostly Omani nationals and males between 30 and 39 years old (p < 0.001). The mortality rate was 7.7 per 100,000 population (n = 359) with rates of 9.4 (n = 278) and 4.8 (n = 81) deaths per 100,000 population in Omani nationals and foreign-born individuals, respectively.

Here, we aimed to determine the association between the ALB-dNLR score and post-PCI CAD patient outcomes. METHODS: A total of 6,050 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were enrolled between January 2008 and December 2016. These patients were divided into three groups according to their ALB-dNLR scores (0 points, n = 1,121; 1 point, n = 3,119; 2 points, n = 1,810). Mortality after PCI [all-cause (ACM) and cardiac (CM)] was taken as the primary endpoint. The prognostic value of the ALB-dNLR score was determined with the Cox proportional hazard model after adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: The ACM and CM rates differed among participants in the three groups (P = 0.007 and P = 0.034, respectively).

N?sohkamatowak emerged from a collaboration between the Kidney Health Community Program and First Nations and Mtis Health Services to find ways to deliver better care and education to First Nations and Mtis people living with kidney disease while acknowledging Truth and Reconciliation and the Calls to Action. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: This article describes how traditional Indigenous protocols and storytelling were woven into the N?sohkamatowak events, gathering of patient and family voices in writing and video format, and how this work led to a collaborative co-designed process that incorporates the Truth and Reconciliation: Calls to Action into kidney care and the benefits we have seen so far. The teachings of the 4 Rsrespect, reciprocity, responsibility, and relevance, were critical to ensuring that N?sohkamatowak reports and learning were shared with participants and the communities represented in this initiative. METHODS: Group discussions and sharing circles were facilitated in several locations throughout northern and central Saskatchewan. Main topics of discussion were traditional medicines, residential schools impact, community and peer supports for kidney disease patients, and cultural safety education for health care providers. KEY FINDINGS: The general themes selected for improvement were education, support within the local community, traditional practices and cultural competency, and delivery of services. To address these gaps in kidney care, the following objectives were co-created with First Nations and Mtis patients, families, and communities for Kidney Health to provide culturally appropriate education and resources, to ensure appropriate follow-up support to include strengthening connections to communities and other health authorities, to incorporate traditional practices into program design, and to ensure appropriate service delivery across the spectrum of care with a focus on screening and referral, which is strongly linked to coordination of care with local health centers. IMPLICATIONS: As a result of this work, the Kidney Health Community Program restructured the delivery of services and continues to work with N?sohkamatowak advisors on safety initiatives and chronic kidney disease awareness, prevention, and management in their respective communities. The Truth and Reconciliation and Calls to Action are honored to close the gaps in kidney care. LIMITATIONS: N?sohkamatowak is a local Kidney Health initiative that has the good fortune of having dedicated funding and staff to carry out this work.

The accuracy of QASs strongly depends on the management of such short text. This limitation motivates this paper, which studies the NED problem on KGs, involving only short texts.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction, patient and physician impression of encounter completeness, and reimbursement between in-person, video, and telephone encounters. This study also assessed factors influencing patient satisfaction, perception of completeness, and choice of future evaluation type. METHODS: This was a prospective study of all encounters at a health care-system owned practice. Encounter type, encounter modality, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reimbursement data, and physician assessment of encounter completeness were tracked. Patient satisfaction was assessed via standardized questions. RESULTS: There were 447 encounters, with 303 in-person (67.8%), 98 video (21.9%), and 46 telephone (10.3%). Patient satisfaction data was obtained from 251 patients. There was similar patient satisfaction among all encounter modalities. Both patients and physicians were more likely to deem an in-person encounter as complete. Physicians were more likely to report an in-person encounter to be complete for food allergy (P < .001) and chronic rhinitis (P = .001) compared with video or telephone, whereas patients reported in-person encounters for food allergy to be complete compared with other modalities (P = .002). Patients reported that future encounter types should depend on the clinical situation. CONCLUSIONS: There was similar patient satisfaction with in-person, video, and telephone encounters in an allergy/immunology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Internal purchasing, formulary, and drug shortage data were reviewed to identify drugs subject to a high shortage risk (\\"shortage drugs\\") or not subject to a high shortage risk (\\"nonshortage drugs\\"). Potential candidate predictors of drug shortage risk were collected from previous literature. The dataset was trained and tested using 2 methods, including k-fold cross-validation and a 70/30 partition into a training dataset and a testing dataset, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 shortage and nonshortage drugs were included.

The Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanoparticles are about 37-53 nm in size, and the cores of the nanostructures are composed of Au nanoparticles with sizes of ~11 nm. The effect of shell thickness on the thermoelectric properties of core-shell nanocomposites is investigated after sintering the core-shell nanoparticles into pellets using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The power factor was optimized by synergetic effect of the improvement of Seebeck coefficient by energy filtering in the Au/Cu2Se interface and the effective tuning of carrier concentration by Ohmic contact in the interface. The lattice thermal conductivity of core-shell nanocomposites is reduced by coherent phonon scattering, which is caused by the wave-like interference of phonons due to the phase shift in the core-shell interface. The highest ZT value of 0.61 is obtained at 723 K for Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanocomposites with a shell thickness of 21 nm, which is higher than that of pure Cu2Se nanocomposite or a mixture of Au and Cu2Se particles.","output":"Size Controlled Au-Cu2Se Core-Shell Nanoparticles and Their Thermoelectric Properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and on disease modifying therapies (DMTs) that can be immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory form a special group where risk of continuation of DMT needs to be taken into account with risk of contracting Covid-19. This concept can pose a degree of anxiety for patients as well as neurologists. We aimed to evaluate patient perspectives regarding the use of Natalizumab and anti-CD20 therapies (Rituximab and Ocrelizumab) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: cross-sectional study conducted via voluntary survey filled in by patients with MS and related disorders receiving their infusional treatment in one MS centre in Australia, exploring their concerns regarding their therapy, their therapy and COVID-19, precautions undertaken in response to the pandemic, and factors impacting their decision-making. Results: 170 patients completed the survey. Of patients on Natalizumab, the majority had either no or mild concern regarding their DMT and COVID-19, and of patients on B-cell depleting therapies, again, the majority had no or mild concern, though a slightly higher proportion had a moderate level of concern. Asked to delineate their concerns, an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 was more commonly conveyed than MS-specific factors or poor outcomes pertaining to COVID-19 if contracted, by patients in both groups. Conversely, being invited to specifically consider the possibility of contracting COVID-19 or experience a relapse of MS, almost half of the cohort rated both of equal of concern. More than half of the cohort were self-isolating more stringently than general government advice and government-related resources followed by information provided by patient's neurologist where the commonest means of information to guide decision making. Conclusions: Whilst a large proportion of patients had some concern regarding the impact of their DMT on COVID-19, whether on their risk of contracting COVID-19 or a theoretical risk for more severe disease, the overall level of concern in most cases was at most mild. Patients on B-cell depleting therapies were more inclined to express a higher level of concern. A similar concern was ascribed to a risk of a relapse or worsening MS symptoms compared to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Such attitudes may underscore a willingness of patients to continue their DMT where benefits outweigh risks during future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Evaluating the perspective of patients with MS and related conditions on their DMT in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in one MS centre in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given that New York State's (NYS) was the first epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US), we were interested in potential racial/ethnic differences in pregnancy-related experiences among women pregnant during versus prior to the pandemic. We surveyed 1,525 women (18-44 years) proportionate to geographic and sociodemographic distribution between June 9, 20 and July 21, 20. We carried out bivariate analysis of various social and pregnancy-related factors by racial/ethnic identity (White, Black, Hispanic) and binary logistic and linear regression assessing the association between race/ethnicity, pregnancy prior to/during the pandemic, demographic characteristics, health and social wellbeing, and employment as an essential worker with pregnancy-related healthcare delays and changes. Overall, Black and Hispanic women were significantly more likely to experience a host of negative prenatal and postpartum experiences. In general, multivariate analyses revealed that individuals who were pregnant during the pandemic, lived in NYC, participated in social welfare programs, lacked health insurance, and/or were essential workers were more likely to report delays in prenatal and postpartum care and/or more changes/negative experiences. In light of previous evidence of racial disparities in birth experiences, the higher rates of negative pregnancy/birth-care and postpartum/newborn-care experiences among Black and Hispanic women in bivariate analysis warrant further inspection given that their aggregation for multivariate analysis may have obscured differences at the level of individual events.

The clinical characteristics of 1238 consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. Patients with respiratory distress were recorded as severe cases, while others were recorded as mild-moderate cases. Patients with  2 upper limit of normal of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin were defined as patients with liver injury, while others were recorded as patients without liver injury. RESULTS: The severe group included 460 patients (37.2%) while the mild-moderate group included 778 patients (62.8%). Fever, white blood cell (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the severe group (p < 0.05).

The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality. This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries. Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome. During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic. Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative. China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic. Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients. Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data. Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients. In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means.

Health systems, patients, and healthcare providers may benefit from knowledge regarding which factors predict length of stay (LOS), and therefore healthcare resource allocation, in patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: 559 patients were retrospectively identified who were admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA between February and May of 2020. All patients tested positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and received computed tomography screening for viral pneumonia. We collected data present at time of hospital admission and performed a retrospective analysis to determine factors associated with hospital LOS. Results: Mean hospital LOS for our cohort was 9.0 days. In this cohort, most patients received antibiotics. 100% of patients received glucocorticoids and 8.1% received remdesivir. 31.2% participated in clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies. 26.8% of patients required intensive care during their hospitalization, 17.4% required invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 11.1% died. On multivariable linear regression analysis, increasing leukocyte count and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus predicted decreased LOS. Increased respiratory support within the first 24 hours, patient age, creatinine, and total bilirubin were associated with increased LOS.

However, the mental health impacts for residents already living with mental illness remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined change in mental health symptom burden for this group and potential associations with clinical and contextual factors. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients of a specialist aged mental health clinical service for RAC. Change in symptoms (measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version [NPI\\\\NH]) between pre\\\\pandemic and two pandemic timepoints were analysed using Wilcoxon signed\\\\rank tests. Potential associations with baseline diagnosis or severity of lockdown restrictions in RAC were assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: Data from 91 patient files were included. The median NPI\\\\NH score slightly increased during wave one (baseline median NPI\\\\NH score = 17.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 10.0C27.0]; wave one median = 19.0, IQR: 8.0C30.0) and fell during wave two (Median: 15.5, IQR: 7.0C28.0), but changes were not statistically significant (all p\\\\values >0.05).

Forty-one interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate between April and May 2021. RESULTS: 37 units (90.2%) responded to the survey. The majority (64.9%) have a fully dedicated space with a weekly presence of 3 chest physicians (82.1%) and support of an anesthesiologist on specific days (48.6%). There is marked heterogeneity in the IP unit's equipment, and 56.8% acquired disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Pre-bronchoscopy hemogram, platelet count and coagulation tests are regularly asked by more than 90% of the units, even when deep sedation or biopsies are not planned. In 97.3% of cases, topical anesthesia and midazolam are utilized. Propofol (21.6%) and fentanyl (29.7%) are occasionally employed in some institutions. Most units use ancillary sampling techniques to diagnose central or peripheral lesions, with radial EBUS being used for guidance of distal procedures in 37.8% of centers, linear EBUS and EUS-B-FNA for mediastinal diagnosis and/or staging in 45.9% and 27.0% of units, respectively. Cryobiopsies are used by 21.6% of respondents to diagnose diffuse lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in 37.8% of centers.

We assess feasibility and outcomes for ACTIVE. METHODS: Mixed methods comprised a randomised feasibility trial with qualitative process evaluation and a nested fatigue risk substudy. Participants at a higher risk of fatigue were allocated 2:1 to behavioural intervention or information alone. Participants at a lower risk of fatigue entered the fatigue risk substudy. Feasibility was assessed by rates of eligibility, recruitment, retention and adherence. Qualitative interviews explored acceptability of the intervention and trial processes. Measures of fatigue, anxiety, depression, quality of life and self-efficacy were self-reported before, during and 10 days, 3 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy. Pre-treatment fatigue risk score and post-treatment fatigue were correlated. RESULTS: Fifty percent (n = 75) of eligible patients were recruited with 33 higher risk participants randomised to the trial and 42 entering the fatigue risk score substudy. Trial design and methods were feasible and acceptable with 91% of participants completing all measures according to protocol. Fatigue was clinically-significantly lower in the intervention group during, and in the weeks after, treatment compared to the control: all secondary measures favoured the intervention group. Positive group differences were not maintained at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Our targeted approach to fatigue self-management is feasible and acceptable within the early breast cancer pathway.

As the innate immune response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5, ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection, HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are likely active in bat cells. IMPORTANCE Bats are the reservoir host for many highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a reservoir for so many viruses.","output":"Transcriptome Profiling of the Virus-Induced Innate Immune Response in Pteropus vampyrus and Its Attenuation by Nipah Virus Interferon Antagonist Functions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus has infected over 65 million people worldwide and caused over one and half million deaths. Definitive diagnosis and treatment require laboratory confirmation, which is generally based upon Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests carried out in a high-complexity laboratory. The Abbott ID NOW platform provides fast results but has been criticized for low sensitivity. Objective: To determine the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by ID NOW in an ambulatory population presenting for initial diagnostic testing. Design: Consecutive patients presenting at the Febrile Upper Respiratory Infection clinics and other clinics at The Everett Clinic between April 8th and 22nd, 2020 provided two nasal swab samples, which were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the ID NOW platform and an RT-PCR platform. Patients were excluded if they were unable to demonstrate an understanding of the study, unwilling to commit to having all samples collected, had a history of nosebleed in the past 24 hours, nasal surgery in the past two weeks, chemotherapy treatment with documented low platelet and low white blood cell counts, or acute facial trauma. The sensitivity for each platform was compared with a composite reference standard based upon all tests. In addition, a systematic review (subset of review CRD420202044410 registered on PROSPERO) was conducted using papers identified by searching PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv for investigations in which at least 20 subjects were simultaneously tested using ID NOW and RT-PCR, and which appeared between January 1, 2020 and August 16, 2020. Bias was assessed using the QUADAS2 instrument. Meta-analysis was conducted in which the results of this evaluation were combined with those of results from the systematic review to estimate the performance of ID NOW by comparison with RT-PCR. Results: The study enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, 21 of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by both the ID NOW and RT-PCR assays, and 2 of whom tested positive only with the RT-PCR assay. In addition, the study enrolled 189 asymptomatic patients, none of whom tested positive by either ID NOW or RT-PCR. An invalid ID NOW assay result was reported for 9 subjects (2 asymptomatic, 7 symptomatic), all of whom tested negative by RT-PCR. Thus, the positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the RT-PCR assay was 91.3%, and the negative percent agreement was 100%. The meta-analysis, which included the results of this evaluation together with results from our systematic review, allows us to estimate the sensitivity of the ID NOW assay to be 84% (95% CI 55-96%), and identifies patients with viral loads most likely to be associated with transmissible infections. Discussion: This clinical study and meta-analysis show that although the ID NOW platform is not as sensitive as RT-PCR for identification of SARS-CoV-2, it nevertheless provides a high positive and negative predictive value in many populations. Conclusions are limited by the relatively small sizes of many of the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, together with the heterogeneity of populations enrolled and nucleic acid amplification tests utilized for comparison.","output":"Relative Sensitivity of ID NOW and RT-PCR for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an Ambulatory Population: Clinical Evaluation, Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of a new vaccine usually consists of a linear sequence of several steps and lasts many years [ ]","output":"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Vaccines: The Promises and the Challenges Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leukemoid reaction is a rare clinical condition defined by marked leukocytosis with predominantly mature neutrophils It is an uncommon condition with reported incidence of less than 1% in hospitalized patients The major causes of leukemoid reaction are severe infection (clostridium difficile colitis, tuberculosis, or severe shigellosis), malignancies, intoxication, and severe hemorrhage This article presents a case report of a 64-year-old female with severe COVID-19 infection who presented with marked leukocytosis After extensive workup to exclude hematologic malignancy, the patient was diagnosed to have a leukemoid reaction","output":"Leukemoid Reaction in a Patient With Severe COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]they are the faster innate interceptors The issue also includes a manuscript regarding predictions of hyper-thermic cell death by adopting a three-state mathematical model coupled with a tumor growth model [12] Last but not least, a methodology paper on the use Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to carefully study the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) combined to gold NPs has been included [13]","output":"Immune Responses to Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What expectations should professionals and the public place on visuals to communicate the uncertainties of complex phenomena?

We describe the clinical features, demography, treatment trends, baseline laboratory parameters of a cohort of patients admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their association with the outcome. MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical, laboratory and treatment patterns of consecutive patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay and death. FindingsA total of 2080 patients were included in the study. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Amongst the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5-11) days. Out of 853 (42.3%%) of patients who had COVID-19 Acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation, 340 (39.9%) died. Patients aged 45-60 years [OR (95% CI): 1.8 (1.2-2.6)p =0.003] and those aged >60 years [OR (95%CI): 3.4 (2.3-5.2), p<0.001] had a higher odds of death as compared to the 18-44 age group. Vaccination reduced the odds of death by 30% [OR (95% CI): 0.7 (0.5-0.9), p=0.036]. Patients with hyper inflammation at baseline as suggested by leucocytosis [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.4-3.10), p <0.001], raised d-dimer >500 mg/dL [OR (95% CI): 3.2 (2.2-4.6), p <0.001] and raised C-reactive peptide >0.5 mg/L [OR (95% CI): 3.8 (1.1-13), p=0.037] had higher odds of death. Patients who were admitted in the second week had lower odds of death and those admitted in the third week had higher odds of death. InterpretationThis is the largest cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 from India reported to date and has shown that vaccination status and early admission during the inflammatory phase can change the course of illness of these patients. Strategies should be made to improve vaccination rates and early admission of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to improve outcomes. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic has been ravaging the world since December 2019 and the cases in various regions are being reported in waves. We found that the case fatality rates ranging from 1.4% to 28.3% have been reported in the first wave in India. Older age and the presence of comorbidities are known predictors of mortality. There are no reports regarding the effectiveness of vaccination, correlation of mortality with the timing of admission to the health care facility and inflammatory markers in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Added-value of this studyThis study reports the real-world situation where patients get admitted at varying time points of their illness due to the mismatch between the availability of hospital beds and the rising number of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. It reports the odds of developing severe hypoxia necessitating oxygen therapy and death thus helping identify priority groups for admission. Implications of all the available evidenceThis study found increased odds of requiring oxygen support or death in patients older than 45 years of age, with comorbidities, and those who had hyper-inflammation with raised C-reactive peptide, d-dimer or leukocytosis. Patients who were admitted in the second week of illness had lower odds of death as compared to those admitted in the third week implying that treatment with corticosteroids in the second week of the illness during the inflammatory phase could lead to reduced mortality. These findings would help triage patients and provide guidance for developing admission policy during times where hospital beds are scarce. Vaccination was found to reduce the odds of deterioration or death and should be fast-tracked to prevent further waves of the pandemic.","output":"Clinical features, demography and predictors of outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary care hospital in India-A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate messages about infant feeding on breastmilk substitute (BMS) manufacturer websites directed at US caregivers and compare information and portrayals of breast-feeding/breastmilk with that of infant formula (IF) feeding. DESIGN We conducted a content analysis of US BMS companies' websites. A codebook was created through an iterative process to identify messages and images about breast-feeding/breastmilk and IF feeding, including benefits or issues associated with each, and direct-to-consumer marketing practices that could discourage breast-feeding. SETTING Data were collected in 2019-2020 and analysed in 2020-2021 for US websites of five IF manufacturers. PARTICIPANTS The websites of Similac, Enfamil and Gerber, which collectively represent approximately 98 % of the US IF market, and two US organic brands, Earth's Best and Happy Baby. RESULTS Websites contained more messages about breast-feeding/breastmilk than IF but were significantly more likely to mention benefits to baby of IF (44 %) than breast-feeding/breastmilk (<26 %), including significantly more statements that IF provides brain, neural and gastrointestinal benefits; 40 % of breast-feeding/breastmilk content was dedicated to breast-feeding problems (e.g. sore nipples). Twice as many screenshots compared IF brands favourably to breastmilk than as superior to other brands. Certain companies displayed images indicating ease of IF feeding and difficulty of breast-feeding. CONCLUSIONS Substantial messaging on BMS manufacturer websites encouraged IF feeding and discouraged breast-feeding. Health professionals should discourage their patients from visiting these websites and the US government should regulate misleading claims. Companies should refrain from providing breast-feeding advice and align their US marketing with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.","output":"Breastmilk or infant formula?

Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. Population Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Cognitive COVID is an informal term coined to interchangeably refer to acute changes in cognition during COVID-19 and/or cognitive sequelae with various deficits following the infection. These may manifest as altered levels of consciousness, encephalopathy-like symptoms, delirium, and loss of various memory domains. Dysexecutive syndrome is a peculiar manifestation of Cognitive COVID as well. In the previous major outbreaks of viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza. There have been attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms describing the causality of similar symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review, therefore, is attempting to highlight the current understanding of the various direct and indirect mechanisms, focusing on the role of neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the general pro-inflammatory state, and the pandemic-associated psychosocial stressors in the causality of Cognitive COVID. Neurotropism is associated with various mechanisms including retrograde neuronal transmission via olfactory pathway, a general hematogenous spread, and the virus using immune cells as vectors. The high amounts of inflammation caused by COVID-19, compounded with potential intubation, are associated with a deleterious effect on the cognition as well. Finally, the pandemics unique psychosocial impact has raised alarm due to its possible effect on cognition. Furthermore, with surfacing reports of post-COVID-vaccination cognitive impairments after vaccines containing mRNA encoding for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize their causality and ways to mitigate the risk. The potential impact on the quality of life of an individual and the fact that even a minor proportion of COVID-19 cases developing cognitive impairment could be a significant burden on already overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world make it vital to gather further evidence regarding the prevalence, presentation, correlations, and causality of these events and reevaluate our approach to accommodate early identification, management, and rehabilitation of patients exhibiting cognitive symptoms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and the Brain: What Do We Know about the Causality of Cognitive COVID?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is aimed at researching possible changes in the tourism sector after the end of the pandemic caused by coronavirus It is noted that even today the countries have begun to take important steps to overcome the emerging problems The restrictive measures, which have been imposed almost all over the world, and especially the closure of interstate borders, have caused significant damage to the tourism industry During this period, some airlines were on the verge of bankruptcy, millions of people lost their jobs or had to stop working Hotels, restaurants, travel companies, shops need immediate government support, due to the financial consequences of the crisis The budgets of the EU Member States suffered billions in losses The Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament has proposed to prepare a special plan to help the tourism business in the near future Health, safety and protection of guests, employees and business partners should be the most important priorities in each country, regardless of the extent of the damage caused by coronavirus The need to introduce special certificates, which will ensure that the institutions that received them, fully comply with the highest standards of safety, hygiene, cleanliness, and in the case of coronavirus detection, the guest will be provided with all necessary medical care After the stabilization of the situation due to the pandemic, people will continue to travel Places with a safer epidemiological situation will be a priority In addition, most tourists will seek to make their holiday as cheap as possible, choosing more budget holiday destinations, accommodation and transportation It is also important that travel companies and related industries take all necessary measures to protect travelers during the entire tour The stabilization of the tourism sector is directly related to the recovery of the entire economy of the country","output":"Tourism during a pandemic: implications and prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pandemics including COVID-19 have disproportionately affected socioeconomically vulnerable populations Objective: Our objective was to create a repeatable modeling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability Methods: Using readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable data sets, we used stepwise linear regression techniques to build predictive models during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in high population density states The mean sample size was 43 and ranged from 8 (Connecticut) to 82 (Michigan) Results: The New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania models provided the strongest predictions of top counties in densely populated states with a high likelihood of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates For all of these models, P values were less than 05 Conclusions: The models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states with strong model predictions as input into a much needed pandemic playbook for local health care agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources We have also confirmed the utility of our models with pharmaceutical companies for use in decisions pertaining to vaccine trial and distribution locations","output":"Predicting Health Disparities in Regions at Risk of Severe Illness to Inform Health Care Resource Allocation During Pandemics: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared oropharyngeal swab test performance with nasopharyngeal testing for discontinuation of transmission-based COVID-19 precautions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by either quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs or presence of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and who underwent chest radiograph or CT or both were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Three pediatric radiologists independently reviewed radiographs and CTs to identify the presence, localization, distribution and extension of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: We included 140 children (71 female; median age 6.3 years, interquartile range 1.6-12.1 years) in the study. Peribronchial thickening (93%), ground-glass opacities (79%) and vascular engorgement (63%) were the most frequent findings on 131 radiographs. Ground-glass opacities (91%), vascular engorgement (84%) and peribronchial thickening (72%) were the most frequent findings on 32 CTs. Peribronchial thickening (100%), ground-glass opacities (83%) and pulmonary vascular engorgement (79%) were common radiograph findings in asymptomatic children (n=25). Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were significantly higher in children who needed intensive care admission or died (92% and 48%), in contrast with children with a favorable outcome (71% and 24%, respectively; P<0.05).

In a rural area of South Africa with an annual incidence (2011-2015) of 5 and 7% per annum for 15-19 and 20-24-year olds respectively, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could provide AGYW with a form of HIV prevention they can more easily control. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we describe findings from a study conducted in 2017 that assessed knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP to better understand community readiness for an AGYW PrEP rollout. METHODS We used descriptive analysis of a quantitative demographic survey (n = 8,414 ages 15-86) to identify population awareness and early PrEP adopters. We also conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 52 potential PrEP gatekeepers (health care workers, community leaders) to assess their potential influence in an AGYW PrEP rollout and describe the current sexual health landscape. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and iteratively coded to identify major themes. RESULTS PrEP knowledge in the general population, measured through a demographic survey, was low (n = 125/8,414, 1.49% had heard of the drug). Medicalized delivery pathways created hostility to AGYW PrEP use. Key informants had higher levels of knowledge about PrEP and saw it as a needed intervention. Community norms around adolescent sexuality, which painted sexually active youth as irresponsible and disengaged from their own health, made many ambivalent towards a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Health care workers discussed ways to shame AGYW if they tried to access PrEP as they feared the drug would encourage promiscuity and \\"risky\\" behaviour. Others interviewed opposed provision on the basis of health care equity and feared PrEP would divert both drug and human resources from treatment programs. CONCLUSIONS The health system in this poor, high-HIV incidence area had multiple barriers to a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Norms around adolescent sexuality and gatekeeper concerns that PrEP could divert health resources from treatment to prevention could create barriers to PrEP roll-out in this setting. Alternate modes of delivery, particularly those which are youth-led and demedicalize PrEP, must be explored.","output":"\\"They have this not care - don't care attitude:\\" A Mixed Methods Study Evaluating Community Readiness for Oral PrEP in Adolescent Girls and Young Women in a Rural Area of South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aims to assess rates of antibiotic prescriptions and its determinants in in children with COVID-19 or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C).

By harnessing an evolutionary conserved endogenous biological pathway, first identified in plants and lower organisms, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) reagents are used to bind to and promote the degradation of target RNAs, resulting in knockdown of the expression of specific genes. RNAi can be induced in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 21C23 base pairs (bp) in length or by plasmid and viral vector systems that express double-stranded short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that are subsequently processed to siRNAs by the cellular machinery. RNAi has been widely used in mammalian cells to define the functional roles of individual genes, particularly in disease. In addition, siRNA and shRNA libraries have been developed to allow the systematic analysis of genes required for disease processes such as cancer using high throughput RNAi screens. RNAi has been used for the knockdown of gene expression in experimental animals, with the development of shRNA systems that allow tissue-specific and inducible knockdown of genes promising to provide a quicker and cheaper way to generate transgenic animals than conventional approaches. Finally, because of the ability of RNAi to silence disease-associated genes in tissue culture and animal models, the development of RNAi-based reagents for clinical applications is gathering pace, as technological enhancements that improve siRNA stability and delivery in vivo, while minimising off-target and nonspecific effects, are developed.","output":"RNA interference: From gene silencing to gene-specific therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is an important cause of stroke and vascular dementia. Most cases are multifactorial, but an emerging minority have a monogenic cause. While NOTCH3 is the best-known gene, several others have been reported. We aimed to summarise the cerebral phenotypes associated with these more recent cSVD genes. Methods: We performed a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020196720), searching Medline/Embase (conception to July 2020) for any language publications describing COL4A1/2, TREX1, HTRA1, ADA2, or CTSA pathogenic variant carriers. We extracted data about individuals characteristics, clinical and vascular radiological cerebral phenotypes. We summarised phenotype frequencies per gene, comparing patterns across genes. Results: We screened 6,485 publications including 402, and extracted data on 390 COL4A1, 123 TREX1, 44 HTRA1 homozygous, 41 COL4A2, 346 ADA2, 82 HTRA1 heterozygous, and 14 CTSA individuals. Mean age ranged from 15 (ADA2) to 59 years (HTRA1 heterozygotes). Clinical phenotype frequencies varied widely: stroke 9% (TREX1) to 52% (HTRA1 heterozygotes), cognitive features 0% (ADA2) to 64% (HTRA1 homozygotes), psychiatric features 0% (COL4A2; ADA2) to 57% (CTSA). Among individuals with neuroimaging, vascular radiological phenotypes appeared common, ranging from 62% (ADA2) to 100% (HTRA1 homozygotes; CTSA). White matter lesions were the most common pathology, except in ADA2 and COL4A2 cases, where ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions dominated, respectively. Conclusions: There appear to be differences in cerebral manifestations across cSVD genes.

Given the emerging role of the IgA isotype in the COVID-19 diagnostics, we aimed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies in a COVID-19 population seronegative for IgM. A total of 30 patients hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) for COVID-19, seronegative for IgM antibodies, have been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They all had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction result. Assays used were a chemiluminescent assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG (S + N) and an ELISA, measuring specific IgG (S1) and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 patients, eight were positive for IgA, seven were positive for IgG (N + S), and two for IgG (S1), at the first point (5-7 days from the onset of symptoms). The IgA antibodies mean values at the second (9-13 days) and third (21-25 days) time points were even more than twice as high as IgG assays. The agreement between the two IgG assays was moderate (Cohen's K = 0.59; SE = 0.13). The inclusion of the IgA antibodies determination among serological tests of the COVID-19 diagnostic is recommended. IgA antibodies may help to close the serological gap of the COVID-19.

Data from our CF center have shown an association between low HGS and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) in cwCF. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves physical strength. Therefore, we devised a project to assess implementing a HIIT exercise program in the home setting, in order to improve physical strength in cwCF with HGS  50th percentile. Patients were instructed to complete 3C5 sessions of HIIT exercises per week. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were used to compare HGS, FEV(1), and body mass index (BMI) percentile at baseline and at a follow-up clinic visit. Follow-up was limited due to the COVID pandemic. Adherence to the HIIT regimen was poor. A total of twenty-nine cwCF participated in the program. However, a total of 13 individuals reported some form of moderate activity at follow-up and therefore constituted our final study population.

Prospective studies on LUS for the assessment of pneumonia in adult patients were extensively carried out for more than 10 years before this era. None of these prospective studies attempted to differentiate bacterial and viral pneumonia in adult patients using LUS. The majority of studies considered the LUS examination to be positive if sonographic consolidations or multiple B-lines were observed. Significant differences existed in the accuracy of these studies. Some studies revealed that LUS showed superior sensitivity to chest X-ray. These results indicate that point-of-care LUS has the potential to be an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The LUS diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units is more challenging in comparison with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in emergency departments due to the limited access to the mechanically ventilated patients and the high prevalence of atelectasis. However, several studies have demonstrated that the combination of LUS findings with other clinical markers improved the diagnostic accuracy. In the COVID-19 era, many case reports and small observational studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have been published in a short period.

A novel disease of relatively unknown origin, COVID-19 does not seem to be amenable to the currently available medicines since there is no specific cure for the disease. In the absence of any vaccine or effective antiviral medication, we have no tools at our disposal, but the method of quarantine, be it domestic or institutional, to hinder any further progression of this outbreak. However, there is a record of physicians in the past who practiced convalescent blood transfusion. To their awe, the method seemed to be useful.

This study aims at comparing the ILI incidence of 2019-2020 influenza season with the incidence of COVID-19 cases in order to better understand the current epidemic and to evaluate whether the implementation of ILI surveillance system could succeed in early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The distribution of ILI cases in the seasons 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 was taken in consideration and the curve trends were compared and analyzed according to geographical areas, age groups and time differences. RESULTS: The curve trends presented a similar pattern up to the 9th week; in fact, a reduction in the ILI incidence rate was observed in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 season but in the 2019-2020 an increase in the reported ILI emerged. The relation between the numbers reported by 2019-2020 ILI surveillance and those reported for COVID-19 is supported by the curve trends, the correspondence between age groups, the correspondence by geographical location, and also by the results of the nasopharyngeal swab tests performed.

This has given rise to a number of health and mental disorders. Mental wellness is one of the most neglected, however crucial, aspects of today's fast-paced world. Mental health issues can, both directly and indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an individual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the stress and finding the stress trend for an individual that may lead to serious mental ailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can be achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various factors) arising from a person's behavioral patterns. Specific techniques are identified in the literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based methods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks. In this work, a multimodal AI-based framework is proposed to monitor a person's working behavior and stress levels. We propose a methodology for efficiently detecting stress due to workload by concatenating heterogeneous raw sensor data streams (e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, and computer interaction). This data can be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized unique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy for fusion to detect stress and its level and, secondly, identifying a stress pattern over a period of time. We were able to achieve 96.09% accuracy on the test set in stress detection and classification. Further, we were able to reduce the stress scale prediction model loss to 0.036 using these modalities.

Here we used a unique translational model of lethal H5N1 influenza in cynomolgus macaques that utilizes inhalation of small-particle virus aerosols to define mechanisms driving lethal disease. RNA sequencing of lung tissue revealed an intense interferon response within two days of infection that resulted in widespread expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Macaques with lethal disease had rapid and profound loss of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and infiltration of activated CCR2(+) CX3CR1(+) interstitial macrophages (IMs) and neutrophils into lungs. Parallel changes of AMs and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) correlated with virus load when compared to macaques with mild influenza. Both AMs and IMs in lethal influenza were M1-type inflammatory macrophages which expressed neutrophil chemotactic factors, while neutrophils expressed genes associated with activation and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs were prominent in lung and were found in alveolar spaces as well as lung parenchyma. Genes associated with pyroptosis but not apoptosis were increased in lung, and activated inflammatory caspases, IL-1 and cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD) were present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung homogenates. Cleaved GSDMD was expressed by lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells which were present in large numbers in alveolar spaces, consistent with loss of epithelial integrity. Cleaved GSDMD colocalized with viral NP-expressing cells in alveoli, reflecting pyroptosis of infected cells. These novel findings reveal that a potent interferon and inflammatory cascade in lung associated with infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils, elaboration of NETs and cell death by pyroptosis mediates lethal H5N1 influenza in nonhuman primates, and by extension humans.

severe patients (P&lt;0 001) The counts of T+B+NK, CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells were significantly decreased with the increase of illness severity (P&lt;0 001) while the CD4/CD8 ratio in the critical group was significantly higher than that of the mild and severe groups (mild vs critical, P=0 002;severe vs critical, P=0 030) Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that T+B+NK and CD3 showed the highest area under ROC for the identification of critical cases Then the mild and severe cases were combined into one group and compared with the critical group Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-to-CD3, neutrophil-to-CD4 and neutrophil-to-CD8 were used to assess illness severity, and our data showed that NLR was the best marker The lymphocytes

Less well understood are the implications of these contractions for child acute malnutrition (wasting), a major risk factor for under-5 mortality. This study explores the nutritional impacts of economic growth shocks over 1990C2018 by linking wasting outcomes collected for 1.256 million children from 52 countries to lagged annual changes in economic growth. Estimates suggest that a 10% annual decline in national income increases moderate/severe wasting prevalence by 14.4C17.8%. An exploration of possible mechanisms suggests negative economic shocks may increase risks of inadequate dietary diversity among children.

Research is limited on how to support preference communication while using existing preference assessment tools (e.g., the Minimum Data Set 3.0). METHODS This study examined the effect of two assessment conditions (standard verbal; visual-and-text supported;) on residents' (N = 21) social and leisure preference consistency over 1-week and utterance types (acknowledgment, elaboration, off-topic, request for clarification) in response to preference questions. Residents with severe dementia were recruited from four nursing homes (n = 11) and three assisted living facilities (n = 10). As a preliminary measure of provider acceptability and social validity, a sample of 10 na?ve judges (University students) listened to the interviews and rated residents' communication clarity and their confidence with understanding residents' preferences. RESULTS Neither assessment condition promoted significantly greater levels of consistency (i.e., the same preference rating at Time 1 and Time 2). Residents expressed significantly fewer requests for clarification in the visual-and-text supported condition. Na?ve judges rated residents' communication positively, with no significant differences between conditions.

Point-of-care tests (POCTs) may offer a potential solution to improve clinical outcomes for children by reducing diagnostic uncertainty in acute illness, and streamlining management of chronic diseases. However, their clinical impact in paediatric ambulatory care is unknown. We aimed to describe the clinical impact of all in-vitro diagnostic POCTs on patient outcomes and healthcare processes in paediatric ambulatory care. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science from inception to 29 January 2020 without language restrictions. We included studies of children presenting to ambulatory care settings (general practice, hospital outpatient clinics, or emergency departments, walk-in centres, registered drug shops delivering healthcare) where in-vitro diagnostic POCTs were compared to usual care. We included all quantitative clinical outcome data across all conditions or infection syndromes reporting on the impact of POCTs on clinical care and healthcare processes. Where feasible, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by performing meta-analysis using random effects models. RESULTS We included 35 studies. Data relating to at least one outcome were available for 89,439 children of whom 45,283 had a POCT across six conditions or infection syndromes: malaria (n = 14); non-specific acute fever 'illness' (n = 7); sore throat (n = 5); acute respiratory tract infections (n = 5); HIV (n = 3); and diabetes (n = 1). Outcomes centred around decision-making such as prescription of medications or hospital referral. Pooled estimates showed that malarial-POCTs (Plasmodium falciparum) better targeted antimalarial treatment by reducing over-treatment by a third compared to usual care (RR 0.67; 95% CI [0.58 to 0.77], n = 36,949). HIV-POCTs improved initiating earlier antiretroviral therapy compared to usual care (RR, 3.11; 95% CI [1.55 to 6.25], n = 912). Across the other four conditions, there was limited evidence for the benefit of POCTs in paediatric ambulatory care except for acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where POCT C-Reactive Protein (CRP) may reduce immediate antibiotic prescribing by a third (risk difference, -0.29 [-0.47, -0.11], n = 2,747). This difference was shown in randomised controlled trials in LMICs which included guidance on interpretation of POCT-CRP, specific training or employed a diagnostic algorithm prior to POC testing. CONCLUSION Overall, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of POCTs in paediatric ambulatory care. POCTs help to target prescribing for children with malaria and HIV. There is emerging evidence that POCT-CRP may better target antibiotic prescribing for children with acute RTIs in LMIC, but not in high-income countries. Research is urgently needed to understand where POCTs are likely to improve clinical outcomes in paediatric settings worldwide.","output":"In-vitro diagnostic point-of-care tests in paediatric ambulatory care: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China with subsequent human to human transmission worldwide had taken up the shape of a devastating pandemic.

In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups.

The AAHKS Board of Directors quickly initiated an online lecture series named the Fellows Online COVID-19 AAHKS Learning (FOCAL) initiative. The purpose of this study was to illustrate the impact that this educational platform had on residents and adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows. METHODS: Between March 31(st) and June 25(th), 2020 an online educational platform was simultaneously developed and delivered. Adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows and residents were invited to participate in the free, live, online education sessions. Faculty from well-respected institutions from around the United States volunteered their time to host the initiative, choosing topics to present, ranging from hip (13 lectures) and knee (9 lectures), to practice management/miscellaneous (12 lectures). Attendee registrations were tracked via the online platform and the maximum number of attendees per session was recorded. A survey was administered to attendees for feedback. RESULTS: Thirty-four one-hour virtual lectures were delivered in real-time by 79 different faculty members from 20 different institutions. A total of 4746 registrations for the 34 lectures were received, with 2768 registrants (58.3%) attending. The average attendance was 81 viewers per session (range: 21-143), with attendance peaking mid-April 2020. A survey administered to lecture participants showed that 104/109 (95.4%) attended live lectures and 93/109 (85.3%) watched recorded sessions. 92.5% of attendees responded that they wanted the lectures to continue after clinical responsibilities resumed. CONCLUSION: Amid a pandemic with cessation of in-person training, AAHKS delivered a robust virtual training alternative, exposing residents and fellows to a variety of renowned faculty and topics. Attendance with the program were very high, along with continued interest to continue this initiative. These worldwide lectures may lead to future opportunities in virtual residency and fellowship education.","output":"Adult Hip and Knee Reconstruction Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is estimated that there are currently over 145,000 people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the UK This progressive neurological condition affects people in a variety of ways, depending on numerous factors, including the impact and severity of their motor and non-motor symptoms In relation to the current Covid-19 pandemic, the UK government identified people with Parkinson's disease as clinically vulnerable, suggesting that they were at higher risk of severe illness if they contracted the Covid-19 virus The subsequent self-imposed isolation could potentially impact on Parkinson's symptom control, and also affect wellbeing and quality of life The Parkinson's disease nurse specialist has had to rapidly adapt service delivery to ensure that the needs of people with Parkinson's disease are addressed, predominantly with remote assessment, during the Covid-19 pandemic","output":"Caring for patients with Parkinson's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, computer simulations have reached amazing graphic results, providing awesome visual descriptions explaining the evolution of very complex physics phenomena, implementing the laws of Nature.

Fractionation is an initial step for isolating lignocellulosic components for subsequent valorization. The aim of this research is to develop the solvothermal fractionation of sugarcane bagasse to produce high purity lignin. The physio-chemical structure of isolated lignin from this process was determined. In this study, a central composite design-based response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize an acid promoter for isolating lignin from sugarcane bagasse using a solvothermal fractionation process. The reaction was carried out with sulfuric acid, at a concentration of 0.01-0.02 M and a reaction temperature of 180-200 C for 30-90 min. The optimal conditions for the experiment were obtained at the acid concentration of 0.02 M with a temperature of 200 C for 90 min in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)/methanol/water (35% : 25% : 40% v/v%). The results showed that 88% of lignin removal was done in the solid phase, while 87% of lignin recovery was conducted in the organic phase. Furthermore, the changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of solid residue and lignin recovery were analyzed using various techniques. GPC analysis of recovered lignin from the organic fraction showed a lower M w (1374 g mol-1) and polydispersity index (1.75) compared to commercial organosolv lignin. The major lignin degradation temperature of commercial organosolv lignin was estimated to be 410 C, whereas BGL showed two main degradations at 291 C and 437 C, which could point to potential relationships with the degradation of ?-O-4 cross-links. The results indicated that recovered lignin was mostly cross-linked by ?-O-4 cross-links. In addition, Py-GC/MS and 2D HSQC NMR gave more information regarding the compositional and structural features of recovered lignin. The development of the sulfuric acid catalyzed solvothermal process in this study provides efficient extraction of high-value organosolv lignin from sugarcane bagasse and the production of recovered lignin in the organic phase with low contamination from other contents.

To understand HCWs fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semistructured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145 000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). PARTICIPANTS: Interview participants were HCWs purposively sampled from critical care, emergency and respiratory departments as well as redeployed HCWs from primary, secondary and tertiary care centres across the UK. RESULTS: A major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to reuse and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about differential access to adequate PPE, particularly for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. CONCLUSION: This study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance.

Growth of reassortant viruses in ammonium chloride-treated cells segregated with the S1 gene of L/C and the S4 gene of PI 2A1 and PI 3-1. The S1 gene encodes viral attachment protein sigma1, and the S4 gene encodes outer-capsid protein sigma3. To identify mutations in sigma3 selected during persistent reovirus infection, we determined the S4 gene nucleotide sequences of L/C, PI 2A1, PI 3-1, and four additional PI viruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of sigma3 protein of six of these PI viruses contained a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at residue 354. To determine whether mutations selected during persistent infection alter cleavage of the viral outer capsid, the fate of viral structural proteins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after treatment of virions of wt and PI viruses with chymotrypsin in vitro. Proteolysis of PI virus outer-capsid proteins sigma3 and mu1C occurred with faster kinetics than proteolysis of wt virus outer-capsid proteins.

Nonesterified fatty acids correlated with absolute and relative NK cell number and cytotoxicity ( [p\\\\value]: 0.142 [0.021], 0.119 [0.049], and 0.131 [0.035], respectively). Relative NK cell number further correlated with high\\\\density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.144 [0.018]) and cytotoxicity with 2 h glucose in oral glucose tolerance testing (0.132 [0.034]). CD69 positivity correlated with body fat (0.141 [0.021]), triglycerides (0.129 [0.033]), and plasma leptin (0.155 [0.010]). After correction for multiple testing, none of the associations remained significant. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we observed no associations of NK cell number and function in the peripheral blood with overweight/obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Extreme phenotypes of obesity and the metabolic syndrome might have caused differing results in previous studies. Further analyses with a focus on compartments other than peripheral blood may help to clarify the relation between NK cells and metabolic diseases.","output":"No association of natural killer cell number and function in peripheral blood with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome in a cohort of young women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Philippines has been under a series of different levels of community quarantine and this affected the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread in the country. Predicting the trajectory has been an interest of various research groups. To provide a more efficient method to estimate the parameters of the Age-Stratified, Quarantine-modified SEIR model with Nonlinear Incidence Rates (ASQ-SEIR-NLIR) other than the shooting method, a genetic algorithm approach is explored. By defining constraints for each parameter, the algorithm arrived at an acceptable optimal value for each parameter. The experiment is done on two regions of interest: the Philippines (country-level) and Quezon City, Metro Manila (city-level). The ASQ-SEIR-NLIR model, using the parameters generated by the genetic algorithm, is able to produce an average trajectory compared to the actual data, which may be deemed noisy. The dynamics of the COVID-19 spread between Quezon City and average country level is compared, showing that the city population is being exposed to the virus at a much faster rate than the country average and may have more asymptomatics not getting tested than the country average. Given the average trajectory, the peak daily infection projection is way lower at 0.0823% of the country population for the country projection and 0.1494% of the Quezon City population for the city projection, which is below than previous literature estimates of 3-10%.","output":"Parameter Estimation for a Modified SEIR Model of theCOVID-19 Dynamics in the Philippines using GeneticAlgorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.7759/cureus.9995.].","output":"Retraction: Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advanced fitting of ordinary differential equations models to experimental results is presented within the context of different academic levels of students and diverse research fields.

The Covid-19 epidemic with 0-exponential contamination curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise, nor should it have been the last pandemic in the world. In this article, we try to summarize the lost opportunities as well as the lessons learned, hoping that we can do better in the future. The objective of this study is to relate the situation of Covid-19 in African countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic. It also allows us to verify how, according to the observed situation, the African ecosystem seems to be much more resilient compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is in the thousands. To verify this, the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported for different states of the world are compared to the ages of life and the average annual temperature of these states. The results show that the less dramatic balance of the African continent compared to other continents is partly linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population.","output":"A DISSYMMETRY IN THE FIGURES RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE WORLD: WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AFRICA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depersonalisation is a common dissociative experience characterised by distressing feelings of being detached or estranged from ones self and body and/or the world.

We have conducted an online study of 622 participants worldwide to investigate the relationship between digital media-based activities, distal social interactions and peoples sense of self during the lockdown as contrasted with before the pandemic. We found that increased use of digital media-based activities and online social e-meetings correlated with higher feelings of depersonalisation. We also found that the participants reporting higher experiences of depersonalisation, also reported enhanced vividness of negative emotions (as opposed to positive emotions). Finally, participants who reported that lockdown influenced their life to a greater extent had higher occurrences of depersonalisation experiences. Our findings may help to address key questions regarding well-being during a lockdown, in the general population.

Previous research conducted on student views towards an online undergraduate anatomy and physiology course revealed areas of both strong preference (e.g., asynchronous lectures) and strong dislike (e.g., virtual specimens) within the online format. As restrictions are lessened and students transition back into in-person learning, there exists the unique opportunity to examine the views of a consistent cohort of students towards virtual and in-person modes of course delivery. OBJECTIVE The current study seeks to compare the views of a single cohort of students experiencing both the online and in-person anatomy and physiology course. To avoid the considerable drawbacks of course evaluations relying on Likert scales and traditional qualitative analysis, Q-methodology is being used to measure the different perspectives of students between the two teaching modalities. METHOD Q-methodology will be used to assess opinions of students enrolled in the same undergraduate introductory anatomy and physiology course.A list of 41 opinion-based statements regarding anatomy education was compiled. Students will sort the statements in a quasi-normal grid based on their degree of agreement with the statements. The rankings will then undergo a by-person factor analysis which categorizes students with shared perceptions into groups allowing educators to better understand and respond to the needs of students. Students will have the opportunity to respond to the survey at two points: at the end of the Fall 2021 semester after a primarily online mode of delivery, and at the end of the Winter 2022 semester following a primarily in person mode of delivery. RESULTS Data collection and analysis are anticipated to be completed in March of 2022. CONCLUSION We hypothesize that Q-methodology will enable us to discover student views specifically relevant to their experience in both the online and in-person format of the course. We predict that this study will help identify areas of strength in both virtual and in-person learning environments. These findings will be useful in integrating the strengths of both learning environments when developing future course offerings.","output":"Emerging from the Pandemic: Q-Method Analysis of the Return to Normalcy in Undergraduate Anatomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Freetown has over 1 million residents, many of whom live in about 68 crowded informal settlements Residents of these settlements struggle daily to access basic services such as water, sanitation, and health-care services We found that the governments Covid-19 response measures (curfews, lockdowns, and travel restrictions) excluded informal residents from contributing to its design, and the implementation of these measures prevented these residents from accessing basic services Like the urban planning processes in Freetown, the Covid-19 response planning was done with the limited inclusion of informal residents, and not considering how these response measures would affect their livelihood priorities The economic conditions of already vulnerable people such as those living with disabilities, beggars, and women heads of households worsened as a result of these measures While these challenges were dire, communities were resilient in reversing the spread of Covid-19 through tailor-made messaging and by supporting the most vulnerable with food and basic needs In this article we argue that the inclusion of the urban poor in decision-making and urban planning processes can improve service delivery and their ability to cope with health shocks ? 2021 The Authors IDS Bulletin ?

However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular alterations for understanding robust virus propagation yet. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 aberrantly elevates mitochondrial bioenergetics and activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell survival signal cascade for sustaining persistence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 causes increase in mitochondrial transmembrane potential by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-nucleocapsid cluster, thereby abnormally promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process followed by abundant ATP production. SARS-CoV-2 also activated EGFR signal cascade and subsequent mitochondrial EGFR accumulation which contributes to the maintenance of abnormal OXPHOS and viral propagation. Therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19 are still inadequate. The FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors caused a remarkable reduction in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Among EGFR inhibitors, vandetanib showing the highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy exhibited the potent antiviral activity against various SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (SA variant) lineages in both in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal experiments using wild-type aged mouse susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that EGFR is an attractive host target for combatting COVID-19.

Taiwanese did not seem urgently aware, until infections multiplied locally. Taiwan's health authorities eventually adopted a draconian quarantine policy, but mainly as a political tactic to contain the widespread panic, as though the dam had suddenly burst. In retrospect, the extremity and internal contradictions of the policy are remarkable, but they are instructive.

As a result of this, there have been increased legal regulations placed on pangolin trade in recent years. The suggestion that pangolins may have been involved in the transmission of COVID-19 further brought the issues of pangolin consumption to the fore in 2020. However, we have little understanding of the attitudes of the general public towards pangolin consumption pre- or post the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted surveys in Hong Kong, a critical transit hub in the trafficking routes for pangolins, in 2015 (n = 1037) and 2020 (n = 1028) to determine general attitudes towards pangolin consumption in the city, and whether these attitudes changed since the onset of COVID-19. We found low reported rates of pangolin consumption (< 1% of respondents) in both surveys, and most of the respondents who professed to eating pangolins were aged above 50. Perceptions of how trends in pangolin consumption are changing were consistent between 2015 and 2020, with 55% of the public in 2015 and 57% in 2020 believing that consumption has declined over time. In 2020, respondents cited conservation (endangered status of pangolins) and health concerns (risk of disease transmission) as the two primary reasons (> 50%) for declining attitudes toward consumption. Overall, COVID-19 does not, specifically, appear to be associated with changed perceptions of pangolin consumption in Hong Kong: > 75% of respondents stated that there is no relationship between pangolins and COVID-19, or were unsure about any such connection. Only 1% mentioned an awareness of the illegality of pangolin consumption as a reason for not consuming them. As such, our results challenge simple narratives regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pangolin consumption. We suggest that future demand reduction efforts could emphasize the conservation impact and health risks of consuming pangolins, and specifically focus on the older generations. As pangolins continue to be trafficked and threatened with extinction, further research into the perceptions and attitudes of consumers of these products is needed to inform targeted and effective interventions.","output":"Low pangolin consumption in Hong Kong pre- and post- the COVID-19 outbreak: Conservation and health concerns both contribute to peoples attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is no study evaluating the Tpeak-Tend (Tpe) interval, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio to assess cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether there is a change in QT, QTc, Tpe interval, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 90 patients with COVID-19 infection and 30 age-and-sex-matched healthy controls. QT, QTc, Tpe interval, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio were measured. The participants included in the study were divided into the following 4 groups: healthy controls (group I), patients with COVID-19 without pneumonia (group II), patients with COVID-19 and mild pneumonia (group III), and patients with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia (group IV). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: It was found that baseline heart rate, presence of hypertension and diabetes, white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, NT-proBNP, high sensitive C reactive protein, D-dimer, hs-cTnI, Tpe, Tpe/QT, and Tpe/QTc increased from group I to group IV, and they were significantly higher in all patients in group IV (p < 0.05). Systolic-diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, and calcium levels were found to be lowest in group IV and significantly lower than in other groups (< 0.05). QT and QTc intervals were similar between groups. It was determined that increased heart rate, calcium, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and hs-CRP levels were significantly related to Tpe, Tpe/QT, and Tpe/QTc. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia, Tpe, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio, which are among ventricular repolarization parameters, were found to be increased, without prolonged QT and QTc intervals. In this study, we cannot definitively conclude that the ECG changes observed are directly related to COVID-19 infection or inflammation, but rather associated with severe COVID-19 scenarios, which might involve other causes of inflammation and comorbidities.

However, few of these newer technologies are scalable or sustainable globally. To reduce worldwide deaths from NS, one possibility may be performing population-wide pathogen discovery. Because pathogen transmission patterns can vary across space and time, computational models can be built to predict the pathogens responsible for NS by region and season.

Study population was divided into two cohorts Group 1- (1st July 2019-31 st March 2020): before implementation of mandatory face masks Group 2- (1st April 2020-31 st December 2020): after implementation of mandatory face masks RESULTS: Mean Hb of blood donors in Group 2 (15.01  1.1 g/dl) was higher than Group1 (14.49  1.15 g/dl), (p < 0.0001). 47.1 % group2 donors had Hb of 16.1-18 g/dl compared to group1 (38.4 %). 52.9 % group 2 donors had Hb between 12.5-15 g/dl compared to 61.6 % Group 1 (p < 0.05). Deferral due to anemia was lesser in group 2 compared to group 1 (p < 0.00001). Group 2 had significantly higher deferral due to high Hb (>18 gm/dl) was than Group 1 (p = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: This study including 19504 blood donors spanning over one and a half year shows that prolonged use of face mask by blood donors may lead to intermittent hypoxia and consequent increase in hemoglobin mass.","output":"Use of face mask by blood donors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on donor hemoglobin concentration: A bane or a boon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The disease caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly characterized by symptoms related to the upper respiratory tract associated with fever and constitutional symptoms, progressing in the most severe cases to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). However, due to the increasing number of cases, atypical presentations have been found. Among them, thromboembolic manifestations stand out, since the virus itself seems to predispose to changes in the coagulation system. Case Report A 62-year-old male patient who underwent cardiac transplantation 6 months ago, secondary to chagasic cardiomyopathy, had pain and edema in his left foot for 1 week. Upon admission, he was eupneic, afebrile, heart rate of 96bpm, blood pressure of 120  70mmhg, with edema and erythema on his left foot. Chagas reactivation, cellulite or deep vein thrombosis were the diagnostic hypotheses suggested. Soft tissue ultrasound and venous doppler of the left lower limb were compatible with deep venous thrombosis and superficial thrombophlebitis. Skin lesion biopsy confirmed Chagas reactivation. Antibiotic therapy with cefazolin, full anticoagulation with enoxaparin and treatment with benzonidazole were introduced. In the second day of hospitalization, patient presented myalgia and dry cough, in addition to an increased C-reactive protein and multiple ground-glass opacities on computed tomography of the chest, suggestive of COVID-19. This finding was corroborated by a positive result of RT-PCR for SARS-COV2. The patient evolved with SARS, requiring progressive use of vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventilation and pronation. Summary It is currently known that COVID-19 increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in hospitalized patients, reaching an incidence of 25%, even in the presence of effective prophylaxis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this association, but not with robust evidence. Despite these increased cases, there are no reports in the literature of initial presentation with a thromboembolic event in a heart transplant patient, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion and appropriate investigation.","output":"Venous Thromboembolism as an Initial Manifestation of COVID-19 in a Heart Transplant Patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This systematic review sought to evaluate the effectiveness of non-facilitated meaningful activities for older people with dementia in long-term care facilities.

One of the common strategies adopted by shipping lines to efficiently serve the existing customers is the deployment of large ships. The current practice in the liner shipping industry is to deploy a combination of ships of different types with different carrying capacities (i.e., heterogeneous fleet), especially at the routes with a significant demand. However, heterogeneous fleets of ships have been investigated by a very few studies addressing the tactical liner shipping decisions (i.e., determination of service frequency, ship fleet deployment, optimization of ship sailing speed, and design of ship schedules). Moreover, limited research efforts have been carried out to simultaneously capture all the major tactical liner shipping decisions using a single solution methodology. Therefore, this study proposes an integrated optimization model that addresses all the major tactical liner shipping decisions and allows the deployment of a heterogeneous ship fleet at each route, considering emissions generated throughout liner shipping operations. The model's objective maximizes the total turnaround profit generated from liner shipping operations. A decomposition-based heuristic algorithm is presented in this study to solve the model proposed and efficiently tackle large-size problem instances. Numerical experiments, carried out for a number of real-world liner shipping routes, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

The 92 isolates were mixed with fecal specimens and tested on four ESBL screening media; ChromID ESBL (BioMrieux), Brilliance ESBL (Oxoid), BLSE agar (AES Chemunex) and CHROMagar ESBL (CHROMagar). The BLSE agar is a biplate consisting of two different agars. Brilliance and CHROMagar are supposed to suppress growth of AmpC-producing bacteria while ChromID and BLSE agar are intended to detect both ESBL(A) and AmpC. RESULTS The total sensitivity (ESBL(A)+AmpC) with 95% confidence intervals after 24 hours of incubation were as follows: ChromID: 95% (90.4-99.6), Brilliance: 93% (87.6-98.4), BLSE agar (Drigalski): 99% (96.9-100), BLSE agar (MacConkey): 99% (96.9-100) and CHROMagar: 85% (77.5-92.5).

METHODS Randomised controlled trials were collected from five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PsycINFO). Meta-analyses were conducted using change scores from baseline to determine mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the quality of the evidence. RESULTS A total of 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and 21 were included in meta-analyses. Behaviour change interventions significantly increased physical activity (SMD: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.07, p < 0.01), and resulted in significant reductions in body mass (MD: -2.74; 95% CI: - 4.42 to - 1.07, p < 0.01), body mass index (MD: -0.99; 95% CI: - 1.48 to - 0.50, p < 0.01) and waist circumference (MD: -2.21; 95% CI: - 4.01 to - 0.42, p = 0.02). The GRADE assessment indicated that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of behaviour change interventions on changes in physical activity and anthropometrics in ambulatory hospital patients.

Data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with and without elevated cTnI. The cTnI were further divided in 4 tertiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for demographics, baseline comorbidities, and laboratory parameters including D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Out of 309 patients, 116 (37.5%) had elevated cTnI. Those with elevated cTnI were older (59.9 vs. 68.2 years, p <0.001), and more likely to be males (53.5% vs. 36.3%, pa?=a?0.003). Elevated cTnI group had higher baseline comorbidities. After multivariable adjustment, overall mortality was significantly higher in elevated cTnI group (37.9% vs. 11.4%, odds ratio:4.45; confidence interval:1.78 to 11.14, p <0.001).

METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, PEDro, and Cochrane library were searched up to October 1, 2020 to identify RCTs evaluating Tai Chi for improving walking function and posture control in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes were walking function and posture control. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan Version 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 603 participants with knee osteoarthritis in the 11 trials were included.

All patients were followed up for 3 months after discharge. The symptomatic features and follow-up data of the patients in both groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60.0%), cough (50.8%) and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms. In total, 32.7% of the severe cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, which was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group (P = 0.0015). The incidence of olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia was only 3.1% and 6.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for over 5 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.26-5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (OR 14.19, 95% CI 7.01-28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Online misinformation is also correlated with vaccine hesitancy rates taken from survey data. Associations between vaccine outcomes and misinformation remain significant when accounting for political as well as demographic and socioeconomic factors. While vaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with Republican vote share, we observe that the effect of online misinformation on hesitancy is strongest across Democratic rather than Republican counties.

Both drugs can alter cardiac electrophysiology and have been associated with drug-induced arrhythmias. Meanwhile, sympathetic activation is commonly observed during systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2 infection) and may influence the electrophysiological effects of CQ and AZM. Here, we investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on proarrhythmic properties of CQ and AZM using detailed in silico models of ventricular electrophysiology. Concentration-dependent alterations in ion-channel function were incorporated into the Heijman canine and OHara-Rudy human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. Single and combined drug effects on action-potential (AP) properties were analyzed using a population of 1,000 models accommodating inter-individual variability. Sympathetic stimulation was simulated by increasing pacing rate and experimentally validated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in ion-channel function. In the canine ventricular model at 1 Hz pacing, therapeutic doses of CQ and AZM (5 and 20 M, respectively) individually prolonged AP duration (APD) by 33 and 13%. Their combination produced synergistic APD prolongation (+161%) with incidence of proarrhythmic early afterdepolarizations in 53.5% of models. Increasing the pacing frequency to 2 Hz shortened APD and together with 1 M ISO counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. No afterdepolarizations occurred following increased rate and simulated application of ISO. Similarly, CQ and AZM individually prolonged APD by 43 and 29% in the human ventricular cardiomyocyte model, while their combination prolonged APD by 76% without causing early afterdepolarizations. Consistently, 1 M ISO at 2 Hz pacing counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. Increasing the I(Ca,L) window current produced afterdepolarizations, which were exacerbated by ISO. In both models, reduced extracellular K(+) reduced the repolarization reserve and increased drug effects. In conclusion, CQ- and AZM-induced proarrhythmia is promoted by conditions with reduced repolarization reserve. Sympathetic stimulation limits drug-induced APD prolongation, suggesting the potential importance of heart rate and autonomic status monitoring in particular conditions (e.g., COVID-19).","output":"Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation Modulates the Cellular Proarrhythmic Effects of Chloroquine and Azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerged pandemic disease caused by a new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2).","output":"COVID-19-associated spontaneous subacute subdural haematoma: report of one case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Due to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been proven to survive in aerosols for hours.

A theoretical time-correction P est was applied to a size-dependent P avg by proposing a correction coefficient r, and the error analysis of the real-time P(t) and the derived P d were also performed. The results indicated that P avg supplied the most stable values for laboratory penetration simulations. However, the time-correction is of little significance under current experimental conditions. P(t) and P d are suitable for rough evaluation under certain conditions due to the inevitability of particles detaching and re-entering after capture.

Materials and Methods: The SAF adopted a systematic approach to telemedicine implementation and scaling up, with Phase 1 being the deployment of medical teams operating on-site clinics daily at six CRFs and telemedicine only provided for after-hours medical consultations on an ad hoc basis. Subsequently in Phase 2, most clinical consultations in the CRFs were conducted virtually. Results: Phases 1 and 2 recorded 1,902 and 449 clinical consultations, respectively. The mean number of clinical encounters was 33 per 1,000 occupants per day in Phase 1, and 12 per 1,000 occupants per day in Phase 2 (p < 0.001). Acute respiratory illness (52.3% in Phase 1 and 46.7% in Phase 2) was the most common reason for consultations. With full telemedicine in Phase 2, there was reduction in the mean number of clinical encounters per 1,000 occupants per day (p = 0.001), lower man-hours in personal protective equipment (PPE) (p < 0.001), and rise in escalation of care (p < 0.001) but without adverse events reported. Conclusions: Telemedicine for patients was safe, improved medical manpower efficiency, and reduced man-hours in PPE. The increased escalation of care in Phase 2 due to the lack of physical examination capabilities was to be expected to ensure patients' safety.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the health care system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), collected from August 2020 to January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in wastewater, and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically important SARS-CoV-2 variants along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. Specific to public health, WBE has proven valuable during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to track the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without adding burden to health care systems. In this study, we used metatranscriptomics and reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) to assay RNA viruses across Southern California wastewater from August 2020 to January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. We found that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater correlates well with county-wide COVID-19 case data, and that we can detect SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variants through sequencing. Likewise, wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) harbored different viromes, and we detected other human pathogens, such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, furthering our understanding of wastewater viral ecology.","output":"RNA Viromics of Southern California Wastewater and Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Single-Nucleotide Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding concepts of food engineering (FE) is fundamental for professionals in the discipline, necessary for food scientists, appealing to non-food science students, and valuable for curious cooks.

Cigarette smoking is the most important causal factor for developing COPD. Cadmium, a minor metallic element, is one of the main inorganic components in tobacco smoke. Inhaled cadmium was associated with a decline in lung function, gas exchange impairment, and the development of obstructive lung disease. Patients with COPD who had oxygen desaturation during the 6-min walk test (6MWT) had a significantly worse prognosis than non-desaturation in COPD patients. Nonetheless, few studies have addressed the influence of blood cadmium levels on exercise-induced oxygen desaturation in COPD patients. Our objective was to assess the potential impact of blood cadmium levels on oxygen desaturation during the 6MWT among COPD patients. Materials and Methods: we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with COPD who were examined for blood cadmium levels in a tertiary care referral center in Taiwan, between March 2020 and May 2021. The 6-min walk test was performed. Normal control subjects who had no evidence of COPD were also enrolled. Results: a total of 73 COPD patients were analyzed and stratified into the high-blood cadmium group (13 patients) and low-blood cadmium group (60 patients). A total of 50 normal control subjects without a diagnosis of COPD were enrolled. The high-blood cadmium group had a significantly higher extent of desaturation than the low-blood cadmium group. The frequency of desaturation during 6MWT revealed a stepwise-increasing trend with an increase in blood cadmium levels. A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that blood cadmium levels were independently associated with desaturation during the 6MWT (odds ratio 12.849 [95% CI 1.168C141.329]; p = 0.037). Conclusions: our findings indicate that blood cadmium levels, within the normal range, were significantly associated with desaturation during 6MWT in patients with COPD.","output":"Blood Cadmium Levels and Oxygen Desaturation during the 6-Minute Walk Test in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Korea, and social distancing was implemented to prevent its spread. This reduced the movement of people, and changes in air quality were expected owing to reduced emissions. In the present paper, the impact of traffic volume change caused by COVID-19 on air quality in Seoul, Korea, is examined. Two regression analyses were performed using the generalized additive model (GAM), assuming a Gaussian distribution; the relationships between (1) the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 2020C2021 and the rate of change in the traffic volume in Seoul, and (2) the traffic volume and the rate of change in the air quality in Seoul from 2016 to 2019 were analyzed. The regression results show that traffic decreased by 0.00431% per COVID-19 case; when traffic fell by 1%, the PM(10), PM(2.5), CO, NO(2), O(3), and SO(2) concentrations fell by 0.48%, 0.94%, 0.39%, 0.74%, 0.16%, and ?0.01%, respectively.

Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule.

The primary reasons for this resurgence are the waning immunity of vaccination after the second dose of vaccination and the changes in public behavior due to temporal convergence.

Here, we numerically derived the effectiveness of vaccination for infection protection in individuals and populations against viral variants for the entire Japanese population (126 million).

In light of recent events, this research considers spatial interferences among workspaces as occasions of COVID-19 transmission, which must be avoided. The number of spatial issues detected in previous studies must be extended by also including spatial conflicts affecting crews moving to and from main workspaces in transfer spaces (i.e., the support workspaces).

The possibility of simulating working operations in gaming environments enables investigating on how behavioral constraints, such as social distancing, can be considered during work planning. The first research outcome is that the developed prototype can read the work plan and the BIM model to provide spatial interferences due not only to the main but also to the support workspaces.

To determine the poorly understood role of ?-arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent ?-arrestin/AP2 interaction and ?-arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/?-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of ?-arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in ?-arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis revealed that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of ?-arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of ?-arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis.

METHODS: A total of 34 patients were divided into two groups, including those who required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 11 patients. Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The rates of the acute cardiac and kidney complications were higher in IMV cases than those in NIV cases. Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit in Hangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les donnes concernant la COVID-19 sont limites chez les patients hmodialyss chroniques.

It is noted that in the process of assessing the scale of current problems there is a need for a detailed study of the content, types, factors, and ways of spreading threats / threats to socioeconomic security of Ukraine, which have long accumulated in the economic sphere. It is determined that the release of citizens from the branches of the national economy, suspended due to quarantine;reduction of household incomes and rising prices for goods that have no substitutes;reduction of aggregate supply and demand in case of loss of markets;increase in receivables of enterprises and the general deterioration of their financial condition. All countries, markets, businesses, firms and other economic institutions have somehow coped with the effects of the pandemic. This is easily explained by the relatively rapid integration into the world economy through international trade, financial flows and labor migration. Another factor of economic instability was the rapid expansion of services. Despite the growing importance for society and employment, services are most at risk of a pandemic. Sectors of the economy that were under strong pressure under the influence of the coronavirus crisis are highlighted. The macrofinancial indicators of Ukraine for 2018-2020 are analyzed. Thus, there is a stable growth of GDP (in actual prices) throughout the study period, which indicates an increase in domestic production capacity. In 2019, this figure increased by 111.7% compared to 2018, and in 2020 this figure showed an increase of 105.5%. The total amount of public and state-guaranteed debt will increase during 2018-2020.

Previously, a large portion of these recipients also produced recipient-derived progeny, making them gonadal chimeras. These were potentially created when portions of the recipient's ovary were inadvertently left behind. Completely removing the recipient ovary would solve this problem; however, leaving a portion of the recipient's ovary may have inadvertently increased the transplant attachment rate by providing a damaged area for attachment. To test this hypothesis in the turkey, we removed various portions (33-100%) of recipient ovarian tissue and determined the transplant attachment rate. Furthermore, the use of the abdominal air sac membrane as an additional anchoring point was tested. The overall attachment rate of transplants was 91% (27/30), while the average size of the transplants was 4.2  0.6 mm2, 6 d postsurgery. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in the attachment rates, or transplant size between groups with varying amounts of recipent tissue removed, or by using the abdominal air sac membrane as an anchor. Finally, the immunological status of the grafts were evaluated by analyzing the presences of CD3 and MUM-1 (T and B cell markers). This showed that all transplants were infiltrated by large numbers of T and B cells. Shown by a high (P  0.001) percentage of CD3-positive immunostained cytoplasmic area (49.78  3.90%) in transplants compared to remnant recipient tissue (0.30  0.10%), as well as a high (P  0.001) percentage of MUM-1-positive immunostained nuclear area (9.85  1.95%) in transplants over remnant recipient tissues (0.39  0.12%). From this study we would recommend removing the entire recipient ovary, and not covering the transplants with the abdominal air sac membrane, to prevent gonadal chimeras. The high levels of lymphocytes within the grafts indicate possible tissue rejection, which could be overcome via immunosuppression with or without histocompatibility matching between donors and recipients.","output":"Turkey ovarian tissue transplantation: effects of surgical technique on graft attachment and immunological status of the grafts, 6 days post-surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, religious services worldwide were forced to migrate online.

Moreover, the demand for dialysis resources has significantly increased since many COVID-19 patients need acute dialysis due to kidney failure. In this study, we address capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic located within a major hospital in Istanbul, designated to serve both infected and uninfected patients during the pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The hemodialysis clinic applies a three-unit cohorting strategy to treat four types of patients in separate units and at different times to mitigate infection spread risk among patients. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the clinic needs to determine the number of available dialysis machines to allocate to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. Given the uncertainties in the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis, it is a challenge to allocate the scarce dialysis resources effectively by evaluating which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions of infected and uninfected patients over a week. We represent the uncertainties in the number of patients by a set of scenarios and present a two-stage stochastic programming approach to support capacity allocation decisions of the clinic.

Transmitters were individuals who had onset date prior to their infected social contact. Throat and nasal samples were analysed for multiple viruses by RT-PCR. Five viruses were involved in 18 transmission events (influenza A, parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, respiratory syncytial virus). Transmitters had higher numbers of co-infections (67%). Identified transmission events had contacts reported in small classes (33%), dormitory common areas (22%) and dormitory rooms (17%).

It can compensate for the lack of trained geriatricians and integrate CGA in different healthcare disciplines leading to better clinical outcomes. This study assessed the usability of a self-administered geriatric assessment smartphone application. METHODS A cross-sectional study included participants from the geriatric clinic at Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. This study was performed in three phases: development and validation of an abbreviated geriatric assessment tool, and validation of the application prototype. Twenty subjects were recruited for pretesting the abbreviated assessment tool, then another 50 patients to validate this tool in a face-to-face interview. Afterwards, another 12 patients completed the prototype followed by a standardized office visit interview. Each assessment domain was evaluated in agreement with a valid reference test during the clinical interview. RESULTS The application was simple and user friendly. The scores of each domain correlated to the reference test scores (rho = 0.59-0.93). Most of the domains exhibited good agreement with the reference tests (kappa = 0.68-1.00) (except for frailty and nutritional assessment). CONCLUSIONS The mHealth geriatric assessment is possible and highly desirable during physical distancing and beyond. Obviously, this approach cannot substitute for clinical examination and multidisciplinary standard CGA. However, it may overcome some barriers facing the geriatrization of medicine.

Prenatal care could be a very good opportunity for TB care, especially for women who have limited access to health services. The aim of this review was to gather and evaluate studies on TB care for pregnant women. METHODS: We used a combination of the terms tuberculosis and pregnancy, limited to human, to search for published articles. Studies reflecting original data and focusing on TB care for pregnant women were included. All references retrieved were collected using the Reference Manager software (Version 11). RESULTS: Thirty five studies were selected for review and their data showed that diagnosis was often delayed because TB symptoms during pregnancy were not typical. TB prophylaxis and anti-TB therapy appeared to be safe and effective for pregnant women and their babies when suitable follow up and early initiation were present, but the compliance rate to TB prophylaxis is still low due to lack of follow up and referral services. TB care practices in the reviewed studies were in line in principle with the WHO International Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ISTC).

This study represents a preplanned 6-month postimplementation evaluation guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. METHODS: The implementation outcomes evaluated were reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. To evaluate effectiveness, the association of CPG adherence on hospital admission with clinical outcomes was assessed via multivariable logistic regression and nearest neighbor propensity score matching. A time-to-event analysis was conducted. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the competing risk of death prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The models were risk adjusted to account for age, gender, race/ethnicity, non-English speaking status, area deprivation index, month of admission, remdesivir treatment, tocilizumab treatment, steroid treatment, BMI, Elixhauser comorbidity index, oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, treating hospital, and source of admission. A preplanned subgroup analysis was also conducted in patients who had laboratory values (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, creatinine, and absolute neutrophil to absolute lymphocyte ratio) present. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the need for ICU admission within 48 hours of hospital admission. RESULTS: A total of 2503 patients were included in this study. CDS reach approached 95% during implementation. Adherence achieved a peak of 72% during implementation. Variation was noted in adoption across sites and nursing units. Adoption was the highest at hospitals that were specifically transformed to only provide care to patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19 cohorted hospitals; 74%-82%) and the lowest in academic settings (47%-55%). CPG delivery via the CDS system was associated with improved adherence (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% CI 1.2-1.7; P<.001). Adherence with the anticoagulation CPG was associated with a significant reduction in the need for ICU admission within 48 hours (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30-0.51; P<.001) on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Similar findings were noted following 1:1 propensity score matching for patients who received adherent versus nonadherent care (21.5% vs 34.3% incidence of ICU admission within 48 hours; log-rank test P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our institutional experience demonstrated that adherence with the institutional CPG delivered via the CDS system resulted in improved clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19.

Clinical decision support (CDS) is critically important to chronic care providers, and CDS malfunction is common during times of change. It is essential to regularly reassess an organization's ambulatory CDS program to maintain care quality. This is especially true after an immense change, like the COVID-19 telemedicine expansion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to reassess the ambulatory CDS program at a large academic medical center in light of telemedicine's expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Our clinical informatics team devised a practical framework for an intrapandemic ambulatory CDS assessment focused on the impact of the telemedicine expansion. This assessment began with a quantitative analysis comparing CDS alert performance in the context of in-person and telemedicine visits. Board-certified physician informaticists then completed a formal workflow review of alerts with inferior performance in telemedicine visits. Informaticists then reported on themes and optimization opportunities through the existing CDS governance structure. RESULTS: Our assessment revealed that 10 of our top 40 alerts by volume were not firing as expected in telemedicine visits. In 3 of the top 5 alerts, providers were significantly less likely to take action in telemedicine when compared to office visits. Cumulatively, alerts in telemedicine encounters had an action taken rate of 5.3% (3257/64,938) compared to 8.3% (19,427/233,636) for office visits. Observations from a clinical informaticist workflow review included the following: (1) Telemedicine visits have different workflows than office visits. Some alerts developed for the office were not appearing at the optimal time in the telemedicine workflow. (2) Missing clinical data is a common reason for the decreased alert firing seen in telemedicine visits. (3) Remote patient monitoring and patient-reported clinical data entered through the portal could replace data collection usually completed in the office by a medical assistant or registered nurse. CONCLUSIONS: In a large academic medical center at the pandemic epicenter, an intrapandemic ambulatory CDS assessment revealed clinically significant CDS malfunctions that highlight the importance of reassessing ambulatory CDS performance after the telemedicine expansion.","output":"Giving Your Electronic Health Record a Checkup After COVID-19: A Practical Framework for Reviewing Clinical Decision Support in Light of the Telemedicine Expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

Navigational cues orient individuals towards a destination, while it has been demonstrated that communication between individuals enhances navigation through a reduction in orientation error. We develop a mathematical model of collective navigation that synthesizes navigational cues and perception of other individuals. Crucially, this approach incorporates uncertainty inherent to cue interpretation and perception in the decision making process, which can arise due to noisy environments. We demonstrate that collective navigation is more efficient than individual navigation, provided a threshold number of other individuals are perceptible. This benefit is even more pronounced in low navigation information environments. In navigation 'blindspots', where no information is available, navigation is enhanced through a relay that connects individuals in information-poor regions to individuals in information-rich regions. As an expository case study, we apply our framework to minke whale migration in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, and quantify the decrease in navigation ability due to anthropogenic noise pollution.","output":"Modelling collective navigation via non-local communication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Increases in emotional distress in response to the global outbreak of the SARSCoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic have been reported. So far, little is known about how anxiety responses in specific everyday public life situations have been affected. Method: Self-reported anxiety in selected public situations, which are relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, was investigated in non-representative samples from the community (n = 352) and patients undergoing psychotherapy (n = 228). Situational anxiety in each situation was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no anxiety at all to 4 = very strong anxiety). Situational anxiety during the pandemic was compared with retrospectively reported situational anxiety before the pandemic (direct change) and with anxiety levels in a matched sample assessed before the pandemic (n = 100;indirect change). Results: In the community and patient sample, indirect and direct change analyses demonstrated an increase in anxiety in relevant public situations but not in control situations. Average anxiety levels during the pandemic were moderate, but 5-28% of participants reported high to very high levels of anxiety in specific situations. Interestingly, the direct increase in anxiety levels was higher in the community sample: patients reported higher anxiety levels than the community sample before, but not during the pandemic. Finally, a higher increase in situational anxiety was associated with a higher perceived danger of COVID-19, a higher perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, and stronger symptoms of general anxiety and stress. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate an increase in anxiety in public situations during the COVID-19 pandemic in a community and a patient sample. Moderate anxiety may facilitate compliance with public safety measures. However, high anxiety levels may result in persistent impairments and should be monitored during the pandemic. ? 2021 PsychOpen.

It is one of the main targets for the construction of vaccine candidates against Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the vaccines have met failure due to adverse reactions and toxicity reported during late clinical studies. To overcome this, an immunoinformatics approach is being used in the present study for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine to circumvent the problems related to toxicity and allergenicity. RESULTS: In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus targeting TSST-1 was designed through an immunoinformatics approach. B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted in silico and mapped with linkers to avoid junctional immunogenicity and to ensure the efficient presentation of exposed epitopes through HLA. ?-defensin and PADRE were adjusted at the N-terminal end of the final vaccine as adjuvants. Physiochemical parameters, antigenicity, and allergenicity of the vaccine construct were determined with the help of online servers. The three-dimensional structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and validated with various tools. The affinity of the vaccine with TLR-3 was studied through molecular docking studies and the interactions of two proteins were visualized using LigPlot+. The vaccine was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (+) for efficient expression in E. coli K12 system. Population coverage analysis had shown that the vaccine construct can cover 83.15% of the global population. Immune simulation studies showed an increase in the antibody levels, IL-2, IFN-?3, TGF-?, B cell, and T cell populations and induced primary, secondary, and tertiary immune responses. CONCLUSION: Multi-epitope vaccine designed through a computational approach is a non-allergic and non-toxic antigen.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we intended to study alterations in the mental health status of Portuguese physicians working at the COVID-19 frontline, and potential sociodemographic factors influencing this status. METHODS: A national survey was applied from 4 to 25 of May 2020 to infer differences in mental health status (depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) between Portuguese physicians working at the frontline of COVID-19 (FRONT) and other physicians that were not working at the frontline (NFRONT). A representative sample of 420 participants stratified by age, sex, and the geographic region was analyzed (200 FRONT participants and 220 NFRONT individuals). Moreover, we explored the influence of several sociodemographic factors on mental health variables (age, sex, living conditions, and household composition).

Nevertheless, it has requirements such as prolonged attention, stable fixation, and a need for a motor response that limit application in various patient groups. Therefore, a novel approach using eye movements (EMs) C as a complementary technique to SAP C was developed and tested in clinical settings by our group. However, the original method uses a screen-based eye-tracker which still requires participants to keep their chin and head stable. Virtual reality (VR) has shown much promise in ophthalmic diagnostics C especially in terms of freedom of head movement and precise control over experimental settings, besides being portable. In this study, we set out to see if patients can be screened for VFDs based on their EM in a VR-based framework and if they are comparable to the screen-based eyetracker. Moreover, we wanted to know if this framework can provide an effective and enjoyable user experience (UX) compared to our previous approach and the conventional SAP. Therefore, we first modified our method and implemented it on a VR head-mounted device with built-in eye tracking. Subsequently, 15 controls na?ve to SAP, 15 patients with a neuro-ophthalmological disorder, and 15 glaucoma patients performed three tasks in a counterbalanced manner: (1) a visual tracking task on the VR headset while their EM was recorded, (2) the preceding tracking task but on a conventional screen-based eye tracker, and (3) SAP. We then quantified the spatio-temporal properties (STP) of the EM of each group using a cross-correlogram analysis. Finally, we evaluated the humanCcomputer interaction (HCI) aspects of the participants in the three methods using a user-experience questionnaire. We find that: (1) the VR framework can distinguish the participants according to their oculomotor characteristics; (2) the STP of the VR framework are similar to those from the screen-based eye tracker; and (3) participants from all the groups found the VR-screening test to be the most attractive. Thus, we conclude that the EM-based approach implemented in VR can be a user-friendly and portable companion to complement existing perimetric techniques in ophthalmic clinics.","output":"Patients Prefer a Virtual Reality Approach Over a Similarly Performing Screen-Based Approach for Continuous Oculomotor-Based Screening of Glaucomatous and Neuro-Ophthalmological Visual Field Defects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chains are today confronted with more uncertainties than ever before In the face of unanticipated disruptions, being resilient and sustainable has been rewarding for supply chains in terms of competitive advantage However, literature is still far from possessing an encompassing sustainable supply chain framework (SSCF) As a contribution to the extant literature, the present study expounds a prominent concept termed negative entropy and explores its role in the SSCF To accomplish this goal, the effect of negative entropy on supply chain sustainability is tested Following the open systems theory and drawing from the collaboration and information management aspects of the negative entropy, co-creation, open innovation and network governance concepts which are considered to be relevant in this context are selected to be the antecedents of negative entropy The empirical research is conducted on prominent logistics service providers and firms from various sectors with approved research and development departments in Turkey The obtained data were subjected to covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis via Lisrel program According to results, negative entropy is found to be a robust element in explaining supply chain sustainability Furthermore, whereas co-creation and network governance reflected significant effects on negative entropy, surprisingly, open innovation demonstrated no substantial impact This paper opens up a new front in sustainable supply chain management studies with a notable empirical study introducing negative entropy in the context of open systems theory","output":"The Role of Negative Entropy within Supply Chain Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is responsible of variable clinical manifestations, ranging from no symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure resulting in death.

This study employed a mixed methods design. Quantitative data was gathered from an online survey to assess the prevalence, demographics, and food insecurity status from undergraduate students at Mississippi State University. The 1157 survey respondents then provided the recruitment pool for qualitative data collection, which was obtained via focus groups and open-ended questionnaires to explore student perspectives of food insecurity and food access resources. SPSS 27 was used to determine food security status based on the USDA's Household Food Security Survey Module 6-item short form. NVivo 12 was used for coding and thematic analyses to examine college student perspectives of food insecurity and food access resources. The prevalence of food insecurity among college students was 34.1%. Key influencers emerged as the major theme associated with students' views about food insecurity, and the resources available to address the issue. These influencers were personal beliefs, life skills, and the university. Student perceptions of what it means to need food access resources and the value of a resource were interconnected. Food insecurity continues to occur at a higher prevalence in college student populations than in U.S. households.

However, since COVID-19 testing is now easily available, there is a need to evaluate whether routine testing should be performed for asymptomatic health care workers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a quantitative analysis of the predicted impact that regular testing of health care workers for COVID-19 may have on the prevention of the disease among emergency department patients and staff. METHODS: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic staff members of the emergency department in COVID-19Caffected regions. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and developed a Markov model based on the average incubation period for COVID-19. RESULTS: Our model predicts that after 180 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections/person(2), weekly COVID-19 testing of health care workers would reduce new health care worker and patient infections by approximately 3%-5.9%, and biweekly testing would reduce infections in both by 1%-2.1%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections/person(2), weekly testing would reduce infections by 11%-23% and biweekly testing would reduce infections by 5.5%-13%. At a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections/person(2), weekly and biweekly COVID-19 testing for health care workers would result in an approximately 1% and 0.5%-0.8% reduction in infections, respectively.

Within the structure of cities, it is in urban neighbourhoods that climate action becomes tangible and has the potential to engage communities.

The objective of our paper is to provide an overview of the role of neighbourhoods in leading bottom-up climate action and its implications for urban planning based on a qualitative scoping review. Our findings indicate that neighbourhoods are conceptualized as a physically bounded scale for climate action as well as a web of social networks and relationships enabling this action. Neighbourhood climate action aims to achieve neighbourhood scale sustainability and resilience by engaging with residents, municipalities, local academic institutions, neighbourhood associations and non-governmental agencies. Scholars engage with a wide range of concepts like place-based attachment and social mobilization as well as established practice-oriented tools in defining and measuring neighbourhood climate action.

Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. By maintaining the minimum stock of vaccines under a given production rate, we evaluate the dose interval that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to vaccinate the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the best strategy of time window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the best window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths.

This retrospective study primarily aimed to evaluate the outcomes and complications of anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) transfer in patients who were postoperatively treated with or without low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) calcium. METHODS This was a retrospective study. The sample comprised patients who underwent ALT transfer between January 2015 and January 2020 in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Second Xiangya Hospital. The predictor variable was LMWH. The outcome variable was flap compromise. Other study variables were age, sex, defect location, hypertension, diabetes, number of vein anastomoses, alcohol history, radiation history, and hematoma. Descriptive, bivariate, and regression statistics were computed, and the P value was set at 0.05. RESULTS The sample was composed of 2460 patients, comprising 2,234 males and 226 females, with a mean age of 50.5 years (range, 19-79 years). Based on the use of LMWH, the patients were divided into experimental and control groups. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics between the groups. Moreover, there were no significant differences in flap compromise or hematoma incidence between the groups. In the logistic regression model for flap compromise, the only factor found to be associated with flap compromise was hematoma (P < .0001).

We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1 in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus.

The virus can also interact with ACE-2 receptors expressed in other tissues as in thyroid. This study predicted the complications involving the thyroid in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 11, 2020-May 31, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-nine patients who were radiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 according to thoracic CT and had previously performed thoracic CT before November 2019 were included in the study according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Age and gender-matched controls (No. 69) were selected with normal thoracic CT whose PCR tests were also negative. Thyroid densities of participants were calculated and compared from the previous and current thoracic CTs. Results were also compared with the control group. RESULTS: Participants were composed of 69 patients (39 male, mean age 64.35 years). Thyroid densities were significantly decreased from 89HU to 76HU for whole gland, from 88HU to 76HU for right lobes and from 87.5HU to 75.5HU for left lobes at current thoracic CTs performed during COVID-19 (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001 respectively). The decrease in densities of the whole thyroid gland, both left and right lobes, was correlated with mortality (p<0.001). The changes in thyroid densities were not correlated with age nor gender. The decreases in HU values of thyroid densities for whole gland, left and right lobes, were correlated with mortality (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001 respectively).

We followed a total of 1040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from S?o Paulo, Brazil, from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. We used routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). We used a random sample of 70% of patients to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other. All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale.

Methods: Sixty prepubertal male Wistar rats were distributed into two groups. Group 1 (Ischemia) animals (n=30) were divided into 5 subgroups (n=6). All animals were subjected to right testicular torsion of 720 lasting one hour followed by detorsion. Testicles were collected and arterial blood samples taken from abdominal aorta at the end of ischemic period and 0.5, 1, 6 and 24 hours following detorsion. The remaining rats (Group 2 - Sham operated) were divided into 5 subgroups and submitted to a similar procedure but detorsion was performed immediately following torsion of the right testis. Results: ATP and glucose concentrations were significantly decreased (P 0.05) in ischemia group as compared to sham group at the end of ischemic period. There was no difference in glycemia when comparing ischemic versus sham-operated rats. Conclusions: Unilateral one-hour testicular torsion causes a decrease in ipsilateral testicular perfusion resulting in decreased testicular concentrations of glucose and ATP. This finding suggests that one-hour unilateral testicular torsion impairs testicular capacity to produce ATP (energy) due to glucose storage depletion and reduced glucose uptake. Similar concentrations of glucose and ATP in testicular tissues of rats submitted to ischemia (Group 1) and sham-operated rats (Group 2) following detorsion implies the possible reversibility of these changes.","output":"In vivo acute changes in ATP and glucose concentrations in the testicles of prepubertal rats following unilateral torsion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Low tidal volume ventilation and prone positioning are recommended therapies yet underused in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

ACE is well known to be a key part of the rennin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. The inhibitors of ACE have the potency of treating hypertension. This article reviews the structure-function relationship of ACE as well as its gene polymorphism and inhibitor development. In particular, it has been found that the catalytic mechanisms of the two active sites of somatic ACE in the cleavage of angiotensin I and bradykin are different. Therefore, by specifically targeting the individual active sites of somatic ACE, it will likely offer a new way to develop novel ACE inhibitors with fewer side effects.","output":"Structure and Function of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme and Its Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is undeniable that exposure to outdoor air pollution impacts the health of populations and therefore constitutes a public health problem. Any actions or events causing variations in air quality have repercussions on populations health. Faced with the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis that began at the end of 2019, the governments of several countries were forced, in the beginning of 2020, to put in place very strict containment measures that could have led to changes in air quality. While many works in the literature have studied the issue of changes in the levels of air pollutants during the confinements in different countries, very few have focused on the impact of these changes on health risks. In this work, we compare the 2020 period, which includes two lockdowns (March 16 - May 10 and a partial shutdown Oct. 30 - Dec. 15) to a reference period 2015C2019 to determine how these government-mandated lockdowns affected concentrations of NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10, and how that affected human health factors, including low birth weight, lung cancer, mortality, asthma, non-accidental mortality, respiratory, and cardiovascular illnesses. To this end, we structured 2020 into four periods, alternating phases of freedom and lockdowns characterized by a stringency index. For each period, we calculated (1) the differences in pollutant levels between 2020 and a reference period (2015C2019) at both background and traffic stations (no O3);and (2) the resulting variations in the epidemiological based relative risks of health outcomes. As a result, we found that relative changes in pollutant levels during the 2020 restriction period were as follows: NO2 (?32%), PM2.5 (?22%), PM10 (?15%), and O3 (+10.6%). The pollutants associated with the highest health risk reductions in 2020 were PM2.5 and NO2, while PM10 and O3 changes had almost no effect on health outcomes. Reductions in short-term risks were related to reductions in PM2.5 (?3.2% in child emergency room visits for asthma during the second lockdown) and NO2 (?1.5% in hospitalizations for respiratory causes). Long-term risk reductions related to PM2.5 were low birth weight (?8%), mortality (?3.3%), and lung cancer (?2%), and to NO2 for mortality (?0.96%).

The aim of the study was to examine the disability-inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in four South American Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. METHODS: We conducted documentary research, using framework analysis to analyse reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic, published from February 1st until May 22nd, 2020. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures for the general population). We developed an analytical framework based on recommendations for disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean, the World Health Organisation, and other international organisations. RESULTS: We analysed 72 documents. The findings highlight that while some positive measures were taken, the needs of disabled people were not fully considered. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, without ensuring their translation to practice. All countries took at least some steps to ensure access to financial support, health, and education for disabled people, but at the same time they also implemented policies that had a detrimental impact on disabled people. The populations that are most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19, including disabled people living in institutional care, were protected in several cases only by recommendations rather by legislation. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region - while positive, in several aspects - do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them. In order to ensure response to COVID - 19 is disability inclusive, it is necessary to translate recommendations to practice, consider disabled people both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific measures, and focus on the long-term reconstruction phase.","output":"Disability inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in South America: a framework analysis study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute pediatric poisoning is an emerging health and social problem. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of a large pediatric cohort exposed to xenobiotics, through the analysis of a Pediatric Poison Control Center (PPCc) registry. METHODS: This study, conducted in the Pediatric Hospital Bambino Ges of Rome, a reference National Pediatric Hospital, collected data of children whose parents or caregivers contacted the PPCc by phone (group P), or who presented to the Emergency Department (group ED), during the three-year period 2014C2016. Data were prospectively and systematically collected in a pre-set electronic registry. Comparisons among age groups were performed and multivariable logistic regression models used to investigate associations with outcomes (hospital referral for P, and hospital admission for EDgroup). RESULTS: We collected data of 1611 children on group P and 1075 on group ED. Both groups were exposed to both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical agent exposure increased with age and the most common route of exposure was oral. Only 10% among P group were symptomatic children, with gastrointestinal symptoms. Among the ED patients, 30% were symptomatic children mostly with gastrointestinal (55.4%) and neurologic symptoms (23.8%). Intentional exposure (abuse substance and suicide attempt), which involved 7.7% of patients, was associated with older age and Hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the characteristics of xenobiotics exposures in different paediatric age groups, highlighting the impact of both pharmacological and intentional exposure. Furthermore, our study shows the utility of a specific PPCc, either through Phone support or by direct access to ED.

Here, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays were applied to semen-derived DNA samples, which identified numerous novel DMSs moderately correlated with age. Validation of the ten most age-correlated novel DMSs and three previously known sites in an independent set of semen-derived DNA samples using targeted bisulfite massively parallel sequencing, confirmed age-correlation for nine new and three previously known markers. Prediction modelling revealed the best model for semen, based on 6 CpGs from newly identified genes SH2B2, EXOC3, IFITM2, and GALR2 as well as the previously known FOLH1B gene, which predict age with a mean absolute error of 5.1 years in an independent test set.

This study explores clinical cases where the care of children was perceived to have been negatively impacted as a result of public health measures and changes in healthcare delivery and access due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study used a qualitative multiple case study design with descriptive thematic analysis of clinician-reported consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on care provided at a childrens hospital. A quantitative analysis of overall hospital activity data during the study period was performed. Results The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant change to hospital activity at our tertiary care hospital, including an initial reduction in Emergency Department attendance by 38% and an increase in ambulatory virtual care from 4% before COVID-19, to 67% in August, 2020. Two hundred and twelve clinicians reported a total of 116 unique cases. Themes including (1) timeliness of care, (2) disruption of patient-centered care, (3) new pressures in the provision of safe and efficient care and (4) inequity in the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, each impacting patients, their families and healthcare providers.

Behaviours, such as hand hygiene, screening and cohorting of patients, and the appropriate use of antibiotics have long been recommended in surgery, but their implementation has often been patchy. METHODS: The current crisis presents an opportunity to learn about how to improve infection prevention and control and surveillance (IPCS) behaviours. The improvements made were mainly informal, quick and stemming from the frontline rather than originating from formal organizational structures. The adaptations made and the expertise acquired have the potential for triggering deeper learning and to create enduring improvements in the routine identification and management of infections relating to surgery. RESULTS: This paper aims to illustrate how adopting a human factors and ergonomics perspective can provide insights into how clinical work systems have been adapted and reconfigured in order to keep patients and staff safe. CONCLUSION: For achieving sustainable change in IPCS practices in surgery during COVID-19 and beyond we need to enhance organizational learning potentials.","output":"Will the COVID-19 pandemic transform infection prevention and control in surgery?

Despite its role as an important secretory organelle, a comprehensive compilation of factors associated with WPB has not been carried out. We addressed this via a proximity proteomics approach employing the peroxidase APEX2 coupled with 2 known WPB-associated proteins: the Rab GTPases Rab3b and Rab27a. We show that APEX2-Rab3b/27a fusion constructs are correctly targeted to WPB of primary endothelial cells, and that proteins in their close proximity can be biotinylated through the WPB-recruited APEX2. Mass spectrometry analysis of the biotinylated proteins identified 183 WPB-associated proteins. Whereas these include factors reported before to localize to WPB, the majority comprises proteins not previously associated with WPB biology. Among them, the SNARE-interacting protein Munc13-2 was shown here to specifically localize to WPB and to serve as a novel factor promoting histamine-evoked WPB exocytosis and VWF secretion.

It depicts the strategic and tactical actions of the subsidiary and corporate initiatives during the pandemic, revealing tensions between the subsidiary and its corporate parent on implementation of eachs initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: A case study is presented, based on action research, using internal documents from the company under consideration, participation in various working meetings, meetings with customers and interviews with subsidiary management. Findings: The strategic actions implemented by the subsidiary during the pandemic exemplify strategic agility, i.e. a set of activities carried out by a company that create value in a turbulent and unpredictable environment which in turn require systematic variations in specific processes, products and structures. Some of those variations included the unauthorized amendment of internal corporate rules, leading to tensions between the subsidiary and parent company. This case illustrates that such parent-subsidiary tensions are an inevitable element of achieving agility at the subsidiary level, especially during rapid and unpredictable changes in the business environment. Research limitations/implications: This study presents the flow of events in one multinational corporation subsidiary. However, the authors speculate that similar situations (subsidiary actions exploiting emergent business opportunities and which have been restricted by rigid internal corporate rules and regulations and low receptivity from corporate headquarters) occurred in many multinational corporation subsidiaries, aiming to explore and exploit nascent business opportunities in local markets during the pandemic. Practical implications: The study confirms the necessity for the review of the functioning of the corporate immune system of large multinational corporations to allow more subsidiary initiatives to flourish than before the pandemic.

Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. Regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the DRG microenvironment influences the different regenerative capacities after injury to peripheral or central axons remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptional profiling of mouse DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central axon injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to the three types of injuries. All injuries increased the proportion of a cell type that shares features of both immune cells and glial cells. A distinct subset of satellite glial cells (SGC) appeared specifically in response to peripheral nerve injury. Activation of the PPAR signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury, failed to occur after central axon injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPAR agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single-cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.","output":"Profiling sensory neuron microenvironment after peripheral and central axon injury reveals key pathways for neural repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urodynamics testing forms the cornerstone of investigations when it comes to lower urinary tract dysfunction.

Due to the stacking of convolution layers and the consecutive sampling operations, existing standard models inevitably encounter the information recession problem of feature representations, which fails to fully model the global contextual feature dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel Transformer based medical image semantic segmentation framework called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip connection are jointly designed to effectively enhance the functionality and flexibility of traditional U-shaped architecture. Inspired by Transformer, a novel self-aware attention (SAA) module with both Transformer Self Attention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions between encoder features. In particular, we also establish additional multi-scale skip connections between decoder blocks to aggregate the different semantic-scale upsampling features. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate the loss of fine details caused by the information recession problem, improving the diagnostic sensitivity and segmentation quality of medical image analysis. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets of different imaging demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.","output":"TransAttUnet: Multi-level Attention-guided U-Net with Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 was initially identified as an infection of the lower respiratory tract but has so far manifested itself with very different symptoms.

We found that although the blood glucose was not obviously reduced by these two SMF settings, both of the glycated serum protein (GSP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased (Cohen's d = 2.57-3.04). Moreover, the wound healing, liver lipid accumulation, and renal defects were all significantly improved by SMF treatment (Cohen's d = 0.91-2.05).

We aimed to investigate the association between the presence of NAFLD and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19-related outcomes. METHODS: We used the population-based, nationwide cohort in South Korea linked with the general health examination records between January 1, 2018 and July 30, 2020. Data for 212,768 adults older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing from January 1 to May 30, 2020, were obtained. The presence of NAFLDs was defined using three definitions, namely hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty liver index (FLI), and claims-based definition. The outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 test positive, COVID-19 severe illness, and related death. RESULTS: Among 74,244 adults who completed the general health examination, there were 2,251 (3.0%) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 438 (0.6%) with severe COVID-19 illness, and 45 (0.06%) COVID-19-related deaths. After exposure-driven propensity score matching, patients with pre-existing HSI-NAFLD, FLI-NAFLD, or claims-based NAFLD had an 11C23% increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HSI-NAFLD 95% confidence interval [CI], 1C28%; FLI-NAFLD 95% CI, 2C27%; and claims-based NAFLD 95% CI, 2C31%) and a 35C41% increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (HSI-NAFLD 95% CI, 8C83%; FLI-NAFLD 95% CI, 5C71%; and claims-based NAFLD 95% CI, 1C92%). These associations are more evident as liver fibrosis advanced (based on the BARD scoring system). Similar patterns were observed in several sensitivity analyses including the full-unmatched cohort. CONCLUSION: Patients with pre-existing NAFLDs have a higher likelihood of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive and severe COVID-19 illness; this association was more evident in patients with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis.

TWH were randomized to the PN intervention (n = 75) or control (n = 38) condition. Control participants were referred to trans-friendly HIV care. Intervention participants were assigned a navigator who conducted nine in-person one-on-one sessions and bi-weekly phone or text check-ins to help participants overcome barriers to care and work towards gender affirmation and healthcare goals. We followed participants for 9 months to determine intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in improving retention in care. Analyses were intention to treat (ITT). Intervention acceptability was high: at end line, 85.2% of PN participants said they would continue receiving services and 94.4% would recommend peer navigation to a friend. A priori feasibility criteria were met: 92% of eligible participants enrolled and 70% were retained at 9 months; however, only 47% achieved moderate or better adherence to both in-person and phone/text program components. Though the pilot was not powered for efficacy, ITT findings trended toward significance, with intervention participants 40% more likely to be retained in care at the end of the study.

The evidence around the application of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is still provisional, and further investigations are needed to confirm its eventual beneficial effects. AIMS: To assess the effect of TPE on the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, using three statistical procedures to rule out any threats to validity. METHODS: We therefore carried out a single-centered retrospective observational non-placebo-controlled trial enrolling 73 inpatients from Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran (Iran) with the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs and high-resolution computerized tomography chest scan. These patients were broken down into two groups: Group 1 (30 patients) receiving standard care (corticosteroids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, pantoprazole, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir), and Group 2 (43 patients) receiving the above regimen plus TPE (replacing 2 l of patients' plasma by a solution, 50% of normal plasma, and 50% of albumin at 5%) administered according to various time schedules. The follow-up time was 30 days and all-cause mortality was the endpoint. RESULTS: Deaths were 6 (14%) in Group 2 and 14 (47%) in Group 1. However, different harmful risk factors prevailed among patients not receiving TPE rather than being equally split between the intervention and control group. We used an algorithm of structural equation modeling (of STATA) to summarize a large pool of potential confounders into a single score (called with the descriptive name severity). Disease severity was lower (Wilkinson rank-sum test p < 0.001) among patients with COVID-19 undergoing TPE (median: ?2.82; range: ?5.18; 7.96) as compared to those not receiving TPE (median: ?1.35; range: ?3.89; 8.84), confirming that treatment assignment involved a selection bias of patients according to the severity of COVID-19 at hospital admission. The adjustment for confounding was carried out using severity as the covariate in Cox regression models. The univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (95%CI: 0.26; 1.80; p = 0.441) for TPE turned to 1.19 (95%CI: 0.43; 3.29; p = 0.741) after adjusting for severity. CONCLUSIONS: In this study sample, the lower mortality observed among patients receiving TPE was due to a lower severity of COVID-19 rather than the TPE effects.","output":"On Therapeutic Plasma Exchange Against Severe COVID-19-Associated Pneumonia: An Observational Clinical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been an increase in human health concerns, and seaweeds are considered as a potential functional food which can decrease the risk of many diseases, as they contain various bioactive compounds.

These assumptions are often challenged when unexpected changes in demand occur, such as the spatial and temporal changes observed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Social distancing policies (SDPs) enacted led many universities to close their campuses and implement remote learning, impacting utility consumption patterns. Yet, little is known about how consumption changed at the building level. Here, we aim to understand how water and electricity consumption changed during the pandemic by identifying characteristic weekly demand profiles and understanding how these changes were related to regulatory and social systems. We performed k-means clustering on utility demand data measured before and as the pandemic evolved from five buildings of different types at the University of Texas at Austin. As expected, after SDPs were enacted both water and electricity use shifted, with most buildings seeing a sharp initial decline that remained low until the university partially reopened. In contrast to electricity use, we found that water use was tightly coupled with SDPs.

Objective: The purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of 1,25VitD3 on IL-25 and related cytokines of Th17 cells including IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-23 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy women as a control group and women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion. Method: Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed from peripheral blood of the subjects of the studied groups (20 women with URSA as a case group, and 20 control women). The effects of 1,25VitD3 (50 nM, for 24 h) on the studied parameters were evaluated and were compared to the positive and negative controls in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the percentages of regulatory T cells and Th17 cells. For gene expression measurement and cytokines assay, real-time PCR and ELISA were carried out. Results: The proportion of Th17 cells in women with URSA was considerably higher than in the control group. IL-25 mRNA and protein levels in cultured PBMCs from women with URSA were lower than the controls. 1,25VitD3 increased IL-25 expressions at both the protein and mRNA levels in PBMCs from women with URSA relative to the control group. Additionally, 1,25VitD3 treatment not only significantly decreased the percentage of Th17 cells frequency but also reduced expressions of IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-23 in PBMCs from women with URSA. Conclusion: 1,25VitD3 may diminish inflammatory responses cells via downregulation of IL-25 expression.

Only the executive has the information, decisiveness, and speed to respond to crises, and so the executive is not capable of being effectively constrained by other branches. Ordinary checks and balances, then, are believed to effectively disappear during a crisis. Referring to the classic theorist of emergency rule, conventional accounts describe crisis governance as \\"Schmittian\\" and \\"post-Madisonian,\\" characterized by an unbound executive that faces few, if any, legal constraints. This article interrogates these propositions using evidence from how countries responded to the 2020 global pandemic during the critical first few months. It presents data from an original and global survey of over one hundred countries to evaluate the nature of emergency powers during the pandemic. This article finds that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, courts, legislatures, and subnational governments have played important roles in constraining national executives. Courts have insisted on procedural integrity of invocations of emergency, engaged in substantive review of rights restrictions, and in some cases demanded that government take affirmative steps to combat the COVID-19 virus and its effects. Legislatures have played a role in providing oversight and, in many cases, in producing new legislation that responds to the current crisis. Subnational governments, too, have pushed back against central authorities, engaging in valuable checks and balances that shaped the response. Taken together, these findings suggest that, during COVID, emergency governance has been closer to the Madisonian ideal of strong checks and balances than to Schmittian accounts of an unbound executive. This article considers the implications of these findings for theories of emergency governance, arguing that the conventional theories are based on one particular type of crisis-a national security crisis-and therefore their insights may be ill-suited to other kinds of emergencies, such as a pandemic.","output":"The bound executive: Emergency powers during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A partial characterization of the ion channels formed by the SARS coronavirus (CoV) envelope (E) protein was previously reported [C.

First, reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allows the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid. The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residues candidates for titration. Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments. Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein-lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids.

The specific uPA inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2, SerpinB2) specifically targets cell bound uPA and is internalised. Furthermore, preclinical studies have established the \\"proof-of-principle\\" of uPA-targeting by PAI-2-cytotoxin conjugates in human carcinoma models. However, these studies also suggest that PAI-2 is rapidly cleared via the renal system with low total dose reaching the tumour. In this study, a comparative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and biodistribution (BD) analysis of different forms of PAI-2 labelled with the radioisotopes iodine-123 ((123)I) and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) was undertaken. METHODS The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and BD of wild-type, CD-loop and PEGylated CD-loop PAI-2 labelled with the commonly used diagnostic SPECT radioisotopes (99m)Tc or (123)I were compared in mouse models of human prostate carcinoma. Whole body SPECT imaging was also performed. RESULTS Both wild-type and the shorter but active CD-loop form of PAI-2 (123)I-labelled indirectly via conjugation to free amine groups (termed (123)I-Bn-PAI-2) exhibited low tumour uptake, rapid excretion and similar PK profiles. Preliminary studies with a short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 CD-loop indicated an increase in blood retention time and tumour uptake. All (123)I-Bn-labelled radiotracers were largely excreted through the kidneys. By comparison, both wild-type (123)I-PAI-2 (labelled directly via tyrosine residues) and (99m)Tc-PAI-2 displayed different PK/BD patterns compared to (123)I-Bn-PAI-2, suggesting greater liver based catabolism and thus slower elimination. SPECT imaging mimicked the BD results of all radiotracers. CONCLUSION The different labelling methods gave distinct PAI-2 BD and tumour uptake profiles, with radioiodination resulting in the best non-tumour organ clearance profiles. Preliminary analyses with short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 CD-loop suggest that further investigations with other PEGylation reagents are required to optimise this approach for tumour imaging.

Despite many studies predicting the likelihood of bacteremia in CAP patients, those results have been rarely implemented in clinical practice, and use of blood culture in CAP is still increasing. This study evaluated impact of implementing a previously derived and validated bacteremia prediction rule. METHODS: In this registry-based before and after study, we used piecewise regression analysis to compare the blood culture rate before and after implementation of the prediction rule. We also compared 30-day mortality, emergency department (ED) length of stay, time-interval to initial antibiotics after ED arrival, and any changes to the antibiotics regimen as results of the blood cultures. In subgroup analysis, we compared two groups (with or without the use of the prediction rule) after implementation period, using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Following the implementation, the blood culture rate declined from 85.5% to 78.1% (P = 0.003) without significant changes in 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen.

Its consequences were the implementation of national measures such as the containment of the population, but also a disorganization of the healthcare system, in particular concerning oral care. Indeed, dental procedures produce aerosols which can be loaded with viral particles, and as such, constitute a major contamination route by the virus. At the request of the Conference of Deans of the Faculties of Odontology, the National College of University Dentists in Public Health (CNCDUSP) set up a working group in order to issue recommendations for oral care in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, given the specific risks faced by practitioners. Considering the lack of awareness of the specifics of dentistry in the medical world and among decision-makers, and given the speed with which national measures to fight the epidemic were implemented, the recommendations of the CNCDUSP had to be drawn up rigorously and quickly before being released to the profession.

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions. METHODS: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1-3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70% of people) and inability to socially distance (68% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48% (33%-60%) to 66% (44%-71%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6% gross domestic product (0.1% Pakistan-1.1% Chile). CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. Social protection is likely to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they are most likely to suffer income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.","output":"Exploring equity in health and poverty impacts of control measures for SARS-CoV-2 in six countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supply chains have been facing many disruptions due to natural and man-made disasters.

We semi-quantitatively measured anti-S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first dose of AZD1222 or BNT162b2, and 2 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2. We evaluated the association between the maximum grade of local or systemic adverse events and the anti-S1 IgG optical density using multivariate linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, and use of antipyretics.

Vascular access (VA) for haemodalysis (HD) is considered the patients lifeline and its maintenance is essential for the continuation of a life saving treatment. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of VA for dialysis was already constrained. Throughout the pandemic, inevitably, many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not received timely intervention for VA care. This could have a detrimental impact on dialysis patient outcomes in the near future and needs to be addressed urgently. Many societies have issued prioritisation to allow rationing based on clinical risk, mainly according to estimated urgency and need for treatment. The recommendations recently proposed by the European and American Vascular Societies in the COVID-19 pandemic era regarding the triage of various vascular operations into urgent, emergent and elective are debatable. VA creation and interventions maintain the lifeline of complex HD patients, and the indication for surgery and other interventions warrants patient-specific clinical judgement and pathways. Keeping the use of central venous catheters at a minimum, with the goal of creating the right access, in the right patient, at the right time, and for the right reasons, is mandatory. These strategies may require local modifications. Risk assessments may need specific renal pathways to be developed rather than applying standard surgical risk stratification. In conclusion, in order to recover from the second wave of COVID-19 and prepare for further phases, the provision of the best dialysis access, including peritoneal dialysis, will require working closely with the multidisciplinary team involved in the assessment, creation, cannulation, surveillance, maintenance, and salvage of definitive access.","output":"A call to optimize haemodialysis vascular access care in healthcare disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented crisis in the care of non-Covid patients all across the globe and care for lung cancer patients is no exception Lung Cancer patients are at increased risks of COVID due to increased mortality from dual aggressive pathology in the lungs Our aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer therapy and factors responsible delay in optimal care during the pandemic Methods: This study included all patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer being treated at our Institute, a tertiary level referral hospital in eastern part of India during on going pandemic Seven developed COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR method (Table 1) Results: The mean age of the patients was 49 years All the patients had metastatic lung cancer All males had history of smoking Hypertension was present in only one patient Four patients (57%) died from concomitant COVID-19 at our institution Three patients who recovered from COVID were stable One of them (positive for ROS1) was switched over to Crizotinib and other patient resumed chemotherapy only after he had recovered from COVID-19 Most of the patients acquired COVID-19 infection during the process of evaluatio/chemotherapy and that further delayed the treatment [Formula presented] Conclusion: The results were disappointing because more than half of lung cancer patients died due to COVID-19 The disease course of COVID-19 has been more severe in patients with lung cancers with Chemotherapy There have been delay in resuming treatment among survivors by few weeks Fear of aggressiveness of disease was the key factor for interruption or delay in chemotherapy Other variable factors like stage of cancer, palliative intent of chemotherapy, ECOG status were key determinants for interruption of treatment The decision to temporarily suspend chemotherapy while waiting for recovery from SARS-CoV-2 and then restart, was not easy due to the risk of cancer progression The findings amplify the importance of optimizing of lung cancer care in the context of the COVID-19 prevalence The decisions need to be taken on the basis of individual cases rather than rely on a generalized approach In resource limited country like India diverting the existing resources to an emergency leads to compromise of routine outpatient care, especially patients with chronic illness We need to be flexible in restarting of services guided by local COVID prevalence, while awaiting a definite management plan for COVID-19 Keywords: lung cancer, India, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2","output":"P09.48 Experience and Outcome of COVID-19-Positive Lung Cancer Patients from a Eastern Indian Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T-cells expressing the RT6 surface alloantigen appear to perform important immunoregulatory functions in the rat.

Transfusions leading to engraftment of RT6+ T-cells prevent both diabetes and thyroiditis in the diabetes-prone rat. To investigate the absence of this subset in the lymphopenic BB rat, we used both molecular and biochemical procedures and made the following observations: 1) an mRNA encoding RT6 protein is present in diabetes-prone spleen cells; 2) nucleotide sequencing of this transcript reveals an intact coding sequence for the RT6.1 alloantigen; 3) sensitive chemiluminescent assay of diabetes-prone lymph node cell detergent extracts shows that diabetes-prone RT6 mRNA is translated in vivo; 4) quantitatively, diabetes-prone lymph node cells express < or = 10% of the RT6.1 protein found on similar numbers of diabetes-resistant BB cells; and 5) finally, we obtained evidence of an intact phosphatidylinositol linkage of the molecule to the cell surface and successfully immunoprecipitated the phosphatidylinositol-linked protein with DS4.23 monoclonal antibody, indicating that the RT6.1 antigen is correctly processed and folded in diabetes-prone lymph node cells.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Spongiform encephalopathy has always occurred sporadically in man and other animals. Hippocrates may have described it in goats and cattle. Transmission of spongiform encephalopathy between individuals is too uncommon for it to be usefully considered an infection. Spongiform encephalopathy is a somatic disorder whose dissemination within a host or transmission between individuals is more like cancer than infectious disease. Spongiform encephalopathy transmission within a species is facilitated in comparison to transmission between species so that cannibalism may amplify the prevalence of the disease.

Enteroviruses and adenoviruses are the most common etiologic agents. Viral myocarditis is a triphasic process. Phase 1 is the period of active viral replication in the myocardium during which the symptoms of myocardial damage range from none to cardiogenic shock. If the disease process continues, it enters phase 2, which is characterized by autoimmunity triggered by viral and myocardial proteins. Heart failure often appears for the first time in phase 2. Phase 3, dilated cardiomyopathy, is the end result in some patients. Diagnostic procedures and treatment should be tailored to the phase of disease. Viral myocarditis is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as proved by the frequent presence of viral genomic material in the myocardium, and by improvement in ventricular function by immunomodulatory therapy. Myocarditis of any etiology usually presents with heart failure, but the second most common presentation is ventricular arrhythmia. As a result, myocarditis is one of the most common causes of sudden death in young people and others without preexisting structural heart disease. Myocarditis can be definitively diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. However, it is clear that existing criteria for the histologic diagnosis need to be refined, and that a variety of molecular markers in the myocardium and the circulation can be used to establish the diagnosis. Treatment of myocarditis has been generally disappointing. Accurate staging of the disease will undoubtedly improve treatment in the future. It is clear that immunosuppression and immunomodulation are effective in some patients, especially during phase 2, but may not be as useful in phases 1 and 3. Since myocarditis is often selflimited, bridging and recovery therapy with circulatory assistance may be effective. Prevention by immunization or receptor blocking strategies is under development. Giant cell myocarditis is an unusually fulminant form of the disease that progresses rapidly to heart failure or sudden death. Rapid onset of disease in young people, especially those with other autoimmune manifestations, accompanied by heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias, suggests giant cell myocarditis.

Electronic patient records were used to identify patients, clinical data, and outcomes. Procalcitonin (PCT) serum assays, where available on admission, were analysed against electronic prescribing records for antibacterial prescribing to determine relationships with a negative PCT result (<0.25mg/L) and antibacterial course length. Results: Antibacterial agents were initiated on admission in 310/624 (49.7%) of patients presenting with COVID-19. 33/74 (44.5%) patients with a negative PCT on admission had their treatment stopped within 24 hours. 6/49 (12.2%) patients who had antibacterials started but a positive PCT had their treatment stopped.

Identification of individuals with tuberculosis and prompt initiation of effective treatment to rapidly render them non-infectious is crucial to this task. However, in settings of high tuberculosis burden, active case-finding is often not implemented, resulting in long delays in diagnosis and treatment. A range of strategies to find cases and ensure prompt and correct treatment have been shown to be effective in high tuberculosis-burden settings. The population-level effect of targeted active case-finding on reducing tuberculosis incidence has been shown by studies and projected by mathematical modelling. The inclusion of targeted active case-finding in a comprehensive epidemic-control strategy for tuberculosis should contribute substantially to a decrease in tuberculosis incidence.","output":"Turning off the tap: stopping tuberculosis transmission through active case-finding and prompt effective treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have developed the system to measure the effectiveness of influencer marketing by a general-purpose method using web browsers and web servers.

METHOD: The study was based on the measurement of cognitive functions of 19 spirits mediums through neuropsychological tests such as the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB), the Verbal Fluency Test (FAS), the digit span test, the cube test, the five digit test (FDT) and an evaluation of mental health through scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ), and the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ). The sample included the participation of spirit mediums divided into two groups. The more experienced group (MEG) with 11 subjects had more than 10 years of mediumistic practice, while the other less experienced group (LEG) with 8 subjects had 1C5 years of experience. The inclusion criteria were psychophonic mediums (who have the ability to communication when deceased beings communicate directly via speaking) with regular trance practices for at least one year. The data collected were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package. RESULTS: Regarding performance on the BCSB and digit span test, all subjects reached scores at the median or higher in comparison to standardized scores of Brazilians. Scores of 90% on the cube test and 42% on the FAS were reached in comparison to median or higher values, versus the median of standardized scores among Brazilians. On the FDT, we found statistical significance (p = 0.038) in the choice stage, with higher performance of subjects whose initial age of trance recognition occurred before 21 years old. On the BDI scale, no participant met the criteria for major depression. The SRQ showed an incidence of common mental disorders in 21% of the sample, which was more prevalent in the LEG (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The cognitive functioning of subjects who practice trance mediumship in Brazil is associated with cognitive health. Executive dysfunction may be a tendency in LEG. However, an incidence of common mental disorders in the LEG was observed.

Larvae of Aedes aegypti (New Orleans strain) were screened with the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pandemic Response Box, an open-source compound library, using INVAPP, an invertebrate automated phenotyping platform suited to high-throughput chemical screening of larval motility. Of the 400 compounds screened, we identified rubitecan (a synthetic derivative of camptothecin) as a hit compound that significantly reduced Ae. aegypti larval motility compared to DMSO controls. Both rubitecan and camptothecin displayed concentration dependent reduction in larval motility with estimated EC50s of 25.5  5.0 M and 22.3  5.4 M respectively. We extended our investigation to adult mosquitoes and found that camptothecin increased lethality when delivered in a blood meal to Ae. aegypti adults at 100 M and 10 M and completely blocked egg laying when fed at 100 M. Camptothecin and its derivatives, inhibitors of topoisomerase I, have known activity against several agricultural pests and are also approved for the treatment of several cancers. Crucially, they can inhibit Zika virus replication in human cells, so there is potential for dual targeting of both the vector and an important arbovirus that it carries.

Although all clinical interactions likely carry some risk of transmission, human actions like coughing and care activities like aerosol-generating procedures likely have a higher risk of transmission. The rapid emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 continues to create significant challenges in healthcare facilities, particularly with shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by HCP. Evidence-based recommendations for what PPE to use in conventional, contingency, and crisis standards of care continue to be needed. Where evidence is lacking, the development of specific research questions can help direct funders and investigators. OBJECTIVE: Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support HCP in their decisions about infection prevention when caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. METHODS: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel including frontline clinicians, infectious disease specialists, experts in infection control, and guideline methodologists with representation from the disciplines of public health, medical microbiology, pediatrics, critical care medicine and gastroenterology. The process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on eight recommendations, including two updated recommendations and one new recommendation added since the first version of the guideline. Narrative summaries of other interventions undergoing evaluations are also included. CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of direct and indirect evidence, the panel was able to provide recommendations for eight specific questions on the use of PPE for HCP providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. Where evidence was lacking, attempts were made to provide potential avenues for investigation. There remain significant gaps in the understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and PPE recommendations may need to be modified in response to new evidence. These recommendations should serve as a minimum for PPE use in healthcare facilities and do not preclude decisions based on local risk assessments or requirements of local health jurisdictions or other regulatory bodies.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on Infection Prevention for Healthcare Personnel Caring for Patients with Suspected or Known COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the requirements to improve routine health information systems (RHISs) for the management of health systems, including the identification of best practices, opportunities, and challenges in the 53 countries and territories of the WHO European region.

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.

Besides pneumonia and acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other features became evident in the context of COVID-19. These includes endothelial and coagulation dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), along with the occurrence of neurological alterations. The multi-system nature of such viral infection is a witness to the exploitation and impairment of ubiquitous subcellular and metabolic pathways for the sake of its life-cycle, ranging from host cell invasion, replication, transmission, up to a cytopathic effect and overt systemic inflammation. In this frame, alterations in cell-clearing systems of the host are emerging as a hallmark in the pathogenesis of various respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, exploitation of the autophagy and proteasome pathways might contribute not only to the replication of the virus at the site of infection but also to the spreading of either mature virions or inflammatory mediators at both cellular and multisystem levels. In this frame, besides a pharmacological therapy, many researchers are wondering if some non-pharmacological substances might counteract or positively modulate the course of the infection. The pharmacological properties of natural compounds have gained increasing attention in the field of alternative and adjunct therapeutic approaches to several diseases. In particular, several naturally-occurring herbal compounds (mostly polyphenols) are reported to produce widespread antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects while acting as autophagy and (immuno)-proteasome modulators.

This paper attempts to examine the possible effects of COVID-19 on Australia's demography over the next two decades, focusing in particular on population ageing. Several population projections were prepared for the period 2019-41. We formulated three scenarios in which the pandemic has a short-lived impact of 2-3 years, a moderate impact lasting about 5 years, or a severe impact lasting up to a decade. We also created two hypothetical scenarios, one of which illustrates Australia's demographic future in the absence of a pandemic for comparative purposes, and another which demonstrates the demographic consequences if Australia had experienced excess mortality equivalent to that recorded in the first half of 2020 in England & Wales. Our projections show that the pandemic will probably have little impact on numerical population ageing but a moderate effect on structural ageing. Had Australia experienced the high mortality observed in England & Wales there would have been 19,400 excess deaths. We caution that considerable uncertainty surrounds the future trajectory of COVID-19 and therefore the demographic responses to it.

Viral surface proteins bind to specific receptors on the cellular membrane of host cells and begin therewith the infection process. During pregnancy, the molecular features of these proteins may determine specific target cells in the placenta, which may explain the different outcomes. In this review, we display information on Variola, Influenza, Zika and Corona viruses focused on their surface proteins, effects on pregnancy, and possible target placental cells.

The non-carcinogenic health risk assessment proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) suggested the mean hazard indices (HIs) were below one which denotes no significant of non-carcinogenic risks to both children and adults. Furthermore, carcinogenic risk assessment results advised ~80% of cancer risk was caused by Cr contents, while other heavy metals indicate that neither children nor adults in the study region were of carcinogenic risks.","output":"Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) pollution in surface soils in a typical urban region of south India: An application of health risk assessment and distribution pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic, including Indonesia. However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects' overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40-49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20-29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease. A geographical difference was also observed: a higher prevalence in Surabaya (13.1%) than in Jombang (9.9%). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak among asymptomatic populations was characterized by a high prevalence of infection in East Java, Indonesia.","output":"Seroepidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In stable craniovertebral injuries complicated by polytrauma, rigorous spinal immobilization is essential for neuroprotection. Scalp and forehead reconstruction in these circumstances are safest when performed under local anesthesia, maintaining cervical immobilization. Case Description A sizeable 10  6.5 cm forehead defect was reconstructed utilizing regenerative principles under local anesthesia and sedation in a 54-year-old woman. After adequate debridement of gangrenous soft tissues, exposed outer skull bones were trephined, forehead defect covered with a synthetic biomaterial, and the patient was discharged thereafter. Granulating neodermis regenerated within the biomaterial over the next 6 weeks. Weekly platelet-rich plasma injections along the wound margins facilitated wound regeneration. Dimensions reduced by two-thirds to 6.5  3.5 cm with wound regeneration and contraction, while granulating neodermis covered the remaining skull-bones. Split skin-grafting over the neodermis ensured satisfying long-term results, with similar color, texture, soft-tissue thickness, and sensation. Multiple occipitocervical, spinal, scapular, and rib fractures healed well with strict immobilization. Conclusion Good long-term results were achieved with significantly reduced dangers, complications, hospitalization, and costs than traditional reconstructive flap surgeries. Minimalistic reconstruction utilizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine principles appears beneficial for patients with grave spinal injuries.","output":"Minimalistic reconstruction of exposed skull in a complex craniovertebral polytrauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The public are increasingly reliant on the internet and media to access healthcare related information during the Covid-19 pandemic. Vitamin D is essential for musculoskeletal and immune health, with daily supplementation advised by public health bodies. Several studies assessing a possible link between vitamin D and Covid-19 severity have arrived at conflicting results and news articles have been rapidly disseminating such research to the public. There has been little focus on studying the quality of information available. Aim: To identify if online search interest in vitamin D increased with pandemic burden and analyse the accuracy of public health messaging relating to vitamin D in online news articles. Methods: Online search interest data for vitamin D was correlated with pandemic burden, defined as the number of Covid-19 deaths. Online news articles discussing vitamin D and Covid-19 were analysed using qualitative coding. Results: Online search interest for vitamin D increased as pandemic burden increased (p < 0.0001, Spearman's rank). Of the 72 articles identified, most (50%) offered a mixed opinion on the benefit of vitamin D in Covid-19. From articles making a recommendation for vitamin D supplementation, 23% of articles gave mixed messaging or advised against supplementation. 16% of articles recommended a dose which exceeded the safe limit of 4000 IU/day, risking toxicity. Conclusion: A significant number of articles provided mixed messaging or incorrectly advised supratherapeutic doses. This study highlights an opportunity for public health bodies to utilise the increased interest in vitamin D during the pandemic to raise awareness with accurate information.","output":"Vitamin D in the news: A call for clear public health messaging during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (K-A-P) about food safety and nutrition in Chinese adults who were recruited to the online survey during the epidemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Design Participants were recruited by an online snowball sampling method. An electronic questionnaire was sent to our colleagues, students, friends, other professionals, and their referrals helped us recruit more participants. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information, the attention paid to COVID-19, K-A-P about food safety and nutrition. Multiple and logistic regression analysis were used to explore related factors of K-A-P.Subjects Totally 2272 participants aged 24.099.14 years, from 27 provinces, autonomous districts or municipalities, with 18.3% male, and 83.4% with a medical background.Results The total possible knowledge score was 8.0, the average score was 5.2  1.6, and 4.2% obtained 8.0. The total possible attitudes score was 8.0, the average score was 6.5  1.4, and 36.1% obtained 8.0. The total possible food safety practices score was 5.0, the average score was 3.7  1.0, and 20.7% obtained 5.0.

Growing evidences that overweight and obesity which extent nearly a third of the world population were associated with severe COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the association and risk of increased BMI and obesity with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of ICU admission, ARDS, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, and mortality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in meta-analysis with 9 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 10 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (cut-off 30 kg/m(2)). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 1.12 (95% CI, 0.67C1.57, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, obesity was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95% CI, 1.25C2.54, P < 0.001) Multivariate meta-regression showed the association between BMI and obesity on composite poor outcome were affected by age, gender, DM type 2, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should always be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.","output":"Effect of increased BMI and obesity on the outcome of COVID-19 adult patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teaching the history of epidemics remains a critical mission of our profession, both inside and outside of the classroom.

Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which rapidly disappeared in less than one year, MERS has persisted for over three years. More than 1,600 cases of MERS have been reported worldwide, and the disease carries a worryingly high fatality rate of >30%. A total of 182 MERS-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 94 from humans and 88 from dromedary camels. The 182 genomes all share >99% identity, indicating minimal variation among MERS-CoV genomes. MERS-CoV is a lineage C Betacoronavirus (?CoV). MERS-CoV genomes can be roughly divided into two clades: clade A, which contains only a few strains, and clade B, to which most strains belong. In contrast to ORF1ab and structural proteins, the putative proteins encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b in the MERS-CoV genome do not share homology with any known host or virus protein, other than those of its closely related lineage C ?CoVs. Human and dromedary viral genomes have intermingled, indicating that multiple camel-to-human transmission events have occurred. The multiple origins of MERS-CoV suggest that the virus has been resident in dromedaries for many years. This is consistent with the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as the 1980s.","output":"Genomics and zoonotic infections: Middle East respiratory syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online classes have been provided for health-care pre-licensure learners during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of online group work in interprofessional education. A total of 209 students were assigned to 50 groups (18 medical student groups, 13 nursing student groups, and 19 mixed medical/nursing student groups). Learners performed group work during the orientation for the course, which was hosted using an online video conferencing system. The learners first performed the activity individually (10 min) and then engaged in a group discussion to reach consensus on their answers (30 min). We calculated the scores before and after the group discussion and shared the results with the students. Scores were improved after the group discussion (mean  SEM, 23.7  0.9) compared with before (37.3  1.3) (P < .0001). Lower scores after the group discussion, which indicated the effect of the group discussion on making better decisions, were observed most in the mixed medical/nursing student groups, followed by the nursing student and medical student groups. We noted only 3 groups in which the group discussion showed a negative effect on decision-making: all 3 of these groups were mixed (3 of 19 groups; 16%). These data demonstrated the power of group discussion for solving tasks when the participants professional fields were mixed. However, the small size of the interdisciplinary groups might have resulted in less effective discussion, which might be due in part to psychological barriers arising from professional differences. Online group work is effective for facilitating discussion and building consensus about decisions in interprofessional education for medical and nursing students. Potential psychological barriers may exist in about 16% of mixed group students at the start, which should be kept in mind by instructors.

Given the threat of reintroduction of the virus into domestic herds, a rapid, reliable, easily implemented assay is needed for detection of PRV. Although a real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay exists, improvements in rtPCR technology and a greater understanding of the diversity of PRV strains worldwide require an assay that would be easier to implement, more cost effective, and more specific. We developed a single-tube, rapid rtPCR that is capable of detecting 10 copies of PRV glycoprotein B ( gB) DNA per 20-L total volume reaction. The assay did not produce a false-positive in samples known to be negative for the virus. The assay was negative for genetically similar herpesviruses and other porcine viruses. Our assay is a highly specific and sensitive assay that is also highly repeatable and reproducible. The assay should be a useful tool for early detection of PRV in pigs in the case of a suspected introduction or outbreak situation.","output":"Development of a rapid, simple, and specific real-time PCR assay for detection of pseudorabies viral DNA in domestic swine herds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two candidate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike gene were designed and in vitro transcribed to explore the possibility of silencing SARS-CoV S gene.

At various time points of posttransfection, the levels of S-EGFP expression and amounts of spike mRNA transcript were detected by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, Western blot, and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. The results showed that the cells transfected with pEGFP-optS expressed S-EGFP fusion protein at a higher level compared with those transfected with pEGFP-S, which contains wildtype SARS-CoV spike gene sequence. The green fluorescence, mean fluorescence intensity, and SARS-CoV S RNA transcripts were found significantly reduced, and the expression of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was strongly inhibited in those cells co-transfected with either EGFP- or S-specific siRNAs. Our findings demonstrated that the S-specific siRNAs used in this study were able to specifically and effectively inhibit SARS-CoV S glycoprotein expression in cultured cells through blocking the accumulation of S mRNA, which may provide an approach for studies on the functions of SARS-CoV S gene and development of novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV.","output":"Silencing of SARS-CoV spike gene by small interfering RNA in HEK 293T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immeasurable impact, affecting healthcare systems, the global economy, and society. Exploration of trends within the existing COVID-19 data may guide directions for further study and novel treatment development. As the world faces COVID-19 disease, it is essential to study its epidemiological and clinical characteristics further to better understand and aid in its detection and containment. METHODS: We aimed to study the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Dubai, a multi-national Society. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, age, gender, and country of origin were associated with more severe cases of COVID-19, higher risk for hospitalization and death. Male individuals between 41 and 60 years of age from India had the most significant hospitalization and death predictor (p=.0001). The predictors for COVID-19 related deaths were slightly less than UAE Nationals by individuals from GCC (p=.02) that were followed closely behind by Pilipino (p=.02) and Arabs (p=.001). CONCLUSION: The vulnerability of individuals to infection and in the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms remains to be understood. There are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in responding to the virus.
