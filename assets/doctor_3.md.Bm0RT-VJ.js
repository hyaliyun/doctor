The role of civilCmilitary cooperation in a health crisis of the magnitude presented by COVID-19 remains virtually unexplored. This review aims to detect and identify typologies, if any, of associations between security or military systems and the national response measures during the COVID-19, as adopted by six European countries during the early phase of the outbreak (January to March 2020). METHODS: We designed a structured qualitative literature review (qualitative evidence synthesis), primarily targeting open-source grey literature using a customised Google web search. Our target countries were UK, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Sweden. We employed a best fit framework synthesis approach in qualitative analysis of the result records. RESULTS: A total of 277 result records were included in our qualitative synthesis, with an overall search relevance yield of 46%. We identified 19 distinct descriptive categories of civilCmilitary cooperation extending across seven analytical themes. Most prominent themes included how military support was incorporated in the national COVID-19 response, including support to national health systems, military repatriation and evacuation, and support to wider public systems. CONCLUSION: Findings of this review show the significance of military systems in supporting an expansive response during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our proposed methodological approach for capturing military health data in a reproducible manner and providing a comparative view on common types of interventions provided by civilCmilitary cooperation to inform lessons from the use of military capacities during current COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"CivilCmilitary cooperation in the early response to the COVID-19 pandemic in six European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has caused high number of infections and deaths of healthcare workers globally.

Data regarding microbiological and molecular characteristics of such infections in COVID-19 patients are scarce. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis, including species identification, antifungal susceptibility testing, molecular resistance determinants analysis, typing, and retrospective clinical data review, of fungal isolates recovered from 19 COVID-19 patients, who were hospitalized at the Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) in Hackensack, New Jersey, USA, in the initial phase of the pandemic from AprilCMay 2020. In total, 17 Candida albicans, two C. parapsilosis, and two Aspergillus fumigatus were analyzed. All Candida spp. isolates were susceptible to micafungin and azole drugs (fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole). A. fumigatus isolates were susceptible to micafungin and all triazole drugs except fluconazole (intrinsic resistance). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of C. albicans isolates revealed 15 different sequence types (STs), which clustered below the clade-defining limit of p-distance < 0.04. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) karyotyping revealed no chromosomal rearrangements in these isolates. A. fumigatus isolates were of different, non-related genotypes. We speculate that virus- and drug-induced immunosuppression (94.7% of the patients received corticosteroids), together with prolonged hospital stay (median duration of 29 days) and mechanical ventilation (median duration of 24 days) likely increased the susceptibility to secondary respiratory and bloodstream infections in the studied patient population.

One area particularly affected is our diets, with food supply chain disruptions, media coverage of food safety issues and restaurant closures all influencing consumer dietary behaviour. Given this situation, we pose a timely question - what is the impact of the current pandemic on longer-term meat consumption patterns? This issue is pertinent given accumulating evidence that overconsumption of meat, particularly red meat, is associated with negative environmental and health outcomes. Here, we discuss how the current pandemic has already begun to shift public awareness of illnesses linked to animals and has resulted in short-term changes in patterns of meat consumption. Past zoonotic outbreaks, such as SARS and swine flu, are also referred to, and we find that these led to similar short-term reductions in meat intake, a shift in the type of meat chosen and longer-lasting impacts on consumer perceptions of the health risks associated with meat. We conclude that, if immediate changes in eating patterns as a result of COVID-19 are retained in the longer term, one possible opportunity to emerge from the current pandemic may be a shift away from overconsumption of meat, leading to potential health and environmental benefits in the longer term.","output":"How will the COVID-19 pandemic shape the future of meat consumption?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), identified for the first time in Wuhan, China, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which moved from epidemic status to becoming a pandemic. Since its discovery in December 2019, there have been countless cases of mortality and morbidity due to this virus. Several compounds such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and remdesivir have been tested as potential therapies; however, no effective treatment is currently recommended by regulatory agencies. Some studies on respiratory non-enveloped viruses such as adenoviruses and rhinovirus and some respiratory enveloped viruses including human respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza A, parainfluenza, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have shown the antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides, correlating their effect with Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) modulation. Cardiac glycosides are secondary metabolites used to treat patients with cardiac insufficiency because they are the most potent inotropic agents. The effects of cardiac glycosides on NKA are dependent on cell type, exposure time, and drug concentration. They may also cause blockage of Na(+) and K(+) ionic transport or trigger signaling pathways. The antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides is related to cell signaling activation through NKA inhibition. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) seems to be an essential transcription factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. NFB inhibition by cardiac glycosides interferes directly with SARS-CoV-2 yield and inflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, the antiviral effect of cardiac glycosides is associated with tyrosine kinase (Src) activation, and NFB appears to be regulated by Src. Src is one of the main signaling targets of the NKA -subunit, modulating other signaling factors that may also impair viral infection. These data suggest that Src-NFB signaling modulated by NKA plays a crucial role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we discuss the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides on different respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 pathology, cell signaling pathways, and NKA as a possible molecular target for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase as a Target of Cardiac Glycosides for the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to evaluate the impact of infectious and contagious diseases and Its final impact on the economic performance anywhere and anytime We are c","output":"The Impact of Infectious and Contagious Diseases and Its Impact on the Economic Performance: The Case of Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (fACE2) gene was amplified from domestic cat lung with RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced.

We combined genomic and epidemiologic data to investigate the source of HCW infections across multiple healthcare facilities (HCFs) in the state. Phylogenetic analysis and fine-scale hierarchical clustering were performed for the entire Victorian dataset including community and healthcare cases. Facilities provided standardised epidemiological data and putative transmission links. Findings Between March and October 2020, approximately 1,240 HCW COVID-19 infection cases were identified; 765 are included here. Genomic sequencing was successful for 612 (80%) cases. Thirty-six investigations were undertaken across 12 HCFs. Genomic analysis revealed that multiple introductions of COVID-19 into facilities (31/36) were more common than single introductions (5/36). Major contributors to HCW acquisitions included mobility of staff and patients between wards and facilities, and characteristics and behaviours of individual patients including super-spreading events. Key limitations at the HCF level were identified. Interpretation Genomic epidemiological analyses enhanced understanding of HCW infections, revealing unsuspected clusters and transmission networks. Combined analysis of all HCWs and patients in a HCF should be conducted, supported by high rates of sequencing coverage for all cases in the population.

We aim to assess the factors associated with changes in the incidence of and indications for AT using population-level data. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study investigated patients who underwent AT between 1997 and 2010 by using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We examined surgical rates and indications by the calendar year as well as age, sex, hospital level, and insured residence areas for the correlating factors. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate of AT was 14.7 per 100,000 individuals during 1997C2010. Pediatric (<18 years) patients represented 48.2% of the total AT population. More than 99% of the patients underwent the AT procedures as an inpatient intervention. Longitudinal data demonstrated an increasing trend in the pediatric AT rates from 1997 (4.3/100,000) to 2010 (5.7/100,000) (p = 0.029). In the adult subgroup, a decreasing prevalence of infectious indications (p = 0.014) coincided with an increasing neoplastic indications (p = 0.001). In the pediatric subgroup, the prevalence of obstructive indications increased (p = 0.002). The logistic regression analyses indicated that the significant factors associated with the changing surgical indications for AT were the age in the adult subgroup and hospital level in the pediatric subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a low AT rate in Taiwan than that in other countries. Pediatric AT incidence increased during 1997C2010.

It is not known whether varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. The expression pattern of gap junctional protein connexin, a known marker of poor wound healing, was investigated across various stages of venous disease. METHODS Patients undergoing intervention for varicose veins were assessed according to the Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification of varicose veins. Paired 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from above the ankle (pathological) and above the knee (control). Tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and for connexin 43, connexin 30 and connexin 26. RESULTS Forty-eight paired biopsies were taken (12 each for CEAP class C0, C2, C4 and C6). The pathological skin showed progressive epithelial hyperthickening, an increase in the number and depth of rete ridges, increased inflammation and loss of dermal architecture with disease progression from C4 onwards. The overall absolute connexin expression and mean connexin expression per cell in the pathological skin similarly increased across the CEAP classes from as early as C2. Increasing levels of connexin in control skin were also noted, indicating progression of the disease proximally. Connexin 43 expression showed the strongest positive correlation between pathological and control skin. CONCLUSION Connexins were overexpressed in patients with simple varicose veins, with a stepwise increased expression through venous eczema to ulceration. Connexin 43 is a potential biomarker for venous disease. This finding suggests that varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. Surgical relevance The overexpression of connexins, a family of gap junctional proteins, is known to cause poor healing in venous leg ulceration. It is not known whether there is any association with superficial venous disease.

It is postulated that the current COVID-19 pandemic has hampered global development of pediatric oncology care programs. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively review the global impact of COVID-19 on childhood cancer clinical outcomes and care delivery. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, and the African Medical Index from inception to November 3, 2021 following PRISMA guidelines. A manual search was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on predetermined eligibility criteria. FINDINGS: The majority of studies reported patients with cancer and COVID-19 presenting as asymptomatic (HICs: 33.7%, LMICs: 22.0%) or with primary manifestations of fever (HICs: 36.1%, LMICs: 51.4%) and respiratory symptoms (HICs: 29.6%, LMICs: 11.7%). LMICs also reported a high frequency of patients presenting with cough (23.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.6%). The majority of patients were generally noted to have a good prognosis; however the crude mortality rate was higher in LMICs when compared to HICs (8.0% vs 1.8%). Moreover, the pandemic has resulted in delays and interruptions to cancer therapies and delays in childhood cancer diagnoses in both HICs and LMICs. However, these findings were disproportionately reported in LMICs, with significant staff shortages, supply chain disruptions, and limited access to cancer therapies for patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays and interruptions to childhood cancer therapies and delays in childhood cancer diagnoses, and disproportionately so within LMICs.

To halt the spread of the disease, decision makers and governments across the world have been forced to limit mobility and human interaction, which led to a complete lockdown and the closure of nonessential businesses and public places in many cities and countries. Although effective in curbing the spread of the disease, such measures have had major social and economic impacts, particularly at locations where a complete lockdown was required. In such unprecedented circumstances, decision makers were faced with the dilemma of deciding on how and when to limit mobility to curb the spread of the disease, while being considerate of the significant economic impacts of enforcing such a lockdown. Limited research in this area meant that decision makers were forced to experiment different courses of action without fully understanding the consequences of those actions. To address this critical gap and to provide decision makers with more insights on how to manage mobility during a global pandemic, this paper conducts statistical change point analysis of mobility data from 10 different countries with the aims of establishing links between mobility trends, COVID-19 infections, and COVID-19 mortality rates across different countries where different policies were adopted. Among other findings, the analysis revealed that slow responders experienced significantly higher mortality rates per 100,000 people and were forced to implement stricter lockdown strategies when compared to early responders. The analysis also shows that operating at 40% level of mobility is achievable if appropriate action is taken early enough.

Overall, female students, students enrolled in third and fourth year, living in nuclear families, and students who spent less time with family reported having higher level of depression, anxiety, and co-morbidity. Limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we were unable to make causal inferences. Also, data collected through snowball-sampling were prone to selection bias. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic imposes a greater burden on mental health of students with different socioeconomic characteristics and university type. Therefore, psychological intervention designs should address these differences.","output":"Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of depression, anxiety, and co-morbidity during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study among public and private university students of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The relationship of OSA and human coronavirus (COVID-19) in the pediatric population is unknown. We postulate that OSA is associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in children. METHODS: A retrospective review of 120 consecutive patients (<18 years) with prior polysomnogram (PSG) and COVID-19 testing from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry was conducted. Using a case control design of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative pediatric patients, we examined COVID-19 and pre-existing OSA (dichotomized AHI1) using logistic (OR,95%CI) regression and as continuous measures: AHI, oxygen(SpO2) nadir, %time SpO2<90%) using linear regression(beta+/-SE). In those positive for SARS-CoV-2(cases only), we assessed the association of OSA and World Health Organization(WHO) COVID-19 clinical outcome composite score (hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen, invasive ventilation/ECMO or death) using Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal data. RESULTS: Cases (n=36) were 11.84.4 years, 61% male, 27.8% black and 88.9% with OSA, while 85.7% of controls (n=84) had OSA. OSA was not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity: OR=1.33(0.40, 4.45,p=0.64). No significant difference between cases and controls for mean AHI 3.7(1.5,6.0) vs 3.5(1.5,7.1),p=0.91,SpO2 nadir 88.65.4 vs 89.14.4,p=0.58,%time SpO2<90% 0.05[0.00,1.00) vs 0.10 (0.00,1.00, p=0.65) respectively was noted. WHO-7 COVID-19 clinical outcome did not meet statistical significance in relation to OSA due to the low event frequency (p=0.49). Of note, those with OSA vs without OSA had a higher WHO-7 outcome score of 2 vs 0 and prevalence of hospitalization: 12.5 vs 0% respectively. Of hospitalized patients, the following was observed: 23% had moderate/severe OSA vs 4.3% mild OSA, 50% required supplemental oxygen and 25% required intubation/invasive ventilation. No deaths or readmissions were reported. High risk conditions included: 75% obesity, 50% asthma, 25% sickle cell disease and 25% hypoplastic left heart. CONCLUSION: In this first report of which we are aware focused on COVID-19 in pediatric OSA, we use a case control design leveraging COVID-19 and sleep laboratory registries. Albeit not statistically significant, pediatric patients with OSA had a higher percentage of worse clinical outcomes. Larger network studies are needed to clarify whether poorer COVID-19 outcomes may be attributable to OSA or modulated via high risk health conditions.

To our knowledge, the spread in healthcare settings between children had not been reported. Leicester was the first area in the United Kingdom to undergo a localised lockdown with reports of relatively high numbers of children affected.ObjectivesOur evaluation aimed to identify the number of clinically significant SARS-COV-2 paediatric patients (age < 18 years) presenting to our Childrens Emergency Department (CED) at the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI), investigate the effectiveness of infection control measures and examine outcomes.MethodsWe determined clinically significant infection to be that which prompted parents/carers to bring their child to the CED and be admitted. The national guidance in England at the time determined that only admitted patients are swabbed for SARS-COV-2.Clinical information on the timelines of hospital attendance, length of hospital stay (LOS) and outcomes was gathered by retrospectively from 15.03.2020 to 31.07.2020 by looking at the attendances in Nervecentre?.National infection control policies were followed, ranging from adoption of rigorous hand washing and provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for patient contacts, to the separation of the department into red (suspected COVID) and blue (non-suspected COVID) zones on the basis of pre-determined criteria.The study was ratified as a service evaluation project by the trust.Results27 children (0C15 years) tested COVID positive. 22 (81.5%) of these presented to the PED among 10777 presentations.20/22 (90.9%) patients were admitted, all were eventually discharged. Nearly all of the patients came through the red zone;21/22 (95.4%). The average Length of Stay (LOS) of these patients was 120.7 hours.2 patients were felt to have the novel Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), both needing paediatric intensive care stay. Children presented with lower respiratory tract infection (3/22;4/27), suspected sepsis (4/22;4/27), and Bronchiolitis (2/22;2/27).There was no overlap between any SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with any other patients who subsequently tested positive in the department. Thus, no clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 cross-infection was noted.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that children dont appear to be causing spread within our CED. Division of CED into two areas meant a substantial change to our working due to changes in staff allocation and challenges to CED leadership. Only a very small number of patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive- this led us to believe that the existing measures to split the departments were effective, but also perhaps, unnecessary.On the basis of this study, the splitting of the CED into red and blue zones has been abolished and the department has been merged, to avail the staffing and space resources optimally to enhance patient safety and provide best healthcare services to our patients.This study could be crucial in anticipating and managing the future PED patient flow, especially during the winters when the other seasonal viral infections are likely to overburden the services.","output":"Incidence of spread of clinically relevant SARS-CoV2 infection between children in a tertiary emergency department: an evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Professional burnout in the medical community has been present for a long time, also among mental health professionals. The aim of the study was to examine the links between loneliness, complaining and professional burnout among medical personnel in psychiatric care during a pandemic. Loneliness and complaining of the medical staff are not documented in the literature well enough. Methods: Oldenburg Burnout Questionnaire, the Loneliness Scale, the Complaint Questionnaire and authors questionnaire. The respondents: 265 medical employeesdoctors (19.2%), nurses (69.8%), paramedics (4.9%), medical caregivers (5.7%). Results: Loneliness and complaining are significant predictors of exhaustion. The model explains 18% of exhaustion variance. Loneliness, complaining and job seniority are also predictors of disengagement; the model allows to predict 10% of the variance of disengagement. Women are more prone to complain. Complaining significantly correlates with direct support from management. A high rate of loneliness correlates, in a statistically significant way, with worse work organization, less management support, worse atmosphere in the team and with more irresponsible attitudes of colleagues. Conclusions: Loneliness and complaining can be used to predict occupational burnout. Women and people without management support complain more often.

Responding to the challenge of implementing remote care in chronic pain services, a specialty highly dependent on doctor-patient rapport, physical examination, and frequent follow-up visits requires extensive adaptation involving administrative processes and clinical routines. We present our experience of a successful rapid adaptation to telemedicine paradigm as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic during a time of marked restriction of access to ambulatory hospital services for pediatric and adult chronic pain patients. This narrative review covers current scientific evidence for the use of telehealth for chronic pain management and describes in detail the challenges to implement telemedicine in ambulatory clinics from different perspectives. Best practices for telehealth use are recommended. A proposal for remote physical examination of pain patients is made, based on available evidence in the fields of musculoskeletal medicine and neurology comparing in-person vs remote physical examination. As an internal quality control process, an informal online survey was conducted to assess thoughts and experiences among patients and caregivers using telemedicine consultation services at the pediatric pain clinic. Providing chronic pain management services through telehealth is a viable option for many patients and health care professionals. This is reliant on the availability of appropriate materials and training, with guidelines for both patients and health care workers.

Car-free days and events are often designed to alleviate the impact of transportation-related air pollution, noise, physical inactivity, traffic congestion, or other detrimental externalities of private motor vehicle travel. We reviewed existing peer-reviewed and gray literature to understand the variety of potential public health impacts that have been measured as a result of car-free days or events and associated changes in environmental exposures and lifestyles. RECENT FINDINGS: The impacts of car-free days and events are highly variable and seem to depend on the scope (frequency, duration, and geographic size) and goals of each car-free day and event. Most of the existing literature measures impacts in terms of air and noise pollution and some studies focus on physical activity metrics. In some cases, car-free days and events were successful in reducing the concentration of certain air pollutants but had little or adverse impacts on the concentration of others. Often, traffic is diverted from cordoned areas to surrounding streets, displacing traffic congestion and adverse environmental exposures to other areas of a city, with potential understudied implications to environmental justice. SUMMARY: Car-free days and events are often an attractive policy option; however, they require intensive planning to be successful. The organization and execution of car-free days and events, as well as public support and stakeholder engagement, greatly influence the level of success and the sustainability of such initiatives. Health benefits may be a palatable and convincing argument to the general public. However, very few studies focus on actual health impacts associated with car-free days and events. Future research could be most useful if it focused on measuring health outcomes associated with car-free days and events through longitudinal studies.","output":"The Impacts of Car-Free Days and Events on the Environment and Human Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a novel testing and containment strategy in order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV2 while permitting large parts of the population to resume social and economic activity.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic a reduction in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction with an increase in in-hospital mortality has been observed. In our region the pandemic temporal trend was sinusoidal with peaks and valleys. A first outbreak was in March 2020 (248.12 cases for 100000 inhabitants), a reduction in May 2020 (16.68 cases for 100000 inhabitants) and a second outbreak in November 2020 (540.17 cases for 100000 inhabitants;data from Italian Health Ministry). Methods. Our hospital was reorganized as one of the 13 Macro-Hubs identified in Lombardy and we retrospectively analysed consecutive STEMI patients hospitalized in the three different phases of COVID-19 pandemic. Results. Despite no presence of COVID patients in the second phase we did not registered any difference in the number of STEMI hospitalized in the three phases (38 vs 34 vs 27;incidence STEMI/die: 1.19 vs 1.06 vs 0.90;p=ns). At multivariate analysis for the entire population COVID-19 infection was the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 12.6 [95% CI] 2.18-72.77;p = 0.005). Focusing on COVID-19 patients they experienced a 5-time increased incidence of in-hospital mortality (COVID-19pos vs COVID-19ne9, 47.1% vs 8.6%;p <0.0001) mainly driven by a higher incidence of respiratory complications (COVID-19pos vs COVID-19neg, 41.2% vs 6.2%;p<0.0001 with a similar incidence of cardiac death (COVID-IQ5 vs COVID-19n 11.8% vs 6.2%;p=ns) (Fig. 1). Among STEMI admitted during different phases of pandemic, this study found an increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19;the co-presence of COVID-19 infection leads to an increase of mortality mostly related to respiratory complications. Interestingly the different incidence in the general population of COVID-19 did not influenced the incidence of STEMI. Conclusion. In conclusion our data suggest the crucial need for an early and precise diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in STEMI to establish a correct management of this very high-risk patients.","output":"Influence of different covid-19 pandemic phases on stemi: Experience from an Italian hub centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Randomized controlled trials showed efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). There is the need to quantify vaccine effectiveness in real-word contexts, including people at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as health care workers (HCWs). Objectives To evaluate vaccine effectiveness among hospital HCWs. Methods We performed a cohort study among HCWs of a large University hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy by merging routinely collected data on demographics, COVID-19 vaccination, and polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) tests performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up started on December 27, 2020 (start of vaccination campaign). We included HCWs never PCR-positive before the start date and with at least a PCR test afterwards. Vaccination was treated as a time-dependent variable by calculating person-years (PY) at risk before and after vaccine doses. Subjects contributed PY until first positive PCR test (cases) or last test for never positive HCWs (to avoid immortal time bias). We calculated infection rates (cases per 1000 PY), rate ratios (RR, with a Poisson regression model adjusted for gender, age, occupation and 30-day periods), vaccine effectiveness (VE = (1-RR)x100) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) taking never vaccinated HCWs as reference. Results As of May 10, there were 3,152 vaccinated (97% with BNT162b2, 140 with one dose, 2,679 with two doses) and 333 non-vaccinated.

The aim of this study was to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk and COVID-19 prevalence according to tumor subtype in the resident cancer population of the Province of Parma (Emilia Romagna Region, Nothern Italy) during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Methods: We analyzed data from the Parma Province Cancer Registry, COVID-19 hospital medical records, and local surveillance system of all laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning of the outbreak (February, 20) to July 19, 2020. All the Parma resident cancer population was classified as either active or inactive according to the evidence of any referral to health services, for any reason, during the observation period. Study analyses were adjusted for patient demographics, tumor subtype and period of cancer diagnosis. Results: 40,148 cancer pts (mean age 68;57.8% females;45.1% active) were analyzed. The cumulative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.2% for cancer pts vs. 7% for non-cancer subjects (P < 0.0001). The overall COVID-19 attack rate was 2.2% (95% CI, 2.0-2.4) and 2.6% (95% CI, 2.4-2.9) for inactive and active cancer pts, respectively. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in active vs. inactive cancer subjects (HR 1.18, P = 0.01). In the active cancer group, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in lung cancer pts vs. other tumors (HR 4.3). In the same group, HR for breast cancer pts was 0.86. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis of COVID-19 cumulative incidence showed a significant interaction between active patient status and hematological malignancies. Conclusions: In our study, cancer pts were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in active vs. inactive cancer subjects. However, cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases and pts with different tumor types had differing susceptibility to COVID-19 phenotypes.

This study compared CMV and NPPV combined with a noninvasive strategy for clearing secretions in HE and AECOPD patients.The present study is a prospective cohort study of AECOPD and HE patients enrolled between October 2013 and August 2015 in a critical care unit of a major university teaching hospital in China.A total of 74 patients received NPPV and 90 patients received CMV. Inclusion criteria included the following: physician-diagnosed AECOPD, spontaneous airway clearance of excessive secretions, arterial blood gas analysis requiring intensive care, moderate-to-severe dyspnea, and a Kelly-Matthay scale score of 3 to 5. Exclusion criteria included the following: preexisting psychiatric/neurological disorders unrelated to HE, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, upper airway obstruction, acute coronary syndromes, preadmission tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation, and urgent endotracheal intubation for cardiovascular, psychomotor agitation, or severe hemodynamic conditions.Intensive care unit participants were managed by NPPV. Participants received standard treatment consisting of controlled oxygen therapy during NPPV-free periods; antibiotics, intravenous doxofylline, corticosteroids (e.g., salbutamol and ambroxol), and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin; and therapy for comorbidities if necessary. Nasogastric tubes were inserted only in participants who developed gastric distension. No pharmacological sedation was administered.The primary and secondary outcome measures included comparative complication rates, durations of ventilation and hospitalization, number of invasive devices/patient, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates.Arterial blood gases and sensorium levels improved significantly within 2 hours in the NPPV group with lower hospital mortality, fewer complications and invasive devices/patient, and superior weaning off mechanical ventilation.

International guidelines from relevant societies, journals and forums were also assessed for relevance. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. RESULTS: A review of the selected literature revealed that clinical deterioration in COVID-19 is attributed to the interplay between endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy and dysregulated inflammation. Aspirin has anti-inflammatory effects, antiplatelet aggregation, anticoagulant properties as well as pleiotropic effects on endothelial function. During the COVID-19 pandemic, low-dose aspirin is used effectively in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement, prevention of pre-eclampsia and postdischarge treatment for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Prehospital low-dose aspirin therapy may reduce the risk of intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, whereas aspirin association with mortality is still debatable. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend a low-dose aspirin regimen for primary prevention of arterial thromboembolism in patients aged 40C70 years who are at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or an intermediate risk with a risk-enhancer and have a low risk of bleeding.

Monocyte-associated FCoV viremia was demonstrated by immunohistology, RNA in situ hybridization, and electron micropscopy. Granulomatous phlebitis at different stages of development was observed. Vasculitic processes ranged from attachment and emigration of FCoV-infected monocytes to vascular/perivascular granulomatous infiltrates with destruction of the vascular basal lamina. Monocytes as well as perivascular macrophages were activated because they were strongly positive for CD18 and expressed cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) and matrix metalloproteinase-9. In addition, general activation of endothelial cells, represented by major histocompatibility complex II upregulation, was observed in all cases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to aging and was recently reported to be among the major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in older people. The symptomatology of COVID-19 indicates that lethal outcomes of infection rely on neurogenic mechanisms. The present review compiles the available knowledge pointing to the convergence of COVID-19 complications with the mechanisms of autonomic dysfunctions in AD and aging. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prone to neuroinvasion from the lung along the vagus nerve up to the brainstem autonomic nervous centers involved in the coupling of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms. The brainstem autonomic network allows SARS-CoV-2 to trigger a neurogenic switch to hypertension and hypoventilation, which may act in synergy with aging- and AD-induced dysautonomias, along with an inflammatory \\"storm\\". The lethal outcomes of COVID-19, like in AD and unhealthy aging, likely rely on a critical hypoactivity of the efferent vagus nerve cholinergic pathway, which is involved in lowering cardiovascular pressure and systemic inflammation tone. We further discuss the emerging evidence supporting the use of 1) the non-invasive stimulation of vagus nerve as an additional therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19, and 2) the demonstrated vagal tone index, i.e., heart rate variability, via smartphone-based applications as a non-serological low-cost diagnostic of COVID-19.

Methods: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. Results: While the search yielded numerous publications, most studies were methodologically weak. Pregnant individuals were not found to experience more severe symptoms than the general population, and intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. Conclusion: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than the general population, however they seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from multiple centres were divided into postoperative adjuvant TACE with (n=57) or without (n=142) TKI administration groups. The disease-free survival (DFS) curve was depicted by the KaplanCMeier method, and the difference between the two groups was tested using the log rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for DFS. Additionally, three propensity score analyses were performed to minimise the potential confounding factors to facilitate a more reliable conclusion. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS: The 1-and 2-year DFS rates of the TACE plus TKI treatment group were 45.5% and 34.9%, respectively, which were significantly better than those of the TACE alone group (26.8% and 18.3%, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified adjuvant TACE plus TKI treatment as an independent prognostic factor for DFS (hazard ratio: 0.611, 95% confidence interval: 0.408C0.915, P=0.017). Further analysis based on the various propensity score methods yielded similar results. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with tumour diameter 5 cm, tumour number <3, absence of hepatic vein tumour thrombus and bile duct tumour thrombus, ruptured tumours, and stage IIIB could benefit more from TACE plus TKI treatment (all P<0.05). Some patients (33.33%) experienced grade 3 AEs in the TACE plus TKI group.

Access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally became the principal source of hope for these countries. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines was not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced the difficult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing the price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against the concerns over their efficacy and safety. We aimed to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues. METHODS: We searched for opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages. We provided data on the debate within three countries, drawn from social media postings and other sources. The opinion data was not restricted by source and time. This allowed collecting a wide range of possible opinions that could be expressed regarding COVID-19 vaccine supply and human participation in the vaccine trial. We recognized ethical issues and possible questions concerning different ethical frameworks. We also considered scientific data and other information, in the process of reasoning. RESULTS: As a result, public views on their respective government policies on COVID-19 vaccine supply ranged from strongly negative to slightly positive. We extracted the most important issues from public debates, for our analysis. The first issue involved trade-offs between quantity, speed, price, freedom, efficacy, and safety in the vaccines. The second set of issues arose in connection with the request to site a randomized trial in one of the countries (Uzbekistan). After considering additional evidence, we weighed individual and public risks against the benefits to make specific judgements concerning every issue.

Although the STEC O157 serogroup accounts for the highest number of infections, HUS-related complications and deaths, the STEC non-O157, as a group, accounts for a larger proportion of STEC infections and lower HUS cases. There is limited information available on how to recognize non-O157 serotypes associated with severe disease. The objectives of this study were to describe a patient with STEC non-O157 infection complicated with HUS and to conduct a comparative whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis among the patient's STEC clinical isolate and STEC O157 and non-O157 strains. RESULTS: The STEC O145:H25 strain EN1I-0044-2 was isolated from a pediatric patient with diarrhea, HUS and severe neurologic and cardiorespiratory complications, who was enrolled in a previously reported case-control study of acute gastroenteritis conducted in Davidson County, Tennessee in 2013. The strain EN1I-0044-2 genome sequence contained a chromosome and three plasmids. Two of the plasmids were similar to those present in O145:H25 strains whereas the third unique plasmid EN1I-0044-2_03 shared no similarity with other STEC plasmids, and it carried 23 genes of unknown function.

The chief abnormalities were right ventricle (RV) dilatation (41%) and RV dysfunction (27%). RV impairment was associated with increased D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels. In contrast, left ventricular function was hyperdynamic or normal in most (89%) patients.","output":"Echocardiographic Findings in Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building a national system of social governance (guojia zhili tixi), which is the long-running governance dream of Xi Jinping, has triggered the creation of Chinas smart state using the tools of new information technologies to advance governance capacity (zhili nengli). These systems were already deployed nationally when the COVID-19 pandemic hit China, but were connected at a lesser capacity, targeting specific domains of security, industry or government administration. In response to the crisis, multiple technologies have been merged, exceeding the scope of their originally intended functions. This is known as function creep, when surveillant technologies remain functional past achievement of their intended purpose, or surveillant assemblages, where multiple surveillant technologies are combined. As more countries turn to digitalisation to increase public security and intensify social and market governance, the expansion of surveillant functions in China and their now-palpable effects on peoples lives raises new and pressing questions for scholars and decision-makers alike.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pulmonary function and exercise capacity of patients treated for COVID 19 pneumonia after discharge. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 79 people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March and October 2020 were evaluated at least two months after discharge. A pulmonary function test and a six-minute walk test were administered to the individuals included in the study. RESULTS: Restrictive-type disorder was detected in 21.5% of the individuals who were evaluated at least two months after discharge. The forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) values of the pulmonary function tests were significantly lower in the individuals with severe/critical clinical disease compared to those with moderate disease (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). Although the six-minute walk test (6MWT) distances were lower in the severe/critical group than in the moderate group, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia may develop a restrictive type of pulmonary dysfunction. Therefore, survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia should be evaluated for pulmonary function and rehabilitation needs and should be provided with treatment as required.","output":"Evaluation of pulmonary function and exercise capacity after COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The development of detachable coils is one of the most pivotal developments in neurointervention, providing a tool that could be used to treat a wide variety of hemorrhagic stroke.

The burden of these syndemic conditions is influenced by limited access to health and social services to prevent and treat these conditions. The syndemic nature of these factors necessitates an integrated, coordinated approach to address them simultaneously. We analyzed characteristics of Latino-serving organizations in Philadelphia, PA, that provide SAVAME-related health and/or social services, and their interorganizational collaborations to meet the needs of Philadelphias Latino communities. We surveyed Latino-serving organizations (N=43) identified through existing resource directories and key informants. Network analyses identified patterns and density of collaborative ties (i.e., referrals, administrative, or planning/advocacy) across organizations and characterized these ties by type of service. Density (expressed as percent of all possible ties) revealed a higher referral rate (40%) than administrative (29%) or planning (26%) coordination. Network sociograms display clusters of providers by geography. Examination of bonding (within-group) ties revealed comparable perceptions of high value among both South/Center Philadelphia (57%) and in North Philadelphia providers (56%), but bridging (between-group) ties suggest lower levels of high-value perceptions (24%). No evident clustering by type of service based on syndemic factor was observed. Density of bridging across types of providers was highest for referrals (38%) followed by planning (23%) and administrative coordination (20%). Interventions to promote collaboration between providers should focus on facilitating administrative and planning collaborations that leverage existing capacity of the network.

Methods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) relevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating prevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current and former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was performed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8C9.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16C0.25, p &lt; 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19C0.30, p &lt; 0.001). Current smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06C2.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27C0.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added (n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19C0.38, p &lt; 0.001) and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24C0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be considered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may have a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and by the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored in laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.","output":"Current smoking, former smoking, and adverse outcome among hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic overview of mental and physical disorders of informal caregivers based on population-based studies with good methodological quality is lacking. Therefore, our aim was to systematically summarize mortality, incidence, and prevalence estimates of chronic diseases in informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Following PRISMA recommendations, we searched major healthcare databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and Web of Science) systematically for relevant studies published in the last 10 years (without language restrictions) (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020200314). We included only observational cross-sectional and cohort studies with low risk of bias (risk scores 0C2 out of max 8) that reported the prevalence, incidence, odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), mean- or sum-scores for health-related outcomes in informal caregivers and non-caregivers. For a thorough methodological quality assessment, we used a validated checklist. The synthesis of the results was conducted by grouping outcomes. We included 22 studies, which came predominately from the USA and Europe. Informal caregivers had a significantly lower mortality than non-caregivers. Regarding chronic morbidity outcomes, the results from a large longitudinal German health-insurance evaluation showed increased and statistically significant incidences of severe stress, adjustment disorders, depression, diseases of the spine and pain conditions among informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers. In cross-sectional evaluations, informal caregiving seemed to be associated with a higher occurrence of depression and of anxiety (ranging from 4 to 51% and 2 to 38%, respectively), pain, hypertension, diabetes and reduced quality of life. Results from our systematic review suggest that informal caregiving may be associated with several mental and physical disorders. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution, as the cross-sectional studies cannot determine temporal relationships. The lower mortality rates compared to non-caregivers may be due to a healthy-carer bias in longitudinal observational studies; however, these and other potential benefits of informal caregiving deserve further attention by researchers.","output":"Mortality, Morbidity and Health-Related Outcomes in Informal Caregivers Compared to Non-Caregivers: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Contemporary health policy is shifting towards remotely delivered care. A growing need to provide effective and accessible services, with maximal population reach has stimulated demand for flexible and efficient service models. The implementation of evidence-based practice has been slow, leaving many services ill equipped to respond to requests for non-face-to-face delivery. To address this translation gap, and provide empirically derived evidence to support large-scale practice change, our study aimed to explore practitioners' perspectives of the factors that enhance the delivery of a NICE-recommended psychological intervention, i.e. guided self-help by telephone (GSH-T), in routine care. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to analyse our data, identify essential behaviour change processes and encourage the successful implementation of remote working in clinical practice. METHOD: Thirty-four psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) from the UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services were interviewed. Data were first analysed inductively, with codes cross-matched deductively to the TDF. RESULTS: Analysis identified barriers to the delivery, engagement and implementation of GSH-T, within eight domains from the TDF: (i) Deficits in practitioner knowledge, (ii) Sub-optimal practitioner telephone skills, (iii) Practitioners' lack of beliefs in telephone capabilities and self-confidence, (iv) Practitioners' negative beliefs about consequences, (v) Negative emotions, (vi) Professional role expectations (vii) Negative social influences, and (viii) Challenges in the environmental context and resources. A degree of interdependence was observed between the TDF domains, such that improvements in one domain were often reported to confer secondary advantages in another. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple TDF domains emerge as relevant to improve delivery of GSH-T; and these domains are theoretically and practically interlinked. A multicomponent approach is recommended to facilitate the shift from in-person to telephone-based service delivery models, and prompt behaviour change at practitioner, patient and service levels. At a minimum, the development of practitioners' telephone skills, an increase in clients' awareness of telephone-based treatment, dilution of negative preconceptions about telephone treatment, and robust service level guidance and standards for implementation are required. This is the first study that provides clear direction on how to improve telephone delivery and optimise implementation, aligning with current mental health policy and service improvement.","output":"What influences practitioners' readiness to deliver psychological interventions by telephone?

However, the performance of these tests in non-clinical settings and among one of the main target populations in schools-asymptomatic children-is unclear. To address this gap, we examined the positive and negative concordance between the BinaxNOW&#8482; rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay and an RT-PCR test among children at a community-based Covid-19 testing site. METHODS: We conducted rapid antigen (BinaxNOW&#8482;) and oral fluid RT-PCR (Curative Labs) tests on children presenting at a walk-up testing site in Los Angeles County from November 25, 2020 to December 9, 2020. Positive concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR positive participants that were also antigen positive. Negative concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR negative participants that were also antigen negative. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between positive or negative concordance and participant age, race-ethnicity, sex at birth, symptoms and Ct values. RESULTS: 226 children tested positive on RT-PCR; 127 children or 56.2% (95% CI: 49.5% to 62.8%) of these also tested positive on the rapid antigen test. Positive concordance was higher among symptomatic children (64.4%; 95% CI: 53.4% to 74.4%) compared to asymptomatic children (51.1%; 95% CI: 42.5% to 59.7%). Positive concordance was negatively associated with Ct values and was 93.8% (95% CI: 69.8% to 99.8%) for children with Ct values less than or equal to 25. 548 children tested negative on RT-PCR; 539 or 98.4% (95% CI: 96.9% to 99.2%) of these also tested negative on the rapid antigen test. Negative concordance was higher among asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen testing can successfully identify most COVID infections in children with viral load levels likely to be infectious. Serial rapid testing may help compensate for limited sensitivity in early infection.","output":"Evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children: Implications for screening in a school setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The classification of imbalanced data streams is gaining more and more interest.

In this review, the author discusses an emerging arms race for cellular resources between viruses and hosts, which occur during the early events of virus-host interactions. Recent findings with tomato bushy stunt virus and its hosts revealed that the need of the virus to exploit and co-opt given members of protein families provides an opportunity for the host to deploy additional members of the same or associated protein family to interfere with virus replication. Three examples with well-established heat shock protein 70 and RNA helicase protein families and the ubiquitin network will be described to illustrate this model on the early arms race for cellular resources between tombusviruses and their hosts. We predict that arms race for resources with additional cellular protein families will be discovered with tombusviruses.

METHODS We evaluated 20 patients with newly diagnosed TETs who had undergone concomitant 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 111In-octreotide SPECT. Thymic epithelial tumors were classified by World Health Organization (WHO) as low-risk thymomas (5), high-risk thymomas (4), and thymic carcinomas (11, among which 6 neuroendocrine tumors). Patients were staged according to Masaoka system. 18F-FDG-PET/CT was performed and SUV(max) of primary tumors was recorded. 111In-octreotide SPECT of the thorax was performed, and tumor-to-background ratio was determined on the 24-hour coronal sections. RESULTS All patients showed increased 18F-FDG uptake in mediastinal lesions. SUV(max) were significantly correlated with WHO classification (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and with Masaoka stage (r = 0.60, P < 0.01). SUV(max) of low-risk thymomas (mean [SD], 2.87 [0.83]) were significantly lower than those of high-risk thymomas (mean [SD], 7.21 [1.73], P < 0.01) and of thymic carcinomas (mean [SD], 9.39 [5.80], P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was found between high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas. SUV(max) of all high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas was 4.5 or greater. All primary tumors were detected by In-octreotide SPECT, and tumor-to-background ratios ranged between 1.67 and 10.10. No statistically significant correlation was found between tumor-to-background ratios and WHO classification (r = 0.24, P = 0.36) and Masaoka stages (r = 0.31, P = 0.23). However tumor-to-background ratios of thymic neuroendocrine tumors (mean [SD], 5.71 [3.09]) were significantly higher than those of all other TETs with SUV(max) of 4.5 or greater (mean [SD], 2.41 [0.56]; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan allows to differentiate high-risk epithelial tumors and thymic carcinomas from low-risk thymomas, whereas 111In-octreotide SPECT may identify neuroendocrine tumors among those showing high 18F-FDG uptake.","output":"Combined imaging with 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 111In-labeled octreotide SPECT for evaluation of thymic epithelial tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on the impact of COVID19 in Australia.

The overall purpose of this research is to examine how digital extension can address gender inequality in rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 crisis by designing and evaluating the gendered impacts of a digital extension intervention delivered to 624 farmers (363 men and 261 women) (which included phone distribution, radio and SMS messages, and sharing of information prompts) in northern Tunisia. In order to assess the effectiveness of gender-responsive digital extension that targets husband and wife pairs, as opposed to only men, we employed logistic regression and descriptive statistics to analyze a sample of 242 farmers (141 women and 141 men). We find that phone ownership facilitated women's access to their social network, as well as agricultural information and services, ultimately improving their participation in household decision making and agricultural production. We find that gender-responsive digital extension is effective for men and especially women in terms of usefulness, learning, and adoption. We identified education level and cooperative membership as important factors that determine the impact of digital extension services on farmers and demonstrate the positive impact of radio programming. We recommend strengthening phone access for women, targeting information (including through non-written ways) to both husbands and wives, using sharing prompts, and more rigorous extension for knowledge-intensive topics such as conservation agriculture and rural collectives.","output":"Dear Brother Farmer';: Gender-Responsive Digital Extension in Tunisia during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seminal vesicles are an integral part of the male reproductive accessory gland system. They produce a complex array of secretions containing bioactive constituents that support gamete function and promote reproductive success, with emerging evidence suggesting these secretions are influenced by our environment. Despite their significance, the biology of seminal vesicles remains poorly defined. Here, we complete the first proteomic assessment of mouse seminal vesicles and assess the impact of the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Mice were administered acrylamide (25 mg/kg bw/day) or control daily for five consecutive days prior to collecting seminal vesicle tissue. A total of 5013 proteins were identified in the seminal vesicle proteome with bioinformatic analyses identifying cell proliferation, protein synthesis, cellular death, and survival pathways as prominent biological processes. Secreted proteins were among the most abundant, and several proteins are linked with seminal vesicle phenotypes. Analysis of the effect of acrylamide on the seminal vesicle proteome revealed 311 differentially regulated (FC  1.5, p  0.05, 205 up-regulated, 106 downregulated) proteins, orthogonally validated via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Pathways that initiate protein synthesis to promote cellular survival were prominent among the dysregulated pathways, and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR, p = 6.69E-07) was a top-ranked upstream driver. Oxidative stress was implicated as contributing to protein changes, with acrylamide causing an increase in 8-OHdG in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (fivefold increase, p = 0.016) and the surrounding smooth muscle layer (twofold increase, p = 0.043). Additionally, acrylamide treatment caused a reduction in seminal vesicle secretion weight (36% reduction, p = 0.009) and total protein content (25% reduction, p = 0.017). Together these findings support the interpretation that toxicant exposure influences male accessory gland physiology and highlights the need to consider the response of all male reproductive tract tissues when interpreting the impact of environmental stressors on male reproductive function.","output":"Proteomic Dissection of the Impact of Environmental Exposures on Mouse Seminal Vesicle Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects approximately 200,000 individuals per year worldwide. There are more than 27 million people worldwide living with long-term disability due to SCI. Historically, it was thought that the central nervous system (CNS) had little ability for regeneration; however, more recent studies have demonstrated potential for repair within the CNS. Because of this, there exists a renewed interest in the discovery of novel approaches to promote regeneration in the CNS including the spinal cord. It is important to know the roles of the microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulation of pathogenesis in SCI and the potentials of the miRNA-based clinical interventions for controlling post-injury symptoms and improving functional recovery. The miRNAs, which are non-coding RNAs with an average of 22 nucleotides in length, are post-transcriptional gene regulators that cause degradation of the target mRNAs and thus negatively control their translation. This review article focuses on current research related to miRNAs and their roles in modulating SCI symptoms, asserting that miRNAs contribute to critical post-SCI molecular processes including neuroplasticity, functional recovery, astrogliosis, neuropathic pain, inflammation, and apoptosis.

We adapted an established cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention as an online version for use during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. METHODS: Development and adaptation procedure of the internet-based CBT?I (iCBT-I) prevention and early intervention training is described. Sessions and topics are shown in detail. The Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were used to assess acceptance. Sleep problems of university staff members were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI). RESULTS: The online-adapted version consisted of seven modules. Contents of sessions and topics were implemented based on video clips. Drawings were added to information regarding sleep and sleep hygiene as well as addressing stress and cognitions. In all, 15 individuals participated in this pilot study. The new iCBT?I self-learning prevention training was well accepted. In addition, participants scored the online version as helpful based on the OSTA. Prior to online training, 89% of the participants reported impaired sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, and 56% had a PSQI score over 10. After training 78% of participants showed reduced sleep problems according to PSQI and 56% reached clinically significant enhancement. In addition, after training 44% were healthy sleepers.

After an exhaustive study, the Intelligent Internet of Things (IIoT) has been determined to be a key actor in the pandemic's wake, with a leading role in the health sector. The proposed approach includes an extensive study of the new role of the IoT4D for achieving the SDGs in our forever changed world.","output":"IoT for Global Development to Achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: The New Scenario After the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic-driven global recession has already triggered a rapid decline in global commodity prices, particularly of energy products. This is taking place on top of a downward trend in commodity prices that was already underway. Yet it remains unclear how long this decline will last given the uncertainty about the global recession. In this comment, we provide an overview of evidence using 150 years of data on commodity prices and global output. Commodity prices have experienced trends as well as four long-term cycles (super cycles) since the late 19th century, with the latter dependent on world demand. Although recent trends have been diverse, the two recent super cycles have been synchronized. The last one started at the turn of the century and had its peak in the early 2010s. Future trends would be determined by the weakness of global aggregate demand, changes in the global energy economy to mitigate climate change, and the weight of sub-Saharan Africa population on tropical commodities.","output":"The future of commodity prices and the pandemic-driven global recession: Evidence from 150 years of data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chile has been viewed as an exemplar of social and economic progress in Latin America, with its health system attracting considerable attention.

Several studies have demonstrated that healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 reported various affective disorders such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. However, the mechanism underlying the association between trauma exposure and depressive symptom among frontline hospital staff has yet to be investigated. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms among frontline healthcare professionals in Shenzhen, China, particularly examining its association with trauma exposure, intrusive rumination and organizational silence. Methods: : Data of the study came from a time-lagged panel questionnaire survey with three waves of measurement from February, 2020 to May, 2020 at an infectious diseases hospital of Shenzhen which accommodated all the confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients. Using clustersampling design, a total of 134 frontline healthcare professionals directly involved inproviding diagnosis, treatment and nursing services for COVID-19 patients completed three wave web survey. A moderated mediation model was performed to examine the complex interplay among the major study variables. Results: : Trauma exposure was significantly related with depression of frontline healthcare professionals. Intrusive rumination mediated the effect of trauma exposure on depressive symptom, and organization silence moderated the relationship between intrusive rumination and depressive symptoms. Intrusive rumination showed stronger effect on depressive while organization silences was at a lower level. Conclusions: : This research demonstrates the pivotal role that intrusive rumination and organizational silence play in predicting the depressive symptoms among the frontline healthcare professionals coping with COVID-19.","output":"Trauma Exposure and Depression among Frontline Health Professionals During COVID-19 Outbreak in China: The Role of Intrusive Rumination and Organizational Silence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of July 22(nd) 2020, more than 14,9 million cases have been reported in more than 188 countries/territories, leading to more than 616000 deaths. One of the main challenges facing health authorities has been testing for the virus on a sufficiently comprehensive scale. The pandemic has been an impetus for the wastewater community as it has inspired scientists to look to wastewater to help fill in the gap of measuring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within a given community. Testing the wastewater may serve as an early warning system allowing timely interventions. Although viral shedding varies among individuals and over the course of their infection, the sewage system can blend these variations into an average that represents the wider studied community. The urgent need has led to a lack of coherent reporting of data regarding the analysis, as these huge and remarkable efforts by the wastewater scientific community were made in a very short time. Important information on the analytical approach is often lacking, while there is still no optimisation of the methodology, including sampling, sample storage and concentration, RNA extraction and detection/quantification. This review aims at identifying the main issues for consideration, relating to the development of validated methodological protocols for the virus quantitative analysis in wastewater. Their inclusion will enable the methodological optimisation of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater analyses, transforming the wastewater infrastructure into a source of useful information for the health sector.","output":"Sewage analysis as a tool for the COVID-19 pandemic response and management: the urgent need for optimised protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the causes of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and otalgia, as well as hearing loss relevant for clinicians in the field of neurology.

Africa is the likely home to the ancestors of taxa residing within the Genus Lyssavirus, Family Rhabdoviridae. Diverse lyssaviruses are envisioned as co-evolving with bats, as the ultimate reservoirs, over seemingly millions of years. In terms of relative distribution, overt abundance, and resulting progeny, rabies virus is the most successful lyssavirus species today, but for unknown reasons. All mammals are believed to be susceptible to rabies virus infection. Besides reservoirs among the Chiroptera, meso-carnivores also serve as major historical hosts and are represented among the canids, raccoons, skunks, mongooses, and ferret badgers. Perpetuating as a disease of nature with the mammalian central nervous system as niche, host breadth alone precludes any candidacy for true eradication. Despite having the highest case fatality of any infectious disease and a burden in excess of or comparative to other major zoonoses, rabies remains neglected. Once illness appears, no treatment is proven to prevent death. Paradoxically, vaccines were developed more than a century ago, but the clear majority of human cases are unvaccinated. Tens of millions of people are exposed to suspect rabid animals and tens of thousands succumb annually, primarily children in developing countries, where canine rabies is enzootic. Rather than culling animal populations, one of the most cost-effective strategies to curbing human fatalities is the mass vaccination of dogs. Building on considerable progress to date, several complementary actions are needed in the near future, including a more harmonized approach to viral taxonomy, enhanced de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance, focal pathogen discovery and characterization, applied pathobiological research for therapeutics, improved estimates of canine populations at risk, actual production of required vaccines and related biologics, strategies to maximize prevention but minimize unnecessary human prophylaxis, and a long-term, realistic plan for sustained global program support to achieve success in disease control, prevention, and elimination.","output":"Lyssaviruses and rabies: current conundrums, concerns, contradictions and controversies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For survival analysis in comparative coronavirus disease 2019 trials, the routinely used hazard ratio may not provide a meaningful summary of the treatment effect The mean survival time difference/ratio is an intuitive, assumption-free alternative However, for short-term studies, landmark mortality rate differences/ratios are more clinically relevant and should be formally analyzed and reported","output":"Survival Analysis of Treatment Efficacy in Comparative Coronavirus Disease 2019 Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Single site laparoscopic techniques and technology exploit maximum usefulness from confined incisions.

Interventions In the ED, Patient was started on antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftriaxone), nebulizer treatments, intravenous fluids, and intramuscular corticosteroids (methylprednisolone). On hospital admission, she was initiated on antiviral Remdesivir and received 1 unit of convalescent plasma. Self-proning was encouraged, yet Patient required progressive increase in oxygen (O2) supplementation. She was intubated from Hospital Day (HD) 4 to 7. Wound care assessments began on HD10; wounds to low back and bilateral buttocks were noted. By HD15, O2 requirements were further weaned and Patient was transferred to Acute Inpatient Rehab. On Rehab admission, Patient had Leukocytosis and wounds noted as Unstageable. Antibiotic coverage was increased (Cefepime). By HD28/ Rehab Day (RD) 13, wound culture was positive, and antibiotic regimen was further supplemented (Metronidazole, Fluconazole, Daptomycin). MRI thoracic spine and pelvis demonstrated necrotizing soft-tissue infection. Surgical debridement occurred HD31/RD16 with subsequent anemia, requiring transfusion.

The World Health Organization declared the fi rst influenza pandemic of the 21st century on 11 June 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS Confirmed cases notified to the Ministry of Health between 27 May and 9 July 2009 were analysed. Various indicators of influenza activity were monitored throughout the study period. Estimates of the number of cases of H1N1-2009 were made using the number of polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness and the weekly prevalence of H1N1-2009. RESULTS Cases in Singapore affected mainly young adults, youths and children. By the end of September 2009, it was estimated that at least 270,000 persons had been infected by pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Singapore. The peak number of cases occurred during E-week 30 (26 July-1 August) when an estimated 45,000 cases were seen in polyclinics and GP clinics. The hospitalisation, severe illness and mortality rates were estimated at 6 per 1000 cases, 0.3 per 1000 cases and 6.7 per 100,000 cases, respectively. The most common risk factors among hospitalised adult cases were asthma and diabetes. For hospitalised children, the most common risk factors were being under 5 years of age and asthma. The most common risk factors among persons with severe illness were diabetes in adults and epilepsy and being under 5 years of age in children. About half of cases with severe illness required mechanical ventilation. In addition, one-fifth of cases with severe illness had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

To mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the Ghanaian health workforce, the government implemented a strategy to recruit qualified but unemployed health workers to fill staffing gaps and incentivise all public sector health workers. This paper estimated the cost of the new recruitments and incentives given to health workers and presented lessons for health workforce planning in future health emergencies towards health systems resilience. Between March and November 2020, 45 107 health workers were recruited, representing a 35% boost in the public sector health workforce capacity, and an increase in the recurrent public health sector wage bill by about GHS103 229 420 (US$17 798 176) per month, and about GHS1.24 billion (US$213.58 million) per annum. To incentivise the health workforce, the government announced a waiver of personal income taxes for all health workers in the public sector from April to December 2020 and offered a 50% additional allowance to some health workers. We estimate that the Government of Ghana spent about GH16.93 million (equivalent to US$2.92 million) monthly as COVID-19 response incentives, which translates into US$35 million by the end of 2020. Ghana invested considerably in health workforce recruitment and incentives to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an almost 37% increase in the public sector wage bill.

However, it remains unknown whether there is an association between BP and psychological time. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between time perspective (TP) and BP and the effect of TP on the relationship between BP and chronotype by examining a sample of college students pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 628 Chinese students (267 in pre-outbreak and 361 in post-outbreak) validly completed the Chinese version of the Bedtime Procrastination Scale, the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), and the MorningnessCEveningness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Students with more BP behaviors exhibited greater deviation from a balanced TP, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the past-negative and future orientations, as operationalized by the ZTPI, contributed independently to BP behaviors. The structural equation modeling analyses further demonstrated that morningness was significantly related to a more future-oriented TP, which in turn decreased BP in pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak samples, while morningness was associated with a less past-negative-oriented TP, which in turn decreased BP only in the post-COVID-19 outbreak sample. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that TP in students with BP predominantly focused on future orientation and that TP can mediate the relationship between chronotype and BP behaviors. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the time flow and change the role of chronotypeCTP in BP. These findings explain how individual differences in TP are associated with BP, which may be helpful in designing effective interventions to avoid BP, from the viewpoint of time perspective therapy.","output":"Time Perspective and Bedtime Procrastination: The Role of the ChronotypeCTime Perspective Relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children increasingly use mobile apps. Strategies to increase child engagement with apps include the use of gamification and images that incite fun and interaction, such as food. However, the foods and beverages that children are exposed to while using apps are unknown and may vary by app type. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the app content (ie, types of foods and beverages) included in nutrition-themed apps intended for children, to assess the use of game-like features, and to examine app characteristics such as overall quality and behavior change techniques (BCTs). METHODS: This analysis used a cross-sectional database of nutrition-themed apps intended for children (12 years), collected between May 2018 and June 2019 from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (n=259). Apps were classified into four types: food games or nongames that included didactic nutrition guides, habit trackers, and other. Food and beverages were identified in apps and classified into 16 food categories, as recommended (8/16, 50%) and as not recommended (8/16, 50%) by dietary guidelines, and quantified by app type. Binomial logistic regression assessed whether game apps were associated with foods and beverages not recommended by guidelines. App quality, overall and by subscales, was determined using the Mobile App Rating Scale. The BCT Taxonomy was used to classify the different behavioral techniques that were identified in a subsample of apps (124/259, 47.9%). RESULTS: A total of 259 apps displayed a median of 6 (IQR 3) foods and beverages. Moreover, 62.5% (162/259) of apps were classified as food games, 27.4% (71/259) as didactic nutrition guides, 6.6% (17/259) as habit trackers, and 3.5% (9/259) as other. Most apps (198/259, 76.4%) displayed at least one food or beverage that was not recommended by the dietary guidelines. Food game apps were almost 3 times more likely to display food and beverages not recommended by the guidelines compared with nongame apps (=2.8; P<.001). The overall app quality was moderate, with a median Mobile App Rating Scale score of 3.6 (IQR 0.7). Functionality was the subscale with the highest score (median 4, IQR 0.3). Nutrition guides were more likely to be educational and contain informative content on healthy eating (score 3.7), compared with the other app types, although they also scored significantly lower in engagement (score 2.3). Most apps (105/124, 84.7%) displayed at least one BCT, with the most common BCT being information about health consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest nutrition-themed apps intended for children displayed food and beverage content not recommended by dietary guidelines, with gaming apps more likely to display not recommended foods than their nongame counterparts. Many apps have a moderate app quality, and the use of consequences (instead of rewards) was the most common BCT.","output":"The Content, Quality, and Behavior Change Techniques in Nutrition-Themed Mobile Apps for Children in Canada: App Review and Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Long-term outcome is determined not only by the acute critical illness but increasingly by the reduced functional reserve of pre-existing frailty. The patients with frailty currently account for one-third of the critically ill, resulting in higher mortality.

Methods: In this prospective single-center cohort study at two interdisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital in Germany, the frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) in the adult patients with critical illness with an ICU stay >24 h. The functional status was assessed using the sum of the subdomains Mobility and Transfer of the Barthel Index (MTB) at three time points (pre-hospital, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge).

An early cascade of physical and structural damaging events starts immediately post-TBI. This primary injury event initiates a series of neuropathological molecular and biochemical secondary injury sequelae, that last much longer and involve disruption of cerebral metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and can lead to neuronal damage and death. Coupled to these events, recent studies have shown that lifestyle factors, including diet, constitute additional risk affecting TBI consequences and neuropathophysiological outcomes. There exists molecular cross-talk among the pathways involved in neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, and behavioral outcomes, that are shared among western diet (WD) intake and TBI pathophysiology. As such, poor dietary intake would be expected to exacerbate the secondary damage in TBI. Hence, the aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiological consequences of WD that can lead to the exacerbation of TBI outcomes. We dissect the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury in this context. We show that currently available data conclude that intake of a diet saturated in fats, pre- or post-TBI, aggravates TBI, precludes recovery from brain trauma, and reduces the response to treatment.","output":"Western diet aggravates neuronal insult in post-traumatic brain injury: Proposed pathways for interplay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nestled in an atmosphere that resembles a national park, the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz is fulfilling Harry Noller's vision of bringing together multidisciplinary researchers to solve problems that range from finding obscure RNAs to understanding the origin of life.","output":"RNA at Santa Cruz"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine whether an educational program on personal protective measures can reduce anxiety and depression in Hospital workers exposed to COVID-19.

This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. METHODS: Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15C17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. RESULTS: Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 emotion regulation abilities were at\\\\risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay\\\\at\\\\home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors.

Immunity credentials can be employed to permit movement of only a certain class of individuals that are least prone to spreading infections, thus reducing the risk for the society as a whole. While the authenticity of the immunity credentials is extremely critical, it is also important to guarantee privacy and confidentiality of the individuals' personal health information. In this paper, we present a blockchain based immunity credential system that allows users to authenticate immunity credentials in a verifiable manner. We leverage BLS aggregate signature that facilitates credential holders to selectively disclose credentials in a privacy preserving manner. Blockchain acts as single source of trust and ensures authenticity of claims. Our system enables users to reuse the tamper-evident verification status recorded on blockchain to authenticate to same verifiers without need for repeated cryptographic proof verification process. The protocol restricts any intermediaries/third-parties to use the identity or proof without authorization of the user. The protocol is fully automated through smart contracts and makes sure that credential verification is settled in near real time. We chose permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to implement our protocol as it befits the requirements of this problem and ensures smart contract development that supports user privacy, confidentiality, automated proof generation and verification of immunity credentials. ? 2022 IEEE.","output":"Privacy Enabled Immunity Credential System on Blockchain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life of Latin American orthopedic trauma surgeons during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. METHODS: A total of 400 orthopedic trauma surgeons from 14 Latin American countries were invited to complete an electronic survey aiming to understand the general situation of COVID-19 in each country and how COVID-19 had impacted life's participant financially and psychosocially. The relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the existence of legal regulations on the medical activity in the respondent's country, protocols for tracking the disease among patients hospitalized in an emergency basis due to skeletal trauma, and personal protective equipment to deal with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who need orthopedic trauma surgery was investigated, as well as the financial and psychosocial impact caused by the disease. Data was statistically analyzed with significance p < 0.05. RESULTS: 220 respondents completed the survey. 21 respondents were diagnosed with COVID-19. Local regulation was decisive in terms of increasing the risk for COVID-19 disease (p = 0.001). 91.8% of the respondents reported being concerned about their financial health and 57.7% described a state of feeling emotionally overextended. 75.0% believe that pandemic can change their professional activity. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America has negatively impacted the professional, financial, and psychosocial health of orthopedic trauma surgeons. It seems reasonable to state that the combination of psychosocial distress and deprivation together with financial uncertainty and decreased revenue can be straightly related to development of burnout symptoms among doctors.","output":"The hidden impact of rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in professional, financial, and psychosocial health of Latin American orthopedic trauma surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transitioning non-emergency, ambulatory medical care to virtual visits in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, has been a massive shift in philosophy and practice that naturally came with a steep learning curve for patients, physicians, and clinic administrators. It has been widely reported that virtual care adoption has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, but published data remain limited. To provide optimal, safe care during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, we need to understand the key factors associated with successful and less successful experiences of virtual care. This is particularly important for areas newer to virtual care such as specialty care. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a multi-method study to understand the key factors associated with successful and less successful experiences of virtual specialist care, particularly as they relate to patient experience of care. METHODS: This study was designed as a multi-method patient experience study using survey methods, descriptive qualitative interview methodology and administrative virtual care data collected by the hospital decision support team. Six specialty departments participated in the study (Endoscopy, Orthopaedics, Neurology, Haematology, Rheumatology and Gastroenterology). All patients who could speak and read English and attended a virtual specialist appointment in a participating clinic at St. Michael's Hospital between October 1, 2020, and January 30, 2021, were eligible to participate. RESULTS: In the study period, 51,702 virtual specialist visits were conducted in the departments which participated in the study. Of those, 96% were conducted by telephone and 4% by video. In both the survey and interview data there was an overall consensus that virtual care is a satisfying alternative to in-person care, with benefits such as reduced travel, cost, time, SARS-Co-V2 exposure, and increased convenience. Our analysis further revealed that the specific reason for the visit and the nature and status of the medical condition are important considerations in terms of guidance on where virtual care is most effective. Technology issues were not reported as a major challenge in our data given the majority of \\"virtual\\" visits reported by our participants were conducted by telephone, which is an important distinction. Despite the positive value of virtual care discussed by the majority of interview participants, 50% of survey respondents still indicated they would prefer to see their physician in person. CONCLUSIONS: Patient experience data from in this study indicates a high level of satisfaction with virtual specialty care but signals that there are nuances to be considered to ensure it is an appropriate and sustainable part of the standard of care.

This was largely made possible by major advances in the formulation technology for stabilized lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs). Design of the cationic ionizable lipids, which are a key component of the LNP formulations, with an acid dissociation constant (pKa) close to the early endosomal pH, would not only ensure effective encapsulation of mRNA into the stabilized lipoplexes within the LNPs, but also its subsequent endosomal release into the cytoplasm after endocytosis. Unlike other gene therapy modalities, which require nuclear delivery, the site of action for exogenous mRNA vaccines is the cytosol where they get translated into antigenic proteins and thereby elicit an immune response. LNPs also protect the mRNA against enzymatic degradation by the omnipresent ribonucleases (RNases).

The aim of this study is to describe how each LUS pattern correlates with patient vital signs and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of adult patients who presented to a large urban tertiary emergency department between May 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Patients were included in the study if they 1) presented with a respiratory chief complaint;2) met systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria;3) were confirmed to have COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR;and 4) had point-of-care LUS performed and recorded in our imaging storage database. All clinical data was reviewed using the hospital's electronic medical records. The study was approved through the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All LUS images were obtained by emergency medicine physicians during the patient's emergency department course and were considered adequate if they included a minimum of 4 lung fields (bilateral anterior and posterior fields). Images were reviewed by ultrasound fellowship trained emergency physicians who were blinded to patient clinical outcome data. Images were assessed for subpleural consolidations, B-lines, and merging B-lines. LUS patterns were measured against patient vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2) and inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, D-Dimer, Ferritin, LDH, Procalcitonin) that were collected on initial hospital presentation. Linear correlations were performed using Pearson's r coefficient. Statistical analysis was completed with SPSS. Statistical significance was set at p< 0.05. Results: A total of 39 patients were included in the study. There were 33 men and 6 women ranging in age between 23 and 77 years old with a mean age of 49 years. Conclusions: Subpleural consolidations were found to have a positive correlation with increasing respiratory rate (p=0.046) and ferritin levels (p=0.0016). An increasing percentage of intercostal spaces with B-lines and confluent B-lines had a positivenegative correlation with ferritin levels (SpO2 (p=0.0021).016, 0.034). LUS did not correlate with inflammatory biomarkers. Lastly, merging B-lines were found to have a positive correlation with D-Dimer (p= 0.013) and ferritin levels (p=0.0015). Subpleural consolidations, B-lines, and mergingconfluent B-lines appear to correlate with elevated ferritin, a marker that has been associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, subpleural consolidations were found to correlate with worse clinical and respiratory status. These LUS patterns may be manifestations of more severe lung injury and systemic pathophysiological processes that take place over the course of a COVID-19 infection., specifically SpO2. However, furthersurprisingly these common LUS findings did not correlate with inflammatory lab values, which some studies suggest may have prognostic value for patients with COVID.

Infection of humans with viruses for which we typically have little or no prior immunity, can result in epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. These epidemics can have public health and economic impact, and can exacerbate civil unrest or political instability.

Methods: The clinical data of 8 children with craniopharyngiomas who were surgically treated by neuroendoscopy through an extended endonasal approach in our center from 2018 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The related surgical approach and technique were evaluated to improve the surgical results and further reduce the surgical complications when removing craniopharyngioma in children. Results: All 8 patients achieved a gross-total resection of the tumor under neuroendoscopy. Postoperatively, 2 cases of transient hyperthermia and 4 cases of transient hyper- and/or hyponatremia occurred within the first 2 weeks, all of which were quickly controlled. Seven patients had symptoms of diabetes insipidus to varying degrees after the operation, and 4 of them improved within 1-3 months after surgery, but 3 cases still needed oral pituitrin. There were no cases of coma or death, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, or severe electrolyte imbalance after surgery. During the postoperative follow-up of 3 months to 2 years, no tumor recurrence was found. Among the 7 patients who suffered postoperative neuroendocrine deficiencies, 3 patients were found to be temporary during the follow-up, but 4 patients still required hormone replacement therapy. Particularly, postoperative visual deterioration and olfactory defect that occurred in patients were all improved during follow-up periods. In addition, 4 cases of obesity were noted at the last follow-up. Conclusions: Extended neuroendoscopic endonasal resection of craniopharyngiomas may be used as a safe and effective approach for children. Due to the poor pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus and worse compliance of treatment in children, surgical techniques of exposing the sellar region, removing the tumor, and reconstructing the skull base, as well as postoperative management of patients was proposed. However, due to the limited surgical cases in the study, the surgical safety and effects of the extended neuroendoscopic endonasal approach for children with craniopharyngiomas need to be further studied in the future.","output":"Extended Neuroendoscopic Endonasal Approach for Resection of Craniopharyngioma in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects persons living with HIV (PLWH) both directly (via morbidity/mortality) and indirectly (via disruption of HIV care).

Among the samples, 129 cases were positive; the majority of positive cases were from males (78.29%), 92.25% of whom were over 35 years old. Traditional drugs, like methamphetamine and opioids, accounted for most positive cases, and 27 of the abstinence cases with a use history of methamphetamine were still positive. In addition to abused drugs, like methamphetamine, morphine, and cocaine, the sedative hypnotic and psychotherapeutic drugs, including clonazepam, alprazolam, estazolam, zolpidem, and quetiapine, were detected in 26% of the hair samples, suggesting that these addicts may have insomnia and mental problems such as depression and psychosis, probably due to the long-term effects of drugs and withdrawal reactions. Three synthetic cannabinoids were also detected in 4 (2.7%) cases. A total of 37 cases were positive for methadone, tramadol, and dextromethorphan, reflecting a new trend of alternative drug use when traditional drugs were not easy to obtain during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"LC-MS/MS Determination of 88 Psychotropic Drugs in 1865 Hair Samples From Addicts in Drug Abstinence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its genome while spreading throughout the globe. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations by analyzing the host miRNA binding and virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, five host miRNAs which lost their affinity for targeting the viral genome, and another five can target the mutated viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mutations altering regulatory properties: deciphering host's and virus's perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to increase throughout the United States. Despite the rapid progression of the disease, there is limited information of the factors associated with mortality in Florida. This study aims to review the demographics, characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes of hospitalized patients, and their association with mortality. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A community-based tertiary-care hospital of Orlando Health, Orlando Regional Medical Center. Patients/Subjects: Data of hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020, at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Main data assessed included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, complications, outcomes, and inhospital mortality. The median age for hospitalized patients was 61 years;among them, 56% were males. Most were of African American (n = 288, 35.9%), Hispanic (n = 237, 29.6%), and Caucasian (n = 217, 27.1%) descent. More patients presented with symptoms developing at home (n = 589, 75.9%) than from skilled nursing and long-term acute care facilities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (42.8%), obesity (39.2%), lung disease (23.3%), coronary artery disease (20.2%), and congestive heart failure (18.3%). Complications with higher odds of mortality were mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 148.00, p &lt; 0.001), coinfections (odds ratio, 56.42, p &lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 84.01, p &lt; 0.001), atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 28.30, p &lt; 0.001), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 23.29, p &lt; 0.001), and acute venous thromboembolism (odds ratio, 26.43, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: We identified an increase of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 within older patients of African American and Hispanic descent with comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancer, liver disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may have helped avert mechanical ventilation, and this may have improved patient outcomes over the course of the study period.","output":"Characteristics, Comorbidities, Complications, and Outcomes Among 802 Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Community Hospital in Florida"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental health condition associated with high mortality rates and significantly impaired quality of life. National guidelines outline psychotherapeutic interventions as treatments of choice for adults with AN, but outcomes are limited and therapy drop-out high, resulting in calls for new innovative treatments. The Specialist Psychotherapy with Emotion for Anorexia in Kent and Sussex (SPEAKS) research programme sought to develop the SPEAKS intervention avoiding some difficulties inherent in development of earlier interventions, such unclear hypotheses about change processes. SPEAKS focuses on a core hypothesised maintaining factor (emotional experience) with clear proposed model of change. The current feasibility trial aims to provide an initial test of SPEAKS and inform design of a full randomised controlled trial protocol. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study employs a multisite, single-arm, within-group, mixed-methods design. Up to 60 participants (36 therapy completers) meeting inclusion criteria will be offered the SPEAKS intervention instead of treatment-as-usual (TAU). SPEAKS is a weekly psychotherapy lasting nine to 12 months, provided by trained and experienced eating disorders therapists. All other clinical input remains inline with TAU. Acceptability will be assessed using VAS scales and end of therapy interview. Reach and recruitment, such as recruitment yield, will be monitored. To support sample size estimation and economic estimation, data pertaining to eating disorder-related symptoms will be recorded every 3 months, alongside service usage and intervention-specific measures. Videoed therapy sessions will inform model adherence. Additional analyses coding videoed therapy will test SPEAKS change process hypotheses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by LondonCBromley Research Ethics Committee (NHS Rec Reference: 19/LO/1530). Data will be disseminated via high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (Open Access preferred), conferences, service user and charity networks (eg, UK charity BEAT) and through a free open conference hosted by National Health Service Trusts and Higher Education Institutions.

Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mice model with acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with [5-(p-Fluorophenyl)-2-ureido] thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1) that can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration, and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic plaque, rheumatoid arthritis and wound associated with skin.","output":"Calming Cytokine Storm in Pneumonia by Targeted Delivery of TPCA-1 Using Platelet-derived Extracellular Vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malnutrition and weight loss are highly prevalent in persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease may have a higher risk of infection of COVID-19 and worse outcomes than others. To improve the outcome during the pandemic, management strategies for the patients recovering from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery need to be reconsidered. Methods: Some precaution advices including self-protection, blood glucose and blood pressure controlling are recommended for the patients recovering from CABG during the pandemic. They are encouraged to communicate with doctors by telephone or Internet when COVID-19 related symptoms such as cough, fever and dyspnea occur. As a follow-up strategy for patients after CABG surgery, cardiac biomarkers and CTA could also be helpful to the diagnosis of COVID-19. Some medications being investigated for COVID-19 therapy may have side effects relevant to cardiovascular disease.

Often, there are subtle physiological differences in these cohorts of patients. In particular, in intensive care, patients tend to be younger and have increased disease severity. Data, to date, has combined outcomes from medical and intensive care cohorts, or looked exclusively at intensive care. We looked solely at the level 1 (medical) cohort to identify their clinical characteristics and predictors of outcome. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to a central London teaching hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from 23rd March to 7th April 2020 identified from the hospital electronic database. Any patients who required level 2 or 3 care were excluded. Results: A total of 229 patients were included for analysis. Increased age and frailty scores were associated with increased 30-day mortality. Reduced renal function and elevated troponin blood levels are also associated with poor outcome. Baseline observations showed that increased oxygen requirement was predictive for mortality. A trend of increased mortality with lower diastolic blood pressure was noted. Lymphopenia was not shown to be related to mortality. Conclusion: Urea and creatinine are the best predictors of mortality in the level 1 cohort. Unlike previous intensive care data, lymphopenia is not predictive of mortality. We suggest that these factors be considered when prognosticating and for resource allocation for the treatment and escalation of care for patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Infection Outside Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the original publication, one of the last paragraphs should have read as follows.","output":"Correction to: COVID-19 and heme oxygenase: novel insight into the disease and potential therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phage-display technology facilitates rapid selection of antigen-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies from large recombinant libraries. ScFv antibodies, composed of a VH and VL domain, are readily engineered into multimeric formats for the development of diagnostics and targeted therapies. However, the recombinant nature of the selection strategy can result in VH and VL domains with sub-optimal biophysical properties, such as reduced thermodynamic stability and enhanced aggregation propensity, which lead to poor production and limited application. We found that the C10 anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) scFv, and its affinity mutant, P2224, exhibit weak production from E. coli. Interestingly, these scFv contain a fusion of lambda3 and lambda1 V-region (LV3 and LV1) genes, most likely the result of a PCR aberration during library construction. To enhance the biophysical properties of these scFvs, we utilized a structure-based approach to replace and redesign the pre-existing framework of the VL domain to one that best pairs with the existing VH. We describe a method to exchange lambda sequences with a more stable kappa3 framework (KV3) within the VL domain that incorporates the original lambda DE-loop. The resulting scFvs, C10KV3_LV1DE and P2224KV3_LV1DE, are more thermodynamically stable and easier to produce from bacterial culture. Additionally, C10KV3_LV1DE and P2224KV3_LV1DE retain binding affinity to EGFR, suggesting that such a dramatic framework swap does not significantly affect scFv binding.

As a result, there is increasing interest in conducting randomised placebo-controlled trials in orthopaedic surgery. However, these frequently fail to reach recruitment targets suggesting a need to improve trial design to encourage participation. The objective of this study was to systematically scope the available evidence on patient and clinician values and preferences which may influence the decision to participate in placebo surgery trial. METHODS A systematic review was conducted via a literature search in the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and EconLit databases as of 19 July 2021, for studies of any design (except commentaries or opinion pieces) based on two key concepts: patient and clinician characteristics, values and preferences, and placebo surgery trials. RESULTS Of 3424 initial articles, we retained 18 eligible studies. Characteristics, preferences, values, and attitudes of patients (including levels of pain/function, risk/benefit perception, and altruism) and of clinicians (including concerns regarding patient deception associated with placebo, and experience/training in research) influenced their decisions to participate in placebo-controlled trials. Furthermore, some aspects of trial design, including randomisation procedures, availability of the procedure outside of the trial, and the information and consent procedures used, also influenced decisions to participate. CONCLUSION Participant recruitment is a significant challenge in placebo surgery trials, and individual decisions to participate appear to be sensitive to preferences around treatment. Understanding and quantifying the role patient and clinician preferences may play in surgical trials may contribute to the optimisation of the design and implementation of clinical trials in surgery.","output":"Patient and clinician characteristics and preferences for increasing participation in placebo surgery trials: a scoping review of attributes to inform a discrete choice experiment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>For many innovative organisations, Industry 4.0 paves the way for significant operational efficiencies, quality of goods and services and cost reductions.

Sadly, this interconnectivity between the enterprise information technology (IT) and industrial control systems (ICS) environment introduces new attack surfaces for critical infrastructure (CI) operators. As a result of the ICS cybersecurity risk introduced by the interconnectivity between the enterprise IT and ICS networks, the purpose of this study is to identify the cybersecurity capabilities that CI operators must have to attain good cybersecurity resilience.Design/methodology/approach>A scoping literature review of best practice international CI protection frameworks, standards and guidelines were conducted. Similar cybersecurity practices from these frameworks, standards and guidelines were grouped together under a corresponding National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework (CF) practice. Practices that could not be categorised under any of the existing NIST CF practices were considered new insights, and therefore, additions.Findings>A CI cybersecurity capability framework comprising 29 capability domains (cybersecurity focus areas) was developed as an adaptation of the NIST CF with an added dimension. This added dimension emphasises cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) security. Each of the 29 cybersecurity capability domains is executed through various capabilities (cybersecurity processes and procedures). The study found that each cybersecurity capability can further be operationalised by a set of cybersecurity controls derived from various frameworks, standards and guidelines, such as COBIT?, CIS?, ISA/IEC 62443, ISO/IEC 27002 and NIST Special Publication 800-53.Practical implications>CI sectors are immediately able to adopt the CI cybersecurity capability framework to evaluate their levels of resilience against cyber-attacks, given new attack surfaces introduced by the interconnectivity of cyber-connected things between the enterprise and ICS levels.Originality/value>The authors present an added dimension to the NIST framework for CI cyber protection.

Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5 to 3 folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.","output":"Prediction of RNA Pseudoknots Using Heuristic Modeling with Mapping and Sequential Folding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contaminated surfaces are a major source of nosocomial infection. To reduce microbial bioburden and surface-based transmission of infectious disease, the use of antibacterial and self-sanitizing surfaces, such as copper (Cu), is being explored in clinical settings. Cu has long been known to have antimicrobial activity. However, Gram-positive microorganisms, a class that includes pathogens commonly responsible for hospital-acquired infection such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile, are more resilient to its biocidal effect. Inspired by inherently bactericidal nanostructured surfaces found in nature, we have developed an improved Cu coating, engineered to contain nanoscale surface features and thus increase its antibacterial activity against a broader range of organisms. In addition, we have established a new method for facilitating the rapid and continuous release of biocidal metal ions from the coating, through incorporation of an antibacterial metal salt (ZnCl2) with a lower reduction potential than Cu. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was used to fabricate our coatings, which serves as a low-cost and scalable route for modifying existing conductive surfaces with complex shape. By tuning both the surface morphology and chemistry, we were able to create a nanocomposite Cu coating that decreased the microbial bioburden of Gram-positive S.aureus by 94% compared to unmodified Cu. Table of Contents Antimicrobial copper (Cu) products are being deployed in clinical settings to decrease microbial bioburden and prevent surface-based transmission of infectious disease.

As a socially influential young group, university students awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine are crucial to achieving herd immunity. This study aimed to assess the awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese university students and identify possible factors associated with their awareness level and vaccine hesitancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese university students between 10 and 28 June 2021. We collected information on the demographic characteristics, awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, and influencing factors. Sleep disturbances and anxiety disorders were also evaluated. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among the 721 participants (aged 18 to 23 years) with a female predominance (68.9%), 40.4% of cases exhibited moderate awareness the COVID-19 vaccine, and 87.4% of cases expressed high acceptance of the vaccine. Participants awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with gender, ethnicity, region of residence, grade level, satisfaction with current state of pandemic control, the perceived likelihood of a COVID-19 pandemic rebound, the source number of COVID-19 information, concerns about differences in vaccine manufacturers, acceptance of current state-approved vaccines and insomnia level. Furthermore, age, preferred channels for vaccination and the acceptance of current state-approved vaccines were significantly associated with their acceptance of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: This study reflected Chinese university students high acceptance, but insufficient awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine, some students have insomnia and anxiety problems. These require the government to take measures such as individualized publicity and education, adding professional psychological counseling courses to improve the university students awareness of vaccines and public health events, and comprehensively promote vaccination to cope with the ever-changing situation of the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Chinese University Students Awareness and Acceptance of the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Ward rounds are sometimes the only opportunity for patients to discuss medication. Patient and professional feedback on an acute male inpatient ward in South London highlighted a demand for more medication information outside the formal ward round setting. We aimed to have 100% of patients meet our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing on the ward by March 2021. To fulfil criteria, all patients are offered: (1) ward round discussion, (2) written patient information leaflets (PILs), (3) informal discussion groups, all regarding medication. The principles of this quality improvement project (QIP) were drawn from definitions of patient-centred care and standards of good practice;patients should have access to a variety of information formats, relevant to the individual, and the knowledge gained empowers patients. Patient experience data revealed that 30% of clients answered passively to the question, Do you feel involved in your care? We hypothesized that medication discussion groups positively impact patients wellbeing, by providing a safe space that facilitates conversation surrounding medication issues. Method We conducted weekly audits on patients whose admission duration was >7 days, and recorded fulfilment of the above criteria. At week 1, we introduced a program of weekly medication discussion groups led by members of the wider multi-disciplinary team covering a broad topic range. At week 6, we developed a rolling rota of the discussion groups and posters were displayed in advance. At week 14, all patients were offered PILs through a 1:1 interaction and this continued as routine practice. Medication discussion group feedback was obtained via questionnaires and The Blob Tree, a psycho-emotional assessment tool commonly used in healthcare settings. Result In 19 weeks, the median percentage of patients who fulfilled our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing was 92.86%. After 11 medication discussion groups, 79.3% of questionnaire responders wanted further sessions. 88% of The Blob Tree responses collected inferred a positive emotional response after the group discussions and half of those noticed an improvement in their emotional state. Conclusion This QIP was overall a success;it fulfilled a requirement to meet good standards in information sharing and became embedded in the fabric of the ward, continuing to run as part of the activities program. It demonstrated the impact of education on patients mental wellbeing through empowerment and peer support. As a by-product it established multidisciplinary connections and improved therapeutic relationships.

Restricting calorie and protein intakes seemed beneficial, suggesting a role for metabolic pathways such as autophagy, a potential key mechanism in safeguarding cellular integrity, notably in the muscle, during critical illness. However, the optimal calorie and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3 will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding. We hypothesised that nutritional support with calorie and protein restriction during acute critical illness decreased day 90 mortality and/or dependency on intensive care unit (ICU) management in mechanically ventilated patients receiving vasoactive amine therapy for shock, compared with standard calorie and protein targets. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: NUTRIREA-3 is a randomised, controlled, multicentre, open-label trial comparing two parallel groups of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive amine therapy for shock and given early nutritional support according to one of two strategies: early calorie-protein restriction (6 kcal/kg/day-0.2-0.4 g/kg/day) or standard calorie-protein targets (25 kcal/kg/day, 1.0-1.3 g/kg/day) at the acute phase defined as the first 7 days in the ICU.

The ROS produce damaging effects on the cell membrane and contribute to skeletal muscle damage. Selenium (Se), a natural mineral trace element, is an essential component of selenoproteins that plays an important role in antioxidant defense. The activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a highly-efficient antioxidant enzyme, is closely dependent on the presence of Se. These properties of Se may be potentially applicable to improve athletic performance and training recovery. We systematically searched for published studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Se supplementation on antioxidant defense system, muscle performance, hormone response, and athletic performance among physically active individuals. We used the Preferred Reporting Elements for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and searched in SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and PubMed databases to identify published studies until March 2020. The systematic review incorporated original studies with randomized controlled crossover or parallel design in which intake of Se administered once a day was compared with the same placebo conditions. No exclusions were applied for the type of physical exercise performed, the sex, nor the age of the participants. Among 150 articles identified in the search, 6 met the criteria and were included in the systematic review. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the McMaster Critical Review Form. Oral Se supplementation with 180 g/day or 240 g/day (selenomethionine) and 200 g/day (Sodium Selenite), significantly decreased lipid hydroperoxide levels and increased GPx in plasma, erythrocyte, and muscle. No significant effects were observed on athletic performance, testosterone hormone levels, creatine kinase activity, and exercise training-induced adaptations on oxidative enzyme activities or on muscle fiber type myosin heavy chain expression. In addition, Se supplementation showed to have a dampening effect on the mitochondria changes in chronic and acute exercise. In summary, the use of Se supplementation has no benefits on aerobic or anaerobic athletic performance but it may prevent Se deficiencies among athletes with high-intensity and high-volume training. Optimal Se plasma levels may be important to minimize chronic exercise-induced oxidative effects and modulate the exercise effect on mitochondrial changes.","output":"The Role of Selenium Mineral Trace Element in Exercise: Antioxidant Defense System, Muscle Performance, Hormone Response, and Athletic Performance.

To measure the impact of VCA on student outcomes in a dissection laboratory, this study compared student attitudes, quiz scores, dissection quality and accuracy, and instructor reliance between students with and without access to VCA. Students with VCA needed less time with teaching assistants (P < 0.01), asked teaching assistants fewer questions (P = 0.04), felt that the dissection was easier (P = 0.02), and were in stronger agreement that they had access to adequate resources (P = 0.02). No differences were found in the dissection quality or accuracy, quiz scores, or attitudes regarding overall enjoyment of the activity between the two groups. This study shows that VCA increases student independence and can be used to enhance anatomical instruction.","output":"Enhancing Anatomical Instruction: Impact of a Virtual Canine Anatomy Program on Student Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On May 11, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges released recommendations discouraging in-person activities for away rotations and mandating virtual-only residency recruitment interviews.

Much of this negative impact did not result from the disease itself, but from the lockdown restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus. We investigate how national stock market indices reacted to the news of national lockdown restrictions in the period from January to May 2020. We find that lockdown restrictions led to different reactions in our sample of OECD and BRICS countries: there was a general negative effect resulting from the increase in lockdown restrictions, but we find strong evidence for underreaction during the lockdown announcement, followed by some overreaction that is corrected subsequently. This under-/overreaction pattern, however, is observed mostly during the first half of our time series, pointing to learning effects. Relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, on the other hand, had a positive effect on markets only during the second half of our sample, while for the first half of the sample, the effect is negative.","output":"Stock market reactions to COVID-19 lockdown: A global analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Currently, the world is facing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, coronavirus of acute respiratory distress syndrome 2, causes of COVID-19. Coronaviruses are RNA single-stranded viruses that have an envelope. In addition, coronaviruses are classified into four subfamilies: alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. The first of them, cause mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, while beta-coronaviruses are responsible for severe diseases. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the group of beta-coronaviruses. Current available therapies use corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, non-specific antiviral drugs or antibiotics in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections. In addition, therapies based on the use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesvir, ribavirin, interferon or lopinavir-ritonavir were also initially used. Mesenchemical stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in cell therapies, which include both basic research and clinical trials. Their exceptional effectiveness and safety have been confirmed and documented in many clinical studies, which include a number of inflammatory diseases involving the immune system - one of them is systemic lupus erythematosus. Available data indicate the ability to differentiate MSCs and their immunomodulatory effects. In addition, through interactions with immune cells, which include, but are not limited to, macrophages and dendritic cells, or paracrine secretion, MSCs are able to secrete a number of types of cytokines. MSCs are also characterized by tissue regeneration and regulation of inflammation. Due to their properties, researchers turned to determine whether MSC transplantation is able to improve the outcome of patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. The presented review provides not only new knowledge in the field of molecular mechanisms of pro-regenerative action of stem cells, but also have the potential to open up new prospects of action to improve lung tissue regeneration in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in review mentioned about clinical trials using MSCs with a complete status, as well as the latest discoveries in molecular biology, a platform model of pluripotent stem cells in the SARS-CoV-2 study on 3D animal models and nanoconjugates based on stem cells.Funding: MGP acknowledges support fromthe Iuventus Plus project of Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education No IP 2015 022074.

The clinician's perception of inappropriateness is more reliant on clinical judgment. Earlier consultation with families before ICU admission and patient education on the outcomes of life-sustaining therapies may help reconcile these providerCpatient disagreements. However, global emergencies like COVID-19 change the usual paradigm of end-of-life care, as it is a new disease with only scarce predictive information about it. Pandemics can also bring about the burdensome predicament of doctors having to make unwanted choices of rationing access to the ICU when demand for otherwise life-saving resources exceeds supply. Evidence-based prognostic checklists may guide treatment triage but the principles of shared decision-making are unchanged. Yet, they need to be altered with respect to COVID-19, defining likely outcomes and likelihood of benefit for the patient, and clarifying their willingness to take on the risks inherent to being in an ICU for 2 weeks for those eligible. For patients who are admitted during the prodrome of COVID-19 disease, or those who deteriorate in the second week, clinicians have some lead time in hospital to have appropriate discussions about ceilings of treatments offered based on severity. KEY POINTS: The patient and family perspective on inappropriateness of intensive care at the end of life often differs from the clinician's opinion due to the nonmedical frame of mind. To improve satisfaction with communication on treatment goals, consultation on patient values and inclusion of social constructs in addition to clinical prediction is a good start to reconcile differences between physician and health service users viewpoints. During pandemics, where health systems may collapse, different admission criteria driven by the need to ration services may be warranted. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To explore the extent to which older patients and their families are involved in decisions about appropriateness of intensive care admission or treatments. To understand how patients or their families define inappropriate intensive care admission or treatments. To reflect on the implications of decision to admit or not to admit to the intensive care unit in the face of acute resource shortages during a pandemic.","output":"Appropriateness of intensive care treatments near the end of life during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose or Objective: Patients with financial toxicity (FT) have a lower quality of life and survival. In Japan, although the universal health insurance system has provided comprehensive coverage to all Japanese citizens, FT is increasingly recognized as an adverse outcome of cancer treatment. The poverty rate for elderly Japanese women is increasing;however, the FT of cancer treatment has been poorly studied in Japan. The comprehensive score for FT (COST) questionnaire is a tool to measure FT. In our study, we examined COST questionnaire among adult Japanese women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Patients who were aged >18, had stage ICIII A breast cancer, and received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy were eligible for the study. In addition to COST survey, socioeconomic characteristics were determined using a questionnaire and medical records. Results: All 17 patients we approached (100%) responded to the questionnaire. The median COST score was 17 (range, 9C38). Ten (59%) and five (29%) patients suffered grade 1 FT (COST score, 14C25) and grade 2 FT (COST score, 1C13), respectively. On univariant analyses, part-time job (P = .03), and lower household savings (P < .001) were negatively associated with COST score. Lower household income (P = .12) and use of strategies to cope with the cost of cancer care expenses (included using savings) to pay for cancer treatment (P = .13) did not show statistically significant associations. Conclusion: Our preliminary data showed that despite the existing universal health insurance system, some Japanese women experienced meaningful financial toxicity during radiotherapy. This is a preliminary report with a small number of patients before COVID-19 era. COVID-19 has the potential to affect patients economically.

This study explored trajectories of anxiety in parents of children and young people (CYP) with rheumatic diseases and adults with rheumatic diseases in the six months following March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods CYP and adults recruited to the international COVID-19 European Patient Registry, a parent-led, online, self-referred prospective cohort recruiting participants globally, were selected if enrolled within 20(th) March to 17th April 2020. Anxiety scores (0-10, 10=Highest anxiety) were collected weekly for up to 28 weeks and denoted parent anxiety in the CYP cohort and self-reported anxiety in the adult cohort. Group-based trajectory models explored anxiety clusters using censored-normal models in the CYP and adult populations, separately. Linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials were tested within 1 to 10 clusters and optimal models selected based on a combination of model fit (BIC), parsimony and clinical plausibility. Demographic (country, age, gender) and clinical (diagnosis, disease control, respiratory comorbidity, immunosuppressive therapy) information and COVID-19 mitigation behaviours (isolation, distancing, none) were collected at initial enrolment and compared between clusters using Chi-squared, Fishers exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results Among 498 CYP and 2640 adults, most were female (65%, 89%) and from the UK (50%, 84%), respectively. The most common diagnoses were polyarticular JIA (37%) and oligoarticular JIA (29%) among CYP and RA among the adults (63%). Respiratory comorbidities were uncommon in the CYP (10%) and adult (17%) cohorts, and most were taking any immunosuppressive therapies (85%, 87%), respectively. As of March 2020, 88% and 79% were self-isolating, respectively. In both the parents of CYP and adult cohorts, four trajectory clusters were identified with similar patterns: Persistent extremely high anxiety (32%, 17%), persistent high anxiety (43%, 41%), high anxiety that marginally improved (25%, 32%) and moderate anxiety that improved (11%, 10%). Among CYP, few characteristics distinguished the clusters. However, in the adult cohort, clusters with greater and more persistent anxiety were associated with higher levels of respiratory comorbidities, higher use of immunosuppressive therapies, higher initial levels of self-isolation and slightly older age than those with lower or improving anxiety over time. Conclusion This study reports four trajectories of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic that are consistent across parents of CYP with rheumatic diseases and among adults with these conditions. Despite relatively lower risks for CYP, parental anxiety regarding COVID-19 was high and not associated with characteristics of their child or of their child's disease. Among adults with rheumatic diseases, greater anxiety was associated with risk factors potentially associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Disclosure S.J.W. Shoop-Worrall: None. S.M.M.

This paper describes the impact of sedentarism on the human body at the level of the muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and nervous systems and is based on evidence from several models of inactivity, including bed rest, unilateral limb suspension, and step-reduction. Data form these studies show that muscle wasting occurs rapidly, being detectable within two days of inactivity. This loss of muscle mass is associated with fibre denervation, neuromuscular junction damage and upregulation of protein breakdown, but is mostly explained by the suppression of muscle protein synthesis. Inactivity also affects glucose homeostasis as just few days of step reduction or bed rest, reduce insulin sensitivity, principally in muscle. Additionally, aerobic capacity is impaired at all levels of the O2 cascade, from the cardiovascular system, including peripheral circulation, to skeletal muscle oxidative function. Positive energy balance during physical inactivity is associated with fat deposition, associated with systemic inflammation and activation of antioxidant defences, exacerbating muscle loss. Importantly, these deleterious effects of inactivity can be diminished by routine exercise practice, but the exercise dose-response relationship is currently unknown. Nevertheless, low to medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise, easily implementable in home-settings, will have positive effects, particularly if combined with a 15-25% reduction in daily energy intake. This combined regimen seems ideal for preserving neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular health.Highlights This paper describes the impact of sedentarism, caused by the COVID-19 home confinement on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine systems.Just few days of sedentary lifestyle are sufficient to induce muscle loss, neuromuscular junction damage and fibre denervation, insulin resistance, decreased aerobic capacity, fat deposition and low-grade systemic inflammation.Regular low/medium intensity high volume exercise, together with a 15-25% reduction in caloric intake are recommended for preserving neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine health.","output":"Impact of sedentarism due to the COVID-19 home confinement on neuromuscular, cardiovascular and metabolic health: Physiological and pathophysiological implications and recommendations for physical and nutritional countermeasures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapidly expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, there is concern that solid organ transplant recipients will be particularly vulnerable to infection and may experience a more severe clinical course.

Angstrom-level control over single-digit nanopore size (1.4-2.0 nm) is achieved by direct integration of variable-length monomers. We apply these techniques to fabricate a series of large-area 2D COF membranes with variable thicknesses, pore sizes, and supporting materials.

For organic solvent nanofiltration, the 2D COF membranes demonstrate an order-of-magnitude greater permeance than the state-of-the-art commercial polymeric membrane. We apply continuum models to quantify the dominance of pore passage resistance to mass transport over pore entrance resistance. A strong linear correlation between single-digit nanopore tortuosity and 2D COF thickness enables solvent fluxes to be predicted directly from solvent viscosity and COF membrane properties.

In this paper, for the fault geometry of the Ms 7.0 earthquake in Lushan, the geometric parameters of the planar fault are inverted based on the rectangular dislocation model using GPS coseismic displacement data, and on this basis, a curved fault steeply-dipping on top and gently-dipping at depth is constructed by combining the aftershock distribution.

While some similarities exist between countries, this manuscript will focus on five differences that impact palliative care for cancer patients including the epidemiology of cancer and related symptoms, cancer-specific integration into care, palliative care education, economic development of the country, and cultural and religious differences. RECENT FINDINGS: The epidemiology of cancer varies around the world resulting in variable symptoms and the need for individualized approaches to palliative care. While palliative care is integrated in some countries, it is lacking in over half of the world, and specific integration into cancer care is virtually absent. Education and training are the key to expansion, and yet oncology-focused palliative care education is lacking or is not well-reported in the literature. To complicate this global lens even further are the economic disparities that exist. Low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) are resource poor and have the fewest resources and least amount of integration, and yet patients with advanced cancer are over-represented in these countries. Essential to cancer-related palliative care is a tailored approach that addresses cultural and religious differences around the globe. SUMMARY: Palliative care is developing around the globe and yet palliative care specific for cancer patients is in its infancy. Cancer care professionals should (1) understand the epidemiologic differences that exist globally and the impact this has on palliative care, (2) integrate palliative care into the cancer care arena, (3) provide cancer-specific palliative education focused on the cancer trajectory from diagnosis through survivorship and end of life, (4) advocate for LMICs, which suffer from a lack of resources and services, and (5) understand cultural and religious differences that exist to provide holistic and sensitive cancer-related palliative care.","output":"Global Perspectives on Palliative Care for Cancer Patients: Not All Countries Are the Same"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This pilot randomized clinical trial evaluates the increased uptake and acceptability of a text-based model for home blood pressure monitoring compared with online portal use among Black patients with Medicaid and Medicare insurance who have hypertension and cardiovascular disease.","output":"Evaluation of Online Patient Portal vs Text-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring Among Black Patients With Medicaid and Medicare Insurance Who Have Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety and distress in young people worldwide It is important that mental health is prioritized during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects on young people, families and society Mental health and wellbeing apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have the potential to improve equity of service access OBJECTIVE: Objective: The 'Whitu-7 ways in 7 days' wellbeing app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic The aim of this study is two-fold: (1) to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and (2) to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental/emotional wellbeing and reducing depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand young people METHODS: Methods: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of Maori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4-weeks and 3-months RESULTS: Results: The study received ethics approval in May 2020 and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020 Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in September 2020 Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and online communities Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021 and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021 Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between group differences in psychological outcomes CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, scalable mental health interventions to address the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic This study will develop and test an evidence-based wellbeing app, which if effective, could be made available to all young people in New Zealand and internationally CLINICALTRIAL: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12620000516987)","output":"A Coping Skills Mobile App to Support the Emotional Wellbeing of Young People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged periods of forced social isolation is detrimental to well-being, yet we know little about which genes regulate susceptibility to its effects. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, social isolation induces stark changes in behavior including increased aggression, locomotor activity, and resistance to ethanol sedation. To identify genes regulating sensitivity to isolation, I screened a collection of sixteen hundred P-element insertion lines for mutants with abnormal levels of all three isolation-induced behaviors. The screen identified three mutants whose affected genes are likely central to regulating the effects of isolation in flies. One mutant, sex pistol (sxp), became extremely aggressive and resistant to ethanol sedation when socially isolated. sxp also had a high level of maleCmale courtship. The mutation in sxp reduced the expression of two minor isoforms of the actin regulator hts (adducin), as well as mildly reducing expression of CalpA, a calcium-dependent protease. As a consequence, sxp also had increased expression of the insulin-like peptide, dILP5. Analysis of the social behavior of sxp suggests that these minor hts isoforms function to limit isolation-induced aggression, while chronically high levels of dILP5 increase maleCmale courtship.","output":"A genetic screen for Drosophila social isolation mutants and analysis of sex pistol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wild mammalian species, including bats, constitute the natural reservoir of Betacoronavirus (including SARS, MERS, and the deadly SARS-CoV-2). Different hosts or host tissues provide different cellular environments, especially different antiviral and RNA modification activities that can alter RNA modification signatures observed in the viral RNA genome. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides and recruits other proteins to degrade a variety of viral RNA genomes. Many mammalian RNA viruses have evolved CpG deficiency. Increasing CpG dinucleotides in these low-CpG viral genomes in the presence of ZAP consistently leads to decreased viral replication and virulence. Because ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression, viruses infecting different tissues are expected to have different CpG signatures, suggesting a means to identify viral tissue-switching events. I show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency in all known Betacoronavirus genomes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (Alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the canine tissue infected by the canine coronavirus may provide a cellular environment strongly selecting against CpG.

Especially, deep learning algorithms have been adopted in several studies and promising results have been obtained. However, the cross-domain fault diagnostic problem still remains a challenging issue, where the training and testing data are collected from different operating conditions of the machine. To bridge the domain gap in the training and testing data and increase the model generalization ability, a domain adaptation approach is proposed in this paper within the deep learning framework. Multiple convolutional operations are employed for automatic feature extraction. The maximum mean discrepancy is used to optimize the distributions of the learned features for accurate diagnosis. To further enhance the model generalization ability, the health condition labels of the data are injected with additional noise during model training. Experiments on a bearing fault diagnosis dataset are carried out for validation. The results show that, compared with the popular transfer learning algorithms, the proposed method with noisy health labels can successfully improve the cross-domain diagnosis performance on rotating machines.","output":"Enhancing Intelligent Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis Performance on Rotating Machines with Noisy Health Labels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing interest in harnessing aged care residents' perspectives to drive quality improvement in aged care homes.

Younger age, female, and lower household income were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than older age, male, and higher household income.

Asians experienced lower prevalence compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Two practical implications are offered. First, the economic sequelae of COVID-19 impact psychological distress even when the community infection rate is stable. Second, disparities in psychosocial distress demonstrate that social and economic resources are needed by social groups such as young adults, females, and racial/ethnic minorities that have experienced the highest impact.

Electrophysiology studies may reproduce the SVT, distinguish it from other life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and exclude other causes of syncope.

Accurate clinical characterisation studies are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts, particularly early in a pandemic. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included. Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature may be underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults.

Significant changes in R(t) can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring R(t) reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates R(t) using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant R(t) changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in R(t), and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example.

Given that current phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 identifies new viral clades after they exhibit evolutionary selections, one wonders whether we can identify the viral selection and predict the emergence of new viral clades? Inspired by the Kolmogorov complexity concept, we propose a generative complexity (algorithmic) framework capable to analyze the viral RNA sequences by mapping the multiscale nucleotide dependencies onto a state machine, where states represent subsequences of nucleotides and state-transition probabilities encode the higher order interactions between these states. We apply computational learning and classification techniques to identify the active state-transitions and use those as features in clade classifiers to decipher the transient mutations (still evolving within a clade) and stable mutations (typical to a clade). As opposed to current analysis tools that rely on the edit distance between sequences and require sequence alignment, our method is computationally local, does not require sequence alignment and is robust to random errors (substitution, insertions and deletions).

Most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoVancestors may be found in OldWorld bats of the Vespertilionidae family. After a proposed bat to camel switching event, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is likely to have been the result of multiple zoonotic transfers from dromedary camels. Human-to-human transmission appears to require close contact with infected persons, with outbreaks mainly occurring in hospital environments. Outbreaks have been associated with inadequate infection prevention and control implementation, resulting in recommendations on basic and more advanced infection prevention and control measures by the World Health Organization, and issuing of government guidelines based on these recommendations in affected countries including Saudi Arabia. Evolutionary changes in the virus, particularly in the viral spike protein which mediates virus-host cell contact may potentially increase transmission of this virus. Efforts are on-going to identify specific evidence-based therapies or vaccines. The broad-spectrum antiviral nitazoxanide has been shown to have in vitro activity against MERS-CoV.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the endothelium represents the Achilles' heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2 overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1 and TNF-, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression.

The theory suggests that this association follows a U-shape. It posits that at low levels of video gaming time, video gaming displaces gun-related behaviors and shelters adolescents by keeping them occupied and by reducing opportunities and motivation to acquire guns. However, at some level of gaming time (because most popular games adolescents play include violent aspects), the assumed imprinting of aggressive behaviors overpowers the positive displacement force, and this can trivialize and naturalize gun-carrying behaviors, and ultimately increase motivation to obtain and carry guns. I tested this theory with two national samples of American adolescents (n1 = 24,779 and n2 = 26,543, out of which 403 and 378, respectively, reported bringing a gun to school in the last month).

METHODS: This study is a case-control study including 53 patients with COVID-19 and 40 healthy volunteers. COVID-19 severity was divided into three groups: asymptomatic, mild and severe. We measured the same set of antibody titers for vaccine antigens, and a set of biochemical and infection markers, in both the case and control groups.

CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were associated with the disease severity of COVID-19, and elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 were related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, which could be used to evaluate COVID-19 patients' disease severity and prognosis.","output":"Associations between Serum Interleukins (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) and Disease Severity of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the UK, early work on paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) was conducted by John Dacie who, at the Hammersmith Hospital, first hypothesised that the PNH abnormality might arise through a somatic mutation; and who outlined with S.M. Lewis the relationship between PNH and aplastic anaemia. When the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis Class A (PIGA) gene was identified by Taroh Kinoshita's group, jointly with him the Hammersmith group proved that PNH is caused in most patients by a single somatic mutation in the PIGA gene. At the same time, after Bruno Rotoli had spent a sabbatical at the Hammersmith, the 'immune escape model' for the pathogenesis of PNH was developed. Early this century, Peter Hillmen, formerly at the Hammersmith and now in Leeds, spearheaded the use of the complement-blocking (anti-C5) antibody eculizumab. This new medicine radically changed the management and the clinical course of patients with PNH. Recently a derivative of eculizumab with more favourable pharmacokinetics has been introduced. In view of the fact that these agents are associated with C3-dependent extravascular haemolysis, it is important that a number of inhibitors of the proximal complement pathway are now in the offing and may further improve the life of patients with PNH.","output":"Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH): novel therapies for an ancient disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children (less than 19 years) account for 20% of the US population but currently represent less than 2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Because infected children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in children is poorly understood. METHODS During the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood samples from 812 individuals from a Childrens Hospital were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical records were compared with local COVID-19 cases. RESULTS In total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11 years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test. Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish. CONCLUSION In a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location, race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported and may have contributed to virus transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Rates of Children in Louisiana During the State Stay at Home Order."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although nasopharyngeal samples have been considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, variability in viral load across different anatomical sites could cause nasopharyngeal samples to be less sensitive than saliva or nasal samples in certain cases. Self-collected samples have logistical advantages over nasopharyngeal samples, making them amenable to population-scale screening. To evaluate sampling alternatives for population screening, we collected nasopharyngeal, saliva, and nasal samples from two cohorts with varied levels and types of symptoms. In a mixed cohort of 60 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, we found that saliva had 88% concordance with nasopharyngeal samples when tested in the same testing lab (n = 41) and 68% concordance when tested in different testing labs (n = 19). In a second cohort of 20 participants hospitalized for COVID-19, saliva had 74% concordance with nasopharyngeal samples tested in the same testing lab but detected virus in two participants that tested negative with nasopharyngeal samples on the same day. Medical record review showed that the saliva-based testing sensitivity was related to the timing of symptom onset and disease stage. We find that no sample site will be perfectly sensitive for COVID-19 testing in all situations, and the significance of negative results will always need to be determined in the context of clinical signs and symptoms. Saliva retained high clinical sensitivity for early-stage and presymptomatic COVID-19 while allowing easier collection, minimizing the exposure of health care workers, and need for personal protective equipment and making it a viable option for population-scale testing. IMPORTANCE Methods for COVID-19 detection are necessary for public health efforts to monitor the spread of disease. Nasopharyngeal samples have been considered the best approach for COVID-19 testing. However, alternative samples like self-collected saliva offer advantages for population-scale screening. Meta-analyses of recent studies suggest that saliva is useful for detecting SARS-CoV-2; however, differences in disease prevalence, sample collection, and analysis methods still confound strong conclusions on the utility of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal samples. Here, we find that the sensitivity of saliva testing is related to both the timing of the sample collection relative to symptom onset and the disease stage. Importantly, several clinical vignettes in our cohorts highlight the challenges of medical decision making with limited knowledge of the associations between laboratory test data and the natural biology of infection.","output":"Saliva Testing Is Accurate for Early-Stage and Presymptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous health-related issues continue to undermine the health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people living with HIV (PLHIV). We developed a clinic screening tool (CST-HIV) for the purpose of identifying these issues in routine specialist clinical care in Spain. METHODS: We used the following established instrument development procedures: (1) a literature review; (2) four focus group discussions (FGDs), two that convened 16 expert HIV care providers, and two that convened 15 PLHIV; (3) prioritisation, selection and definition of constructs (health-related issues) to include in the CST-HIV and drafting of initial item pool; and (4) a pilot study to analyse psychometric properties and validity of items and to determine which to retain in the final CST-HIV. The FGD interview scripts incorporated an exercise to prioritise the health-related issues perceived to have the greatest negative effect on HRQoL. The online questionnaire used for the pilot study included the pool of CST-HIV items and validated measures of each construct. RESULTS: We identified 68 articles that reported on factors associated with the HRQoL of PLHIV. The most burdensome health-related issues identified in the FGDs related to stigma, socioeconomic vulnerability, sleep/fatigue, pain, body changes, emotional distress, and sexuality. Based on the literature review and FGD findings, we selected and defined the following constructs to include in the initial CST-HIV: anticipated stigma, emotional distress, sexuality, social support, material deprivation, sleep/fatigue, cognitive problems, and physical symptoms. Two researchers wrote six to eight items for each construct. Next, 18 experts rated 47 items based on their clarity, relevance, and representativeness. Pilot testing was carried out with 226 PLHIV in Spain. We retained 24 items based on empirical criteria that showed adequate psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the eight-factor structure with a good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.035, AGFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.99). We found strong positive correlations between the instruments eight dimensions and validated measures of the same constructs. Likewise, we found negative associations between the dimensions of the CST-HIV and HRQoL. CONCLUSION: The CST-HIV is a promising tool for use in routine clinical care to efficiently identify and address health-related issues undermining the HRQoL of PLHIV.","output":"Development of a Clinic Screening Tool to Identify Burdensome Health-Related Issues Affecting People Living With HIV in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beaches of East Africa are the place to relax, but when contaminated with animal faeces, they are a likely source of health problems, such as cutaneous larva migrans.

In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies' income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1 per cent higher social inclusion is associated with a 0.153 per cent to 0.166 per cent more pronounced decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the current crisis.","output":"Testing the differentiated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel demand considering social inclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 12, 2020 WHO announced the status of a global pandemic related to the increasing Covid-19 cases.

Providing effective and timely diagnostics for the multiplicity of infectious diseases is challenging. Conventional diagnostic solutions, although technologically advanced, are highly complex and often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. An alternative strategy involves convenient rapid diagnostics which can be easily administered at the point-of-care (POC) and at low cost without sacrificing reliability. Biosensors and other rapid POC diagnostic tools which require biorecognition elements to precisely identify the causative pathogen are being developed. The effectiveness of these devices is highly dependent on their biorecognition capabilities. Naturally occurring biorecognition elements include antibodies, bacteriophages and enzymes. Recently, modified molecules such as DNAzymes, peptide nucleic acids and molecules which suffer a selective screening like aptamers and peptides are gaining interest for their biorecognition capabilities and other advantages over purely natural ones, such as robustness and lower production costs. Antimicrobials with a broad-spectrum activity against pathogens, such as antibiotics, are also used in dual diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Other successful pathogen identification strategies use chemical ligands, molecularly imprinted polymers and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated nuclease.

Yet, restaurant workers routinely face customer abuse, meager wages, lack of benefits, sexual harassment, and one of the highest rates of turnover across industries. Given these conditions, this qualitative study investigates how restaurant workers make sense of a contested occupation and manage the stigma associated with their occupation. Specifically, this study examines how food and beverage service workers identify with and navigate a demanding industry while managing the sociocultural assumptions of service work. Using a multi-level discourse analytic framework, we analyze how service workers craft and enact occupational identities. Through an analysis of in-depth interviews with 19 restaurant employees, we demonstrate how people foreground the positive attributes of restaurant work while resisting social Discourses that position the work as dirty, demeaning, emotional, and meaningless. We analyze how workers frame the values of working in restaurants and the communicative strategies they use to navigate stigmatized social interactions, including emphasizing flexibility, empathy, emotion management, and teamwork.

Many of the preventive measures implemented during the pandemic can increase sedentary lifestyles, which can lead to the development of chronic diseases, including obesity, among the general population and cause serious threats to peoples physical health and overall quality of life. Individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and may hence have higher levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity levels and mental health status on an individual level and to compare them between those with and those without comorbidities in a cohort of Texas residents, before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was disseminated throughout various regions of Texas. In total, 160 individuals were asked questions about their demographic characteristics, time spent on daily physical activities, and daily mental health status before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 94 (58%) participants reported having 1 medical condition, and 31 (13.1%) had >3 medical conditions. Physical activity levels among participants with 1 pre-existing comorbidity drasticallybut not significantlydecreased, as evident from a 10% increase in sedentary lifestyles after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. On the contrary, we observed a 9% increase in the number of individuals without a pre-existing comorbidity who reported 30-60 min of physical activity per week. There was a 2-fold increase in the number of participants reporting more frequent feelings of nervousness, too much worry, trouble relaxing, and the fear of something awful happening after the pandemic. More specifically, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions reported, on average, a 10% higher incidence of feelings of stress, anxiety, and sadness compared to their healthy counterparts after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life conditions and chronic comorbidities are risk factors that can affect mental health and reduce the ability to perform activities of daily life. Therefore, when implementing pandemic protocols, municipalities should consider providing mental health support to their citizens to protect them from this rather inconspicuous adverse effect.","output":"Decline of Psychological Health Following the Designation of COVID-19 as a Pandemic: Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While increasing hopes are being attached to deliberate societal transformative change to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, questions remain about whether and whereby such profound systemic change can be governed. This paper analyses how transformative changes are intended to be encouraged and achieved, where and when. The paper explores critical drivers and how they relate to leverage points at different places in the societal systems. The paper builds on a comprehensive sense-making analysis of scholarly literature, policy documents, including countries contributions to the Paris Agreement and national reviews of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals, international news media and lay focus group discussions on five continents. There are great variations in how drivers were made sense of in the data. The many ongoing interacting transformations across societies involve different social, cultural, and political contexts, while the implementation of the 2030 Agenda also contains goal conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs. The paper highlights four categories of drivers as particularly important to consider in view of international transformation efforts: technological innovations, political economy redistribution, new narratives, and transformative learning. Four features are important for bringing clarity on how deliberate transformations can be encouraged: (1) the function of drivers in enabling and restricting transformations of societal systems characterised by detailed or dynamic complexity, (2) cultural and geographical contexts of transformations, (3) where in the systems the drivers are intended to intervene, and (4) the role of critical junctions in time, where transformative trajectories can branch out.

The recombinant human A protein (51 aa) was purified to at least 95% purity and characterized in either the lipid-free and lipid-bound states with apoA-I.

With an increasing molar ratio of A, the -helicity of apoA-I was decreased from 62% to 36% with a red shift of the Trp wavelength maximum fluorescence from 337 to 340 nm in apoA-I. The glycation reaction of apoA-I was accelerated further by the addition of A. The treatment of fructose and A caused more multimerization of apoA-I in the lipid-free state and in HDL. The phospholipid-binding ability of apoA-I was impaired severely by the addition of A in a dose-dependent manner. The phagocytosis of LDL into macrophages was accelerated more by the presence of A with the production of more oxidized species. A severely impaired tissue regeneration, and a microinjection of A enhanced embryotoxicity.

Ambulatory cases represent the vast majority of pediatric surgical cases. COVID-19 pandemic-associated regulatory precautions had made the process of seeking medical advice at a suitable appointment such a big problem. We utilized telemedicine (online encounter) to deliver the required healthcare service for sorting and guiding pediatric ambulatory surgical patients. In this article, we aimed to: (1) present our experience, (2) evaluate the effectiveness, and (3) document the results of this technology to solve the problem of difficult healthcare accessibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we compared the utilization of telemedicine (virtual clinic via video consultation) prospectively in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from June 2020 to July 2021 to the in-person clinic encounter at the outpatient department (OPD) retrospectively in the previous year (from June 2019 until the end of May 2020) for perioperative management of pediatric ambulatory surgical patients. The study was conducted at 3 tertiary care pediatric surgery centers. The information recorded for analysis included: demographic data, surgical condition distribution, time interval from the appointment request till the actual encounter with the surgeon, conversation duration, distance traveled, and ultimate fate of the consultations. For both groups, service was evaluated after the first follow-up visit by a patient survey questionnaire (Patient Experience Assessment form) including questions relevant to each encounter. RESULTS: A total of 1124 pediatric patients with various ambulatory surgical conditions had been scheduled for virtual clinic video encounters. Of them, 1056 cases were evaluated by video consultation, supervised by their parents or caregivers, thus, achieving an attendance rate of 94%. Of the remaining cases, 2% (n=23) were canceled and 4% (n=45) did not attend the virtual clinic. Two-thirds of the cases live in rural /remote areas. Patients overall satisfaction was 92%. This was in comparison to 872 pediatric ambulatory surgical patients scheduled for in-person clinic visits before the implementation of the virtual clinic. Of them, only 340 cases had attended the clinic, thus, achieving an attendance rate of 39%. Of the remaining cases, 450 cases (51.6%) were canceled and 82 cases (9.4%) did not attend the clinic (no show). About 48% of the cases live in rural areas. For this group, patients overall satisfaction was 63%. The mean encounter duration was similar for both groups ( 5 minutes). Surgical condition distribution was also similar (p-value: 0.694). For new cases, the time interval from appointment request till the actual encounter was very short for the virtual clinic group (range: 6-15 days) as compared to the in-person clinic group (range: 30-180 days). Patients were followed up for a median period of 143.25 months (range: 6-22 months) with no patient loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can effectively bridge the patient-physician communication gap caused by the regulatory precautions mandated by the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Evidence reviewWe searched the L.OVE platform through July 6, 2021 and included randomized trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard or other active treatments. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analysis, assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach and performed sensitivity analysis excluding trials with risk of bias. ResultsWe included 29 RCTs which enrolled 5592 cases. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low. Compared to standard of care, ivermectin may reduce mortality, may increase symptom resolution or improvement, may increase viral clearance, may reduce infections in exposed individuals and may decrease hospitalizations (Risk difference (RD) 21 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 35 fewer to 4 more). However, after excluding trials classified as \\"high risk\\" or \\"some concerns\\" in the risk of bias assessment, most estimates of effect changed substantially: Compared to standard of care, low certainty evidence suggests that ivermectin may not significantly reduce mortality (RD 7 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 77 fewer to 108 more) nor mechanical ventilation (RD 6 more per 1000, 95%CI: 43 fewer to 86 more), and moderate certainty evidence shows that it probably does not significantly increase symptom resolution or improvement (RD 14 more per 1000, 95%CI: 29 fewer to 71 more) nor viral clearance (RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 84 fewer to 76 more). It is uncertain if ivermectin increases or decreases severe adverse events and symptomatic infections in exposed individuals.

We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting of the terminal restriction fragments (SB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 Covid-19 and 21 non-Covid-19 patients, aged 87  8 (mean  SD) and 87  9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields two key metrics: the proportion of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %), and their mean, TeSLA mTL (expressed in kb).

The UN Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents Health (2016C30) and the Every Newborn Action Plan (led by UNICEF and WHO) call for an end to preventable stillbirths. A first step to prevent stillbirths is obtaining standardised measurement of stillbirth rates across countries. We estimated stillbirth rates and their trends for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019 and assessed progress over time. METHODS: For a systematic assessment, we created a dataset of 2833 country-year datapoints from 171 countries relevant to stillbirth rates, including data from registration and health information systems, household-based surveys, and population-based studies. After data quality assessment and exclusions, we used 1531 datapoints to estimate country-specific stillbirth rates for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019 using a Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regression model, according to a definition of stillbirth of at least 28 weeks gestational age. Our model combined covariates with a temporal smoothing process such that estimates were informed by data for country-periods with high quality data, while being based on covariates for country-periods with little or no data on stillbirth rates. Bias and additional uncertainty associated with observations based on alternative stillbirth definitions and source types, and observations that were subject to non-sampling errors, were included in the model. We compared the estimated stillbirth rates and trends to previously reported mortality estimates in children younger than 5 years. FINDINGS: Globally in 2019, an estimated 20 million babies (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 19C22) were stillborn at 28 weeks or more of gestation, with a global stillbirth rate of 139 stillbirths (90% UI 135C154) per 1000 total births. Stillbirth rates in 2019 varied widely across regions, from 228 stillbirths (198C277) per 1000 total births in west and central Africa to 29 (27C30) in western Europe. After west and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa and south Asia had the second and third highest stillbirth rates in 2019. The global annual rate of reduction in stillbirth rate was estimated at 23% (90% UI 17C27) from 2000 to 2019, which was lower than the 29% (25C32) annual rate of reduction in neonatal mortality rate (for neonates aged <28 days) and the 43% (38C47) annual rate of reduction in mortality rate among children aged 1C59 months during the same period. Based on the lower bound of the 90% UIs, 114 countries had an estimated decrease in stillbirth rate since 2000, with four countries having a decrease of at least 500%, 28 having a decrease of 250C499%, 50 having a decrease of 100C249%, and 32 having a decrease of less than 100%. For the remaining 81 countries, we found no decrease in stillbirth rate since 2000. Of these countries, 34 were in sub-Saharan Africa, 16 were in east Asia and the Pacific, and 15 were in Latin America and the Caribbean. INTERPRETATION: Progress in reducing the rate of stillbirths has been slow compared with decreases in the mortality rate of children younger than 5 years. Accelerated improvements are most needed in the regions and countries with high stillbirth rates, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Future prevention of stillbirths needs increased efforts to raise public awareness, improve data collection, assess progress, and understand public health priorities locally, all of which require investment.

This study aims to investigate the prevalence, and risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses working in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 491 nurses, aged between 31, and 56 years, using a self-administered questionnaire. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), and demographic questions were used to screen the presence of psychological problems, and their associated factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress was 8.5 %, 20.6 and 6.3 %, respectively. Regression analysis showed that anxiety was significantly higher among nurses working in non-COVID wards (p = .01), those who experienced social rejection (p < .05), and those who frequently watched television (p < .05). Those who had temporary contracts were more stressed (p < .05), and those who faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly experienced depression, anxiety, and stress at 10.5 %, 23.5 %, and 8.1 % respectively(p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: While the prevalence of mental distress in this hospital is low, it exists, and hospital management should consider training for all nurses, public sensitization on COVID-19, and provision of financial subsidies for frontline workers, in order to manage the risk factors.","output":"Investigating the burden of mental distress among nurses at a provincial COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the recent study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients has shown a 68% clinical improvement7 it is a one-arm study that renders the evaluation of the efficacy in reducing death and the length of stay of hospitalization intractable due to a lacking of the control group. We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5 days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a further large-scale randomized controlled trial.

Studies carried out in Bangladesh have primarily focused on diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections independently without considering their co-occurrence effect. The present study examines the multimorbid conditions of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children. It explores multimorbidity determinants and the role of community context, which are often overlooked in previous literature. METHODS: Utilizing the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Bangladesh (2017C18), we used mixed-effects random-intercept Poisson regression models to understand the determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children considering the community-level characteristics. RESULTS: The present study found that 28% of the children experienced multimorbidity two weeks prior to the survey. Community-level variability across all the statistical models was statistically significant at the 5% level. On average, the incidence rate of multimorbidity was 1.34 times higher among children from high-risk communities than children from low-risk communities. Moreover, children residing in rural areas and other urban areas involved 1.29 [CI: 1.11, 1.51] and 1.28 [CI: 1.11, 1.47] times greater risk of multimorbidity respectively compared to children from city corporations. Additionally, the multimorbidity incidence was 1.16 times [CI: 1.03, 1.30] higher among children from high-altitude communities than children living in low-altitude communities. CONCLUSION: The significant effect of public handwashing places suggests community-based interventions among individuals to learn hygiene habits among themselves, thus, the severity of coexistence nature of infectious diseases. A higher incidence of coexistence of such infectious diseases in the poor and semi-urban populace further recommends a targeted awareness of a clean environment and primary healthcare programmes.","output":"Determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases among under-five children in Bangladesh: role of community context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives Since March 2020, a rapid increase has been observed in the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has essentially resulted from increased disease transmission and intensified testing and reporting. The international guidelines for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic have been frequently updated. Such guidelines assist the governmental regulatory bodies in taking optimal measures and safeguarding their citizens against the pandemic. We conducted a short survey with a Saudi cohort to understand the awareness about COVID-19 and estimate the responses for mitigation strategies. Methods An electronic survey was conducted, and the first 388 responses were analysed for publishing an initial report. The questionnaire comprised 27 items and was divided into three sections, namely demographic, awareness, and response to mitigation strategies and participants self-perceived behaviours regarding COVID-19. The perceptions of the participants were compared with their responses to mitigation measures. Results In our study, 89.7% understood the meaning of pandemic, while 82.2% correctly identified that the elderly belonged to a high-risk group for the COVID-19 infection. As many as 96.1% agreed that staying at home was one of the mitigation strategies. Nearly 35% preferred self-medication. Higher educational level (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.02- 4.29) and longer working hours were found to be significantly associated with a positive response to mitigation measures with p<0.04 and p<.02, respectively.

In the presented study, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA), based on two monoclonal antibodies against haemagglutinin (HA) of the pH1N1 virus, was developed. After laboratory determination of the sensitivity and specificity characteristics, the performance of this assay was evaluated in a cohort of 904 patients with influenza-like illness. All seven strains of pH1N1 virus tested were positive by pH1N1 ELISA, with an average lower detection limit of 10(3.0  0.4) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50)/mL (or 0.009  0.005 HA titre). Cross-reaction of the assay with seasonal influenza virus and other common respiratory pathogens was rare. In pH1N1-infected patients, the sensitivity of the pH1N1 ELISA was 92.3% (84/91, 95% CI 84.8C96.9%), which is significantly higher than that of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B test (70.3%, p <0.01). The specificity of pH1N1 ELISA in seasonal influenza A patients was 100.0% (171/171, 95% CI 97.9C100.0%), similar to that in non-influenza A patients (640/642, 99.7%, 95% CI 98.9C100.0%). The positive predictive value for pH1N1 ELISA was 97.7% and the negative predictive value was 99.1% in this study population with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine the diagnostic and prognostic role of PCT in patients admitted in an intensive care unit for severe CAP, 110 patients hospitalized in our unit were prospectively studied. Within 48 hours following ICU admission, PCT serum level was measured with a quantitative method above a threshold value of 0.5 ng/ml. RESULTS: Initially focusing on the diagnostic value of PCT, 20% of the patients had a serum PCT level < 0.5 ng/ml, 30% between 0.5 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml, and 50%  2 ng/ml. Serum PCT level was higher in microbiologically documented CAP (median = 4.9 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml if no bacteria were found; p = 0.001), but was not predictive of any specific bacterial agent. Concerning the prognostic value, the serum PCT level was higher for bacteremic patients and/or septic shock patients (4.9 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p = 0.0003). Moreover, PCT levels were increased in patients who developed, during their ICU stay, infectionCrelated complications (septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation). Finally, the initial PCT level was significantly higher in patients who died during the ICU stay (5.6 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). Such a relationship was not found with CCreactive protein (CRP).

This study has analyzed the change in atmospheric pollutants, based on the Sentinel-5Ps and ground-station observed data during partial to complete lockdown period in 2020. Results revealed that the mean tropospheric NO2 concentration substantially dropped in 2020 due to lockdown against the same period in 2019 by 18-40% over the major urban areas located in Europe (i.e. Madrid, Milan, Paris) and the USA (i.e. New York, Boston, and Springfield). Conversely, urban areas with partial to no lockdown measures (i.e. Warsaw, Pierre, Bismarck, and Lincoln) exhibited a relatively lower dropdown in mean NO2 concentration (3 to 7.5%). The role of meteorological variability was found to be negligible. Nevertheless, the reduced levels of atmospheric pollutants were primarily attributed to the shutdown of vehicles, power plants, and industrial emissions.

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70C180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. RESULTS: In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177  45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160  40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. CONCLUSION: Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","output":"Glycaemic Control Among People with Type 1 Diabetes During Lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UCLA Science Libraries improved upon our single service points by creating a team-based, tiered research assistance model to foster student employee skill development.

The optimized protocol was applied to screen a large dataset containing 129,650 molecules, obtained from the ZINC/FDA-Approved database, Mu.Ta.Lig Virtual Chemotheca and Chimiothque Nationale. It was observed that the most promising compounds selected occupy the adenine-binding pocket in PknB, and the main interacting residues are Leu17, Val26, Tyr94 and Met155. Only one of the compounds was able to move the active site residues into an open conformation. It was also observed that the P-loop and magnesium position loops change according to the characteristics of the ligand.

As the pandemic has progressed, the understanding of this disease has evolved. OBJECTIVE: This first in a two-part series on COVID-19 updates provides a focused overview of the presentation and evaluation of COVID-19 for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several variants exist, including a variant of concern known as Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage) and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage). The Delta variant is associated with higher infectivity and poor patient outcomes, and the Omicron variant has resulted in a significant increase in infections. While over 80% of patients experience mild symptoms, a significant proportion can be critically ill, including those who are older and those with comorbidities. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and changes in taste/smell remain the most common presenting symptoms. Extrapulmonary complications are numerous and may be severe, including the cardiovascular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic systems.

The gum rosin coating was deposited over the surface of the face mask outer layer by electrospraying technique. The deposition of GR microspheres was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The thermal analysis determined a cooperative effect between the microspheres and the mask fibre to increase the maximum degradation rate temperature and the onset degradation temperature. To follow the effect of the GR microspheres coating over the hydrophobicity of the surgical face mask, FESEM and wettability analyses were conducted before and after 3, 6, and 9 h of wearing time. In the FESEM image, it was seen that the microsphere was homogeneously distributed over the nonwoven fibre and its presence increases the roughness of the fibres due to the bulge of microspheres. The wettability measurements suggest that the microspheres coating helps to keep the original hydrophobicity of the outer layer of the surgical face mask even after 6 h of wearing time. Indeed, after 9 h of wearing time, the water contact angle (WCA) of the GR coated face mask is higher than the WCA of the surgical face mask without the coating at 3 h of wearing time. Therefore, the gun rosin microspheres coating improved the hydrophobicity of the surgical face mask which may allow improved protection and/or extended lifetime of use. ? 2021 The Author(s)","output":"Deposition of gum rosin microspheres on polypropylene microfibres used in face masks to enhance their hydrophobic behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Staying at home for a prolonged period, the stress during COVID-19 quarantine may affect sleep quality, night eating behaviours of individuals. This paper aims to identify the relationship between night eating behaviour, sleep quality, perceptions of health locus of control in women during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: An anonymous, Web based, cross-sectional study was conducted for the duration of a month (April-May, 2020). The study evaluated the nutritional habits of the participants. Anthropometric measurements were noted. Night Eating Syndrome Questionnaire (NESQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control-A were used for data collection. Findings: With a mean age of 33  8 years, 529 women participated in the study. The mean NESQ score was 14.4  4.7, PSQI score was 6.4  2.9. Higher night eating scores were observed in participants with chance locus of control (CLC) perception when compared to participants with internal health locus of control (IHLC) perception (p < 0.05). Lower sleep quality was observed in obese participants compared to normal/overweight participants (p < 0.05). It was also found that night eating behaviours significantly predicted sleep quality (R = 0.36, R2 = 0.13;p < 0.01), explaining about 13.3% of total variance of sleep quality. Research limitations/implications: Only internet users and women participated in the study, and the questionnaire form was applied online;the information was obtained in the form of the participants' own statements. Practical implications: It was found that night eating behaviour significantly predicted sleep quality during the pandemic. It was also determined that the individuals with high chance locus of control perception had higher NES scores than the individuals with high internal locus of control perception. Originality/value: The night eating behaviours significantly predict sleep quality, individuals with a high perception of CLC had a higher night eating score than individuals with high perception of IHLC during the pandemic. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The dark side of the quarantine: night eating, sleep quality and the health locus of control in women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swine influenza A virus (swIAV) infection causes substantial economic loss and disease burden in humans and animals. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza A virus is now endemic in both populations. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of different vaccines in reducing nasal shedding in pigs following pH1N1 virus challenge. We also assessed transmission from immunized and challenged to naive, directly in-contact pigs. Pigs were immunised with either adjuvanted, whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines or viral vectored (ChAdOx1 and MVA) vaccines expressing either the homologous or heterologous influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein as well as an influenza viral pseudotype (S-FLU) vaccine expressing heterologous HA. Only two vaccines containing homologous HA, which also induced high hemagglutination inhibitory antibody titers, significantly reduced virus shedding in challenged animals. Nevertheless, virus transmission from challenged to naive, in-contact animals occurred in all groups, although was delayed in groups of vaccinated animals with reduced virus shedding.IMPORTANCE This study was designed to determine whether vaccination of pigs with conventional, WIV or viral-vectored vaccines reduces pH1N1 swine influenza virus shedding following challenge and can prevent transmission to naive in-contact animals. Even when viral shedding was significantly reduced following challenge, infection was transmissible to susceptible co-housed recipients. This knowledge is important to inform disease surveillance and control strategies, and to determine the vaccine coverage required in a population, thereby defining disease moderation or herd protection.

Anxiety can make life challenging, leading to withdrawal. Cognitive therapy, using active in vivo learning, enables people to overcome fears. These treatments are not readily available to people with psychosis. Automated virtual reality (VR) therapy is a potential route to increase accessibility. The gameChange automated VR cognitive therapy is designed to help people overcome anxious avoidance and build confidence in everyday social situations. A virtual coach guides the person through the treatment. Understanding user experience is key to facilitating future implementation. Peer research methods, in which people with lived experience of the issues being studied are involved in collecting and analyzing data, may be useful in developing this understanding. This encourages researchers to draw on their lived experience to explore participant perspectives and co-create knowledge. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to use a peer research approach to explore the participant experience of a novel automated VR therapy for anxious social avoidance. This includes understanding (1) the experience of anxious social avoidance in people with psychosis, (2) the experience of the gameChange automated VR cognitive therapy, and (3) any potential impact of the therapy in peoples lives. This will inform future implementation strategies. The secondary objective is to explore how peer research can be used to co-create knowledge. METHODS: Semistructured interviews will be conducted with approximately 25 people with psychosis participating in the gameChange trial (ISRCTN17308399). Participants will be recruited from the five trial centers based in National Health Service mental health trusts across England. Interviews will be conducted by two researchers. One is a peer researcher with similar lived experience to the trial participants. The other has lived experiences of mental health issues that do not directly overlap with those of the trial participants. Interview questions will focus on an individuals experience of anxious social avoidance, experiences of participating in the gameChange VR therapy, and any changes or impact following therapy. The interview schedule was developed in collaboration with the gameChange Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP), comprising 10 project advisors with lived experience of psychosis. Interpretative phenomenological analysis and template analysis will be used to explore individual accounts. The LEAP will contribute to the analysis. RESULTS: Data collection will be conducted from April to September 2021, and analysis will be conducted from June to October 2021. As of September 28, 2021, 20 participants had been interviewed, and coding is underway. CONCLUSIONS: The study, employing a peer research approach, may provide a unique insight into the experiences of anxious social avoidance in people with psychosis and its treatment using automated VR therapy. This will inform potential future implementation of VR automated therapies in mental health services.

METHODS: This study is a quasi-experiment study. The study population was patients who visited all 402 EDs in Korea between December 31, 2019 and May 13, 2020, using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database. The study period was classified into 5 phases according to the level of national crisis warning of infectious disease and the implementation of emergency care-related health policies, and all study phases were 27 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The number of ED visits during the study period was 2,636,341, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The number of ED visits decreased from 803,160 in phase 1 to 496,619 in phase 5 during the study period. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) was 0.77 (0.74-0.79) in phase 5 compared to phase 3. Additionally, by subgroup, the ORs were 0.69 (0.57-0.83) for the patients with acute myocardial infarction and 0.76 (0.67-0.87) for severe trauma in phase 5 compared to phase 3. The ED LOS increased while the number of ED visits decreased as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, and the ED LOS declined after policy implementation (beta coefficient: -5.3 [-6.5 to -4.2] minutes in phase 5 compared to phase 3).

Limited resources and human response to crises can lead members of local communities to turn to one another to fulfil immediate needs. This spontaneous citizen-led response can be crucial to a communitys ability to cope in a crisis. It is thus essential to understand the scope of such initiatives so that support can be provided where it is most needed. Nevertheless, quickly developing situations and varying definitions can make the community response challenging to measure. AIM: To create an accessible interactive map of the citizen-led community response to need during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, UK that combines information gathered from multiple data providers to reflect different interpretations of need and support. APPROACH: We gathered data from a combination of official data providers and community-generated sources to create 14 variables representative of need and support. These variables are derived by a reproducible data pipeline that enables flexible integration of new data. The interactive tool is available online (www.covidresponsemap.wales) and can map available data at two geographic resolutions. Users choose their variables of interest, and interpretation of the map is aided by a linked bee-swarm plot. DISCUSSION: The novel approach we developed enables people at all levels of community response to explore and analyse the distribution of need and support across Wales. While there can be limitations to the accuracy of community-generated data, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used alongside traditional data sources to maximise the understanding of community action. This adds to our overall aim to measure community response and resilience, as well as to make complex population health data accessible to a range of audiences.

Another related challenge arises in dealing with the large number of whatCif scenarios that need to be explored. Here, we describe new computational methods that together provide an approach to dealing with both challenges. A mesoscopic modeling approach is described that strikes a middle ground between macroscopic models based on coupled differential equations and microscopic models built on fine-grained behaviors at the individual entity level. The mesoscopic approach offers the ability to incorporate complex compositions of multiple layers of dynamics even while retaining the potential for aggregate behaviors at varying levels. It also is an excellent match to the accelerator-based architectures of modern computing platforms in which graphical processing units (GPUs) can be exploited for fast simulation via the parallel execution mode of single instruction multiple thread (SIMT). The challenge of simulating a large number of scenarios is addressed via a method of sharing model state and computation across a tree of whatCif scenarios that are localized, incremental changes to a large base simulation. A combination of the mesoscopic modeling approach and the incremental whatCif scenario tree evaluation has been implemented in the software on modern GPUs. Synthetic simulation scenarios are presented to demonstrate the computational characteristics of our approach. Results from the experiments with large population data, including USA, UK, and India, illustrate the modeling methodology and computational performance on thousands of synthetically generated whatCif scenarios. Execution of our implementation scaled to 8192 GPUs of supercomputing platforms demonstrates the ability to rapidly evaluate whatCif scenarios several orders of magnitude faster than the conventional methods.","output":"Mesoscopic Modeling and Rapid Simulation of Incremental Changes in Epidemic Scenarios on GPUs: Fast WhatCIf Analyses of Localized and Dynamic Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and survival rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

We argue that these justifications are insufficient to over-ride the common moral commitment to value each person's life equally. Institutional policies prioritising healthcare workers over other patients also violate other ethical norms of the healthcare professions, including the commitment to put patients first.

During the fusion process, two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, in the S2 domain assemble into a six-helix membrane-fusion structure termed the fusion core. Here, the complete fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E has been determined at 1.86 ? resolution, representing the most complete post-fusion conformation thus far among published human alphacoronavirus (-HCoV) fusion-core structures. The overall structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core is similar to those of SARS, MERS and HCoV-NL63, but the packing of its 3HR1 core differs from those of SARS and MERS in that it contains more noncanonical x and da layers. Side-by-side electrostatic surface comparisons reveal that the electrostatic surface potentials are opposite in -HCoVs and -HCoVs at certain positions and that the HCoV-229E surface also appears to be the most hydrophobic among the various HCoVs.

METHODS: FLAIR (FLAP Inhibition in Renal disease) is an ongoing phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZD5718 in patients with proteinuric CKD with or without type 2 diabetes. Participants receive AZD5718 at 3 different doses or placebo once daily for 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week extension in which they also receive dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) as anticipated future standard of care. The planned sample size is 632 participants, providing 91% power to detect 30% reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) between the maximum dose of AZD5718 and placebo.

These included large event bans, school closures, closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas, and shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. An event-study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 percentage points after 1-5 days, 6.8 after 6-10 days, 8.2 after 11-15 days, and 9.1 after 16-20 days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply 10 times greater spread by April 27 without SIPOs (10 million cases) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the four measures (35 million).

Altoidas Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45C120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoidas DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimers disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimers disease.","output":"Using a Digital Neuro Signature to measure longitudinal individual-level change in Alzheimers disease: the Altoida large cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-COV-2 virus, also known as the coronavirus, has spread around the world While a growing literature suggests that exposure to pollution can cause respi","output":"The Effects of Increased Pollution on COVID-19 Cases and Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that occurred in Hong Kong in 2003 caused serious public health consequences. Its impacts on health-seeking behaviors of the general public have not been assessed. METHODS. Two cross-sectional, random telephone surveys interviewed 1603 Hong Kong adult residents in the post-SARS epidemic period, June and September 2003 to investigate changes in the post-SARS period. RESULTS. Noteworthy percentages of the respondents self-reported increased frequencies of practicing favorable health-seeking behaviors in June 2003, as compared with the pre-SARS period. Few respondents reported the opposite. This was observed in different dimensions: health services seeking, adoption of healthier lifestyle, spending more resources on health, adoption of good personal hygiene, mask use when ill with influenza, and avoidance of risk behaviors. The frequencies of practicing most of these health-seeking behaviors, as measured in June and September 2003, were comparable. Further increases in healthy diet and weight control, etc., were observed during that period. Those who worried about contracting SARS were more likely to have improved health-seeking behaviors.

The international system of coordination established through the World Health Organization via the International Health Regulations largely relies on governments to communicate timely and accurate information about health risk during an outbreak. This information supports WHOs decision making process for declaring a public health emergency of international concern. It also aides the WHO to work with governments to coordinate efforts to contain cross-border outbreaks. Given the importance of information sharing by governments, it is not surprising that governments that withhold or delay sharing information about outbreaks within their borders are often condemned by the international community for non-compliance with the International Health Regulations. The barriers to rapid and transparent information sharing are numerous. While governments must be held accountable for delaying or withholding information, in many cases non-compliance may be a rational response to real and perceived risks rather than a problem of technical incapacity or a lack of political commitment.

Under these circumstances, physicians have limited means to control air leaks when they occur. We discuss a case of severe Covid-19 ARDS complicated by early air-leak which was attributed to idiopathic tracheomegaly, and the associated challenges in the patients' care. CASE PRESENTATION: 60-year-old African American man with polymyositis and diabetes mellitus was intubated with a size 8.0 endotracheal tube (ET) for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to Covid-19 infection. Lung protective ventilation was utilized. He was extubated on day three, but he required re-intubation the following day for worsening mental status and hypoxemia. A significant cuff leak (> 400 ml) on a PEEP of 5 cm H2O was noted. Ppeak and Pplat were 42cm H20 and 39 cm H2O respectively. Arterial blood gas: pH 7.129, PCO2 79.6, PaO2 72. The air leak only resolved when cuff pressures exceeded 70 cm H2O. A chest x-ray confirmed adequate ET tube positioning. Tube exchange with another size 8.0 tube was performed, but the balloon was found to be intact. The ET tube was upsized to size 9.0, yet cuff-pressures as high as 70-80 cm H2O were needed to maintain a leak of < 200ml. Considering focal tracheomalacia, the ET tube was bronchoscopically repositioned at different lengths of the airway, without effect. Extended tracheostomy was technically unfeasible due to the severity of the respiratory failure. A computed tomography (CT) of the neck was pursued for airway injury following re-intubation. Image review suggested tracheomegaly with a tracheal diameter of 29 mm (average 21-25 mm in men);Left and Right mainstem measured 18.11 mm and 21mm respectively. (Figure 1). Size 9.0 ET tube failed to prevent air-leak and lung de-recruitment. In the absence of alternative adult airway products, and with the reassurance obtained from the CT neck, the cuff pressure was deliberately kept at 80 mm Hg to maintain adequate ventilation. DISCUSSION: Risk factors for tracheomalacia include prolonged ventilation, high cuff pressure(>35cm H2O) and airway pressures, steroid use, connective tissue diseases, and systemic shock. Our patient had a history of polymyositis but no other risk factors for early tracheomalacia. This case highlights the challenge of overcoming a life-threatening air leak that was likely exacerbated by elevated airway pressures in a patient with idiopathic tracheomegaly. The cuff leak improved after one week with the recovery of lung compliance. After 45 days in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was discharged to an LTACH with a size 8.0 Shiley tube. CONCLUSIONS: Developing alternative endotracheal airway products should be considered to account for these rare patients. REFERENCE #1: Everson DM.

This study, therefore, aimed to assess households' socioeconomic vulnerability due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was performed among 404 households from different districts in Bangladesh. The socioeconomic vulnerability index (SeVI) was developed using data collected from participants via an online-based self-reported questionnaire that included demographic, social, economic, and physical characteristics as well as exposure to COVID-19. Results: The socioeconomic vulnerability index (SeVI) was calculated as an index score of 0.405 where social, economic, and COVID-19 exposure were reported to be the more impactful components of adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure, respectively. Furthermore, the economic options for households were greatly limited by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications: This study may help to identify the socioeconomic issues that resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak in the country and instruct the policymakers and corresponding authorities on which areas to emphasize for policy implementation so that households become socially and economically less susceptible to the COVID-19 outbreak as well as related infectious diseases and disastrous events in the upcoming years.

Data representing demographics, clinical features, vital signs, laboratory findings, and COVID-19 outcomes were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used for analysis and the results were adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. The patients mean age was 50  17.8 years. Of the 363 patients, 30% were blood group A, 22.3% were blood group B, 8.8% were blood group AB, and 38.8% were blood group O. Bivariate analysis showed that patients with blood group AB were more likely to be free of any medical disease (65.6%) compared to other blood groups (p = 0.007). Fever was the most common presenting complaint (66.7%), and it did not significantly vary with changes in ABO blood groups (p = 0.230). Regarding laboratory characteristics, only C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly associated with the blood groups, with high levels seen in blood groups A, B, and O (p = 0.036). In multivariate analysis, variations in emergency department (ED) disposition, requirement of intensive care unit care, and requirement of mechanical ventilation were not statistically significant among the different ABO blood groups. Furthermore, no correlation was found between hospital death and the different ABO blood groups. In conclusion, COVID-19 is most prevalent among patients with blood group O and least prevalent among those with blood group AB.

Present-day treatments have not shown real improvements in reducing the high mortality rate and the short survival of the disease. The average survival is less than 5% after 5 years. New innovative treatments are necessary to curtail the situation. The very dense pancreatic cancer stroma is a barrier that impedes the access of chemotherapeutic drugs and at the same time establishes a pro-proliferative symbiosis with the tumor, thus targeting the stroma has been suggested by many authors. No ideal drug or drug combination for this targeting has been found as yet. With this goal in mind, here we have explored a different complementary treatment based on abundant previous publications on repurposed drugs. The cell surface protein CD44 is the main receptor for hyaluronan binding. Many malignant tumors show over-expression/over-activity of both. This is particularly significant in pancreatic cancer. The independent inhibition of hyaluronan-producing cells, hyaluronan synthesis, and/or CD44 expression, has been found to decrease the tumor cells proliferation, motility, invasion, and metastatic abilities. Targeting the hyaluronan-CD44 pathway seems to have been bypassed by conventional mainstream oncological practice. There are existing drugs that decrease the activity/expression of hyaluronan and CD44: 4-methylumbelliferone and bromelain respectively. Some drugs inhibit hyaluronan-producing cells such as pirfenidone. The association of these three drugs has never been tested either in the laboratory or in the clinical setting. We present a hypothesis, sustained by hard experimental evidence, suggesting that the simultaneous use of these nontoxic drugs can achieve synergistic or added effects in reducing invasion and metastatic potential, in PDAC. A non-toxic, low-cost scheme for inhibiting this pathway may offer an additional weapon for treating pancreatic cancer.","output":"Targeting the Stromal Pro-Tumoral Hyaluronan-CD44 Pathway in Pancreatic Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated association between epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and clinical outcomes in Korea.

METHODOLOGY: It was a multi-centric study carried at 4 centres across India, providing mental health services. It used convenience sampling method, wherein we recruited a total of 500 subjects from all centres over a period of 6 months using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A semi structured performa to explore the availability, access and utilization of mental health services and difficulties faced by caregivers during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 500 subjects recruited, 54.6 % were males, 80.4% were Hindus and 56% were from rural areas. The subjects reported that 75.3% had problems accessing the mental health services, owing to closure of OPD services (83.2%), non-availability of doctors (63.5%), poor availability of transport (61.9%). It was reported that 16.3% changed their psychiatrist and had to contact GPs (16.5%), their illness worsened in 66.1% of the cases, 68.8% faced difficulties in availing psychotropic medications. The caregivers of these subjects reported that 80.3% of them faced difficulties during lockdown which was attributed to non-availability of doctors (67.5%) and medication (33.6%). DISCUSSION: This sub-sample of registered OPD patients at 4 treatment facilities across India, showed that three fourth of subjects had problems accessing OPD, which was largely due to closure of routine OPDs and non-availability of doctors as well as transport facilities due to pan India lockdown. One sixth of patients had to change their psychiatrist and resort to GPs for consultation. In two third of cases the symptoms worsened and around same numbers did not get psychotropic medications during lockdown. Three fourth of caregivers of patients reported difficulties due to non-availability of doctors and medications. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions affected the availability, access and utilisation of mental health services negatively and lot of difficulties were also faced by caregivers of these patients.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Availability and Utilization Of Mental Health Services: Findings of a Multi-Centric Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Not-for-profit hospitals are facing an uncertain financial future, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they are legally obligated to provide free and discounted health care services to communities. This study investigates the hospital, community, and state regulatory factors and whether these factors are associated with family income eligibility levels for free and discounted care. METHODS: Data were sourced from Internal Revenue Service Form 990, several data files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, demographic and community factors from the Census Bureau, supplemental files from The Hilltop Institute, Community Benefit Insight, and Kaiser Family Foundation. The study employs multilevel mixed-effects linear and ordered logit regressions to estimate the association between the hospital, community, state policies, and the hospital's family income eligibility limit for free and discounted care. RESULTS: A plurality of hospitals (49.96%) offered a medium level of family income eligibility limit (160-200% of the federal poverty level (FPL)) for free care. In comparison, about 53% (52.94%) offered a low level (0-300 of FPL) eligibility limit for discounted care. Holding all else equal, hospitals designated as critical access, safety net, those in rural areas or located in disadvantaged areas were associated with an increased probability of offering low eligibility limits for free and discounted care. Hospitals in a joint venture, located in highly concentrated markets or states with minimum community benefits requirements, were associated with an increased probability of offering high eligibility limits. CONCLUSION: State and community factors appear to be associated with the eligibility level for free and discounted care. Hospitals serving low-income or rural communities seem to offer the least relief. The federal and state policymakers might need to consider relief to these hospitals with a requirement for them to provide a specific set of minimum community benefits.","output":"A multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis of the association between hospital, community and state regulatory factors, and family income eligibility limits for free and discounted care among U.S. not-for-profit, 501(c)(3), hospitals, 2010 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Optometrists have been advised to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined whether face masks were equally protective against transmission of microbes. BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to examine the ability of face masks to reduce transmission of microbes in aerosols and during speech. METHODS: Different face masks, surgical, medical 3-ply and cloth masks with different layers were used. The masks were tested under the ASTM standard F2101-1 to measure their ability to reduce the transmission of aerosolised Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial cells in different sized aerosols were captured on agar plates. The ability of masks to reduce the transmission of bacteria during speech over 30 cm was measured. Bacteria were captured in masks or on agar plates at a distance of 30 cm during the speech. RESULTS: All masks reduced the transmission of aerosolised S. aureus (p  0.007). The medical 3-ply and cloth masks with three layers reduced the transmission of S. aureus aerosols (3.3 m) by 98% and surgical and seven-layer masks reduced this by 100%. An antibacterial silver mask showed significantly greater transmission of S. aureus in aerosols of 4.7 m (16  6 cells) and 3.3 m (122  66 cells) compared to all other masks (0-3 cells and 0-15 cells, respectively; p  0.016). Surgical and three-layer masks had significantly worse filtration of 1.1 m aerosols than for other aerosol sizes. Wearing a mask reduced the transmission of bacteria during speech, but the inner surface of these masks became contaminated with 528-3060 bacterial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Face masks effectively reduce the transmission of microbes in laboratory tests. Face masks made with seven layers were very effective at stopping transmission of S. aureus in all aerosol particle sizes. However, face masks become rapidly contaminated during wear. If masks are to be re-used, they should be regularly replaced or appropriately washed.","output":"The ability of face masks to reduce transmission of microbes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most recently, a technology termed TRIM-Away has allowed acute and rapid destruction of endogenous target proteins in cultured cells using specific antibodies and endogenous/exogenous tripartite motif 21 (TRIM21). However, the relatively large size of the full-size mAbs (150 kDa) results in correspondingly low tissue penetration and inaccessibility of some sterically hindered epitopes, which limits the target protein degradation. In addition, exogenous introduction of TRIM21 may cause side effects for treated cells. To tackle these limitations, we sought to replace full-size mAbs with the smaller format of antibodies, a nanobody (VHH, 15 kDa), and construct a new type of fusion protein named TRIMbody by fusing the nanobody and RBCC motif of TRIM21. Next, we introduced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a model substrate and generated EGFP TRIMbody using a bispecific anti-EGFP (EGFP) nanobody. Remarkably, inducible expression of EGFP TRIMbody could specifically degrade intracellular EGFP in HEK293T cells in a time-dependent manner. By treating cells with inhibitors, we found that intracellular EGFP degradation by EGFP TRIMbody relies on both ubiquitinCproteasome and autophagyClysosome pathways. Taken together, these results suggested that TRIMbody-Away technology could be utilized to specifically degrade intracellular protein and could expand the potential applications of degrader technologies.","output":"A Promising Intracellular Protein-Degradation Strategy: TRIMbody-Away Technique Based on Nanobody Fragment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause numerous diseases, including Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, generating significant health-related and economic consequences.

As a result, authorities around the globe have expressed their needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and to support human labor. Researchers and technology companies such as Google and Apple have offered to develop such tools in the form of contact tracing applications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies and/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in order to force individuals to go into quarantine. In April 2020, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was announced with the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European countries.

There is an urgent need to identify applicable biomarkers for predicting the outcome of COVID-19. Growing evidences have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies remain elevated with disease progression and severity in COIVD-19 patients. We assumed that antibodies may serve as biomarkers for predicting disease outcome. By taking advantage of a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, we surveyed IgM/ IgG responses against 20 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 1,034 hospitalized COVID-19 patients on admission, who were followed till 66 days. The microarray results were correlated with clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes. Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore the association between SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and COVID-19 mortality. We found that high level of IgM against ORF7b at the time of hospitalization is an independent predictor of patient survival (p trend = 0.002), while levels of IgG responses to 6 non-structural proteins and 1 accessory protein, i. e., NSP4, NSP7, NSP9, NSP10, RdRp (NSP12), NSP14, and ORF3b, possess significant predictive power for patient death, even after further adjustments for demographics, comorbidities, and common laboratory markers for disease severity (all with p trend < 0.05). Spline regression analysis indicated that the correlation between ORF7b IgM, NSP9 IgG, and NSP10 IgG and risk of COVID-19 mortality is linear (p = 0.0013, 0.0073 and 0.0003, respectively).

In silico analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in B. anthracis Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD(50) and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement B. anthracis Sterne in the A/J mouse model.

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine correlates of contraceptive dynamics amid COVID-19. RESULTS: Most women did not change their contraceptive status during COVID-19 (68.6% in Burkina Faso and 81.6% in Kenya) and those who did were more likely to adopt a method (25.4% and 13.1%, respectively) than to discontinue (6.0% and 5.3%, respectively).

We constructed seven hidden Markov models for each coronavirus family (SARS-CoV2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), using their complete genome to accurate diagnose human infections. Besides, this study characterized and classified the SARS-CoV2 strains according to their different geographical regions. We built six SARS-CoV2 classifiers for each world's continent (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia). The dataset used was retrieved from the NCBI virus database. The classification accuracy of these models achieves 100% in differentiating any virus model among others in the Coronavirus family. However, the accuracy of the continent models showed a variable range of accuracies, sensitivity, and specificity due to heterogeneous evolutional paths among strains from 27 countries. South America model was the highest accurate model compared to the other geographical models. This finding has vital implications for the management of COVID-19 and the improvement of vaccines.","output":"Geographic classification and identification of SARS-CoV2 from related viral sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of an effective vaccine that protects against COVID-19 is widely considered one of the best paths to ending the current health crisis While the ab","output":"The Role of General Risk Preferences in Messaging About COVID-19 Vaccine Take-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cotton (Gossypium spp.) fiber yield is one of the key target traits, and improved fiber yield has always been thought of as an important objective in the breeding programs and production. Although some studies had been reported for the understanding of genetic bases for cotton yield-related traits, the detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the traits is still very limited. To uncover the whole-genome QTL controlling three yield-related traits in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), phenotypic traits were investigated under four planting environments and 9244 single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage disequilibrium block (SNPLDB) markers were developed in an association panel consisting of 315 accessions. RESULTS A total of 53, 70 and 68 significant SNPLDB loci associated with boll number (BN), boll weight (BW) and lint percentage (LP), were respectively detected through a restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele genome-wide association study (RTM-GWAS) procedure in multiple environments. The haplotype/allele effects of the significant SNPLDB loci were estimated and the QTL-allele matrices were organized for offering the abbreviated genetic composition of the population. Among the significant SNPLDB loci, six of them were simultaneously identified in two or more single planting environments and were thought of as the stable SNPLDB loci. Additionally, a total of 115 genes were annotated in the nearby regions of the six stable SNPLDB loci, and 16 common potential candidate genes controlling target traits of them were predicted by two RNA-seq data. One of 16 genes (GH_D06G2161) was mainly expressed in the early ovule-development stages, and the stable SNPLDB locus (LDB_19_62926589) was mapped in its promoter region. CONCLUSION This study identified the QTL alleles and candidate genes that could provide important insights into the genetic basis of yield-related traits in upland cotton and might facilitate breeding cotton varieties with high yield.","output":"An RTM-GWAS procedure reveals the QTL alleles and candidate genes for three yield-related traits in upland cotton."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) remains a major cattle disease in Africa with serious socio-economic consequences.

In-depth interviews were conducted with fifteen women who were married before age 18, recruited from psychiatry outpatient department and eleven key informants. Thematic analysis was used. Low educated, poor family environment with domestic violence and neglect of children, loss of parents, lack of access to education, and traditional social structure were stated as causes for EM. Families' attitudes about EM were characterized as their daughter's reputation would be tarnished which implied the daughter's premarital relationships would be perceived as immoral by community. All women experienced traditional, aggressive rituals for the first night of marriage, husbands were mostly insensitive, and coercive resulting a traumatic experience. Women were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional violence; most of them were socially isolated after marriage with restrictions imposed by their spouses and spouses' family that limited communication with their loved ones. The women generally felt unprepared for adult sexual life and motherhood. In order to prevent EM, raising parents' awareness about EM, supporting girls' education, and enforcing legitimate regulations were recommended. Early marriages violate human rights, cause negative consequences for health both physically and mentally, and deepen social inequality for women.

The study was conducted among Israeli Arab citizens (N = 697), who participated in an annual personal security index survey. Multinomial logistic regression was used for the multivariate analysis. The main finding suggests that satisfaction with efficiency of the emergency institutions performance was associated with a lower likelihood of being highly worried of COVID-19 spread, as well as with a lower likelihood of having a great fear of being hurt by its spread. Satisfaction with efficiency of societal institutions performance was associated only with lower likelihood of being moderately worried of the COVID-19 spread. The results imply that the institutions have an ability to reduce the stressors in population by means of efficient performance in mitigating the consequences of the pandemic.

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a pro-inflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-B-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-B and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history C in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.","output":"Social history and exposure to pathogen signals modulate social status effects on gene regulation in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns of possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from donors to patients by corneal transplantation have caused a decline in corneal transplantations. Graft culture media are routinely tested for infectious risks, but it is unclear whether this constitutes a viable means to avoid transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via keratoplasty. We found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not present in the medium after seven days of organ culture of corneas from donors (n = 4), who were SARS-CoV-2-positive upon tissue procurement. These medium samples showed no presence of viral RNA. To pursue this question under controlled conditions and further exclude the possibility of productive infection in corneal grafts, we inoculated corneoscleral discs from healthy donors (n = 8) with infectious SARS-CoV-2 and performed PCR testing of the culture medium at various time points. After seven days of culture, we also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within the inoculated corneal tissue. The medium from tissue samples inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 showed no increase in viral RNA, which may indicate lack of viral replication in these corneal grafts. SARS-CoV-2-RNA was, however, detected on or in corneal tissue seven days after inoculation. Our data suggest that corneal grafts may not be permissive for replication of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrates that PCR testing of culture media cannot safely exclude that tissue has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Here we compare patterns of sequence evolution for H7N9 AIV and mammalian H1N1 viruses during replication and transmission in ferrets. We show that three main factors C purifying selection, stochasticity, and very narrow transmission bottlenecks C combine to severely constrain the ability of H7N9 AIV to effectively adapt to mammalian hosts in isolated, acute spillover events. We find rare evidence of natural selection favoring new or mammalian-adapting mutations within ferrets, but no evidence of natural selection acting during transmission. We conclude that human-adapted H7N9 viruses are unlikely to emerge during typical spillover infections. Our findings are instead consistent with a model in which the emergence of a human-transmissible virus would be a rare and unpredictable, though highly consequential, jackpot event. Strategies to limit the total number of spillover infections will limit opportunities for the virus to win this evolutionary lottery.","output":"Avian H7N9 influenza viruses are evolutionarily constrained by stochastic processes during replication and transmission in mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To analyse lifestyle of Italian families during lockdown, evaluating its possible impact on the collaboration of children with the paediatric dentist and associated predictive factors.

The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M).

DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic.

We use long-running panel data from the Netherlands (LISS) and complement the core survey with our own COVID-specific module, conducted in June 2020, surveying job search effort of employed as well as unemployed respondents. We estimate an empirical model of job search over the business cycle over the period 2008-2019 to explore the gap between predicted and actual job search behavior in 2020. We find that job search during the pandemic recession differs strongly from previous downturns. The unemployed search significantly less than what we would normally observe during a recession of this size, while the employed search mildly more. Expectations about the duration of the pandemic seem to play a key role in explaining job search effort for the unemployed in 2020. Furthermore, employed subjects affected by changes in employment status due to COVID-19 are more likely to search for a job. Conversely, beliefs about infection risk do not seem to be related to job search in a systematic way.","output":"Job Search During a Pandemic Recession: Survey Evidence from the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionEarly reports showed that Omicron (BA.1) SARS-CoV-2 could be less severe. However, the magnitude of risk reduction of hospitalization and mortality of Omicron (BA.1) infections compared with Delta (B.1.617.2) is not yet clear. This study compares the risk of severe disease among patients infected with the Omicron (BA.1) variant with patients infected with Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in Portugal. MethodsWe conducted a cohort study in individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st and 29th December 2021. Cases were individuals with a positive PCR test notified to the national surveillance system. SARS-CoV-2 variants were classified first by whole genomic sequencing (WGS) and, if this information was unavailable, by detecting the S gene target failure. We considered a hospitalization for all the patients admitted within the 14 days after the SARS-CoV-2 infection; after that period, they were censored. The comparison of the risk of hospitalization between Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The mean length of stay was compared using linear regression, and the risk of death between Omicron and Delta patients was estimated with a penalized logistic regression. All models were adjusted for sex, age, previous infection, and vaccination status. ResultsWe included 15 978 participants aged 16 or more years old, 9 397 infected by Delta (B.1.617.2) and 6 581 infected with Omicron (BA.1). Within the Delta (B.1.617.2) group, 148 (1.6%) were hospitalized, and 16 (0.2%) were with the Omicron (BA.1). A total of 26 deaths were reported, all in participants with Delta (B.1.617.2) infection. Adjusted HR for hospitalization for the Omicron (BA.1) variant compared with Delta (B.1.617.2) was 0.25 (95%CI 0.15 to 0.43). The length of stay in hospital for Omicron (BA.1) patients was significantly shorter than for Delta (confounding-adjusted difference -4.0 days (95%CI -7.2 to -0.8). The odds of death were 0.14 (95% CI 0.0011 to 1.12), representing a reduction in the risk of death of 86% when infected with Omicron (BA.1) compared with Delta (B.1.617.2).

The ongoing vaccination programs can slow down the spread of the virus; however, from time to time, the newly emerging variants of concern and antivaccination movements carry the possibility for the disease to remain in our daily lives. After the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, there was scholarly debate whether the virus was of natural origin, or it emerged from a laboratory, some even thinking the agent's potential biological weapon properties suggest the latter scenario. Later, the bioweapon theory was dismissed by the majority of experts, but the question remains that despite its natural origin, how potent a biological weapon the SARS-CoV-2 virus can become over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on 12 bioweapon threat assessment criteria already published in 2018, we performed a literature search and review, focusing on relevant potential bioweapon properties of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Instead of utilizing a survey among experts, we tried to qualify and quantify characteristics according to the available data found in peer-reviewed papers. We also identified other key elements not mentioned in the original 12 bioweapon criteria, which can play an important role in assessing future biological weapons. RESULTS: According to the international literature we analyzed, SARS-CoV-2 is a moderately infectious agent (ID50 estimated between 100 and 1,000), with high infection-to-disease ratio (35%-45% rate of asymptomatic infected) and medium incubation period (1-34 days, mean 6-7 days). Its morbidity and mortality rate can be categorized as medium (high morbidity rate with significant mortality rate). It can be easily produced in large quantities, has high aerosol stability, and has moderate environmental stability. Based on laboratory experiments and statistical model analysis, it can form and is contagious with droplet nuclei, and with spray technique utilization, it could be weaponized effectively. Several prophylactic countermeasures are available in the form of vaccines; however, specific therapeutic options are much more limited. In connection with the original assessment criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 only achieved a \\"0\\" score on the ease of detection because of readily available, relatively sensitive, and specific rapid antigen tests. Based on the pandemic experience, we also propose three new assessment categories: one that establishes a mean to measure the necessary quarantine restrictions related to a biological agent, another one that can represent the personal protective equipment required to work safely with a particular agent, and a third one that quantifies the overall disruptive capability, based on previous real-life experiences. These factors could further specify the threat level related to potential biological weapons. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the virus can become a potent bioweapon candidate in the future, achieving a total score of 24 out of 36 on the original 12 criteria. The SARS-CoV-2 has already proven its pandemic generating potential and, despite worldwide efforts, still remains an imminent threat. In order to be prepared for the future possibility of the virus arising as a bioweapon, we must remain cautious and take the necessary countermeasures.","output":"Analysis of the Virus SARS-CoV-2 as a Potential Bioweapon in Light of International Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is considered the first key action to prevent spread of the virus. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as a gold standard point-of-care diagnostic tool. However, several limitations of RT-PCR have been identified, e.g., low sensitivity, cost, long delay in getting results and the need of a professional technician to collect samples. On the other hand, chest X-ray (CXR) is routinely used as a cost-effective diagnostic test for diagnosis and monitoring different respiratory abnormalities and is currently being used as a discriminating tool for COVID-19. However, visual assessment of CXR is not able to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect COVID-19 directly from CXR images with reasonably good accuracy on a data set that was randomly split into two subsets for training and test. Since these methods require a huge number of images for training, data augmentation with geometric transformation was applied to increase the number of images. It is highly likely that the images of the same patients are present in both the training and test sets resulting in higher accuracies in detection of COVID-19. It is, therefore, vital to assess the performance of COVID-19 detection algorithm on an independent data set with different degrees of the disease before being employed for clinical settings. On the other hand, machine learning techniques that depend on handcrafted features extraction and selection approaches can be trained with smaller data set. The features can also be analyzed separately for various lung conditions. Radiomics features are such kind of handcrafted features that represent heterogeneous appearance of the lung on CXR quantitatively and can be used to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Based on this hypothesis, a machine learning based technique is proposed here that is trained on a set of suitable radiomics features (71 features) to detect COVID-19. It is found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble Bagging Model Trees (EBM) trained on these 71 radiomics features can distinguish between COVID-19 and other diseases with an overall sensitivity of 99.6% and 87.8% and specificity of 85% and 97% respectively. Though the performance is comparable for both methods, EBM is more robust across severity levels. Severity, in this case, was scored between 0 to 4 by two experienced radiologists for each lung segment of each CXR image represents the degree of severity of the disease. For the case of 0 severity, sensitivity and specificity of the EBM method are 91.7% and 100% respectively indicating that there are certain radiomics pattern that are not visibly distinguishable. Since the proposed method does not require any manual intervention (e.g., sample collection etc.), it can be integrated with any standard X-ray reporting system to be used as an efficient, cost-effective and rapid early diagnosis device. It can also be deployed in places where quick results of the COVID-19 test are required, e.g., airports, seaports, hospitals, health clinics, etc.","output":"An Integrated Framework with Machine Learning and Radiomics for Accurate and Rapid Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predictive studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited.

Using an in vitro model of murine emperipolesis, we characterized neutrophils entering megakaryocytes using live-cell spinning disk microscopy and electron microscopy. Approximately half of neutrophils exited the megakaryocyte rapidly, typically in 10 minutes or less, displaying ameboid morphology as they passed through the host cell (fast emperipolesis). The remaining neutrophils assumed a sessile morphology, most remaining within the megakaryocyte for at least 60 minutes (slow emperipolesis). These neutrophils typically localized near the megakaryocyte nucleus. By ultrastructural assessment, all internalized neutrophils remained morphologically intact. Most neutrophils resided within emperisomes, but some could be visualized exiting the emperisome into the cell cytoplasm.

This study aimed to analyse the distribution of deaths in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients between pandemic phases and to evaluate the characteristics of COVID-19 patients deceased during the year. METHODS: Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from the recording system of the Department of Prevention of the Local Health Authority of Abruzzo Region, Italy. The course of the epidemic was stratified in 4 phases: the first wave (March-May 2020), the low incidence phase (June-September 2020), the second wave (October 2020-December 2021), and the variants spread phase in our region (January-March 2021). RESULTS: From March 2020 to March 2021 we registered 17,082 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, of these patients 571 (3.35%) had a fatal outcome. The mortality was the highest during the first peak' phase, interesting the 14.20% of the notified cases, and the lowest during the last phase (2.50%). Mortality due to COVID-19 mainly affected men (54.99%) and geriatric patients (median age: 84; IQR: 75-90). Women dying for SARS-CoV-2 infection had a more advanced median age (87; IQR: 79-92) than men (81; IQR: 73-87). The lowest median age was registered in patients deceased during the low incidence phase (75.5; IQR: 71-82). The median time span, in days, from a SARS-CoV-2 positive test to death was significant lower in the phase 1 (days:10; IQR:4-20) then in phase 4 (days:14; IQR:8-22) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that mortality markedly decreased during the COVID-19 epidemic, and this could be likely related to an improved organisation and delivery of care, in addition to a better knowledge of disease treatment. Elderly patients were more likely to progress toward fatal outcome. The healthcare systems should pay special attention to them in order to effectively manage possible future pandemics.

Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure. The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations. In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations. LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan. Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings. Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).

This study examines how such pandemic-related changes in work and life patterns were associated with depressive symptoms. METHODS: An online survey among participants who use a health app called CALO mama was conducted from 30 April to 8 May 2020 in Japan. Participants consisted of 2846 users (1150 men (mean age=50.3) and 1696 women (mean age=43.0)) who were working prior to the government declaration of a state of emergency (7 April 2020). Their daily steps from 1 January to 13 May 2020 recorded by an accelerometer in their mobile devices were linked to their responses. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen. RESULTS: On average, participants took 1143.8 (95% CI ?1557.3 to ?730.2) fewer weekday steps during the declaration period (from 7 April to 13 May). Depressive symptoms were positively associated with female gender (OR=1.58, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.87), decreased weekday steps (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.45) and increased working hours (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.26). Conversely, starting WFH was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased weekday steps during the declaration period were associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms, but WFH may mitigate the risk in the short term. Further studies on the longitudinal effects of WFH on health are needed.","output":"Changes in work and life patterns associated with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study of health app (CALO mama) users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association between various types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related fear and the level of area deprivation in Korea. METHODS: Different types of COVID-19-related fear were examined, namely fear of infection, fear of dying from infection, fear of public criticism, fear of a family member getting infected and fear of economic loss. The level of area deprivation was measured based on the Area Deprivation Index, which was calculated based on population census data. The association between various types of COVID-19-related fear and the level of area deprivation was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This study included 199 859 individuals from the 253 administrative divisions in South Korea. Findings indicated that fear was most common in individuals residing in the most deprived areas, followed by those in the mediocre and least deprived areas (fear of infection: odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01C1.09; fear of dying from infection: OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19C1.28; fear of public criticism: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15C1.24; fear of a family member getting infected: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07C1.18).

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","output":"Parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multi-methods study in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the discovery of HIV as a causative agent of AIDS, the expectation was to rapidly develop a vaccine; but thirty years later, we still do not have a licensed vaccine.

METHODS: All consecutive patients who referred to healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province (located in South Iran with a population of 4.851 million people) from February 19 until June 2, 2020, and had confirmed COVID-19 by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing and seizure were included. RESULTS: During the study period, 6,147 people had confirmed COVID-19 in Fars province, Iran; 110 people died from the illness (case fatality rate 1.79%). During this time period, five people had seizures (seizure rate 0.08%). In four patients, seizure was one of the presenting manifestations, and in one person, it happened during the course of hospital admission. Two patients had status epilepticus. All patients experienced hypoxemia and four of them needed respirator. Two patients had related metabolic derangements and one had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis.

This is a retrospective case series of four patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to St. Lukes University Health Network ICU between 24 March 2020 and 5 April 2020. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.","output":"Bradycardia in Patients With COVID-19: A Calm Before the Storm?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and antipandemic policies have significantly impacted highway transportation. Many studies have been conducted to quantify these impacts. However, quantitative analysis of the impacts on province-wide traffic in developing countries, such as China, is still inadequate. This paper tried to fill this gap by proposing equations to quantify the traffic variations of overall province-wide traffic and to analyze the intercity bus traffic variation and intercity bus usage, applying the K-means cluster method to conduct the analysis of traffic reductions in regions with different levels of economic development, and using the hypothesis testing for traffic recovery analysis. It is found that passenger vehicle traffic and truck traffic dropped by 59.67% and 68.19% during the outbreak, respectively. The intercity bus traffic on highways declined by 59.8% to 98.6%, and the intercity bus usage dropped by 55.6% on average. For traffic reductions in different regions, the higher the GDP per capita was, the more the traffic was affected by the pandemic. In regions with lower GDP per capita, traffic variations were minor. It is also found that the passenger vehicle traffic went through four stages in 99 days: the Decline Stage, Rapid Recovery Stage, Slow Recovery Stage, and Normal Stage, while truck traffic only experienced the Decline Stage, Rapid Recovery Stage, and Normal Stage and took 51 days to recover to the Normal Stage. In the Rapid Recovery Stage, the recovery rates were 15.6% and 12.9% per week for passenger vehicle traffic and truck traffic, respectively, and the recovery rate was only 2.1% for passenger vehicle traffic in the Slow Recovery Stage. Despite the recovery of traffic volumes, neither passenger-kilometers nor tonne-kilometers of freight in 2020 reached the same level as in 2019. These findings help the understanding of the pandemics impacts on highway traffic for researchers and can provide valuable references for decision-makers to develop antipandemic policies.","output":"How Does COVID-19 Affect Traffic on Highway Network: Evidence from Yunnan Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generally speaking, perception includes individuals subjectivity in terms of how they see or assess the characteristics of a phenomenon.

Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas 96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results on various performance metrics.

To date, vaccination is the best strategy against Sars-Cov-2-related illness. About 3 billions of people received at least one of the approved vaccines. The related adverse events were reported during the various experimental phases, but newer and less common side effects are emerging post-marketing. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (VITT) is one of these insidious adverse reactions and it is considered responsible of venous thrombosis, in both the splanchnic and the cerebral circulation. Although its mechanism has been presumably established, resembling that observed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, some venous thromboses seem not to recognize this etiology and their pathogenesis remains unknown. Here we described a case of cerebral venous thrombosis after administration of the Ad26.COV2.S, presenting without thrombocytopenia, paving the way for possible novel causes of this vaccine-induced pathological condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman came to our observation for bilateral periorbital headache associated with retro-orbital pain started 8 days after administration of COVID vaccine Jannsen. Ophthalmologic exam showing a bilateral papilledema raised the suspicion of intracranial hypertension. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed signal alteration with T1-positive contrast enhancement in the right temporal and insular lobes suggestive of cerebral venous thrombosis. The absence of thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) antibodies led the clinicians to rule out VITT. The patient was treated successfully with warfarin. CONCLUSION: Venous thrombosis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination represents an adverse event of special interest. Patients with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia appear to be affected by a general thrombophilic state, sustained by an autoimmune mechanism, and show a higher mortality. Thrombosis without thrombocytopenias pathogenesis has not yet been clarified, but laboratory data and good response to vitamin K antagonists help clinicians in the differential diagnosis with VITT.

METHODS: We screened a set of novel classes of acridinediones molecules to efficiently bind and inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the Mpro. The repurposed FDA-approved antivirals were taken as standard molecules for this study. Long term (1.1 s) MD simulations were performed to analyze the conformational space of the binding pocket of Mpro bound to the selected molecules. RESULTS: The molecules DSPD-2 and DSPD-6 showed more favorable MM-PBSA interaction energies and were seated more deeply inside the binding pocket of Mpro than the topmost antiviral drug (Saquinavir). Moreover, DSPD-5 also exhibited comparable binding energy to Saquinavir. The analysis of per residue contribution energy and SASA studies indicated that the molecules showed efficient binding by targeting the S1 subsite of the Mpro binding pocket. CONCLUSION: The DSPD-2, DSPD-6, and DSPD-5 could be developed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

In mice infected with Babesia microti, the red blood cells were lysed, resulting in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity. To compensate for low blood oxygen levels, stress on the heart was greatly increased. Babesiosis induces a variety of pathologies; meanwhile, heart tissues initiate self-repair responses to babesiosis-induced tissue damage to restore heart function. METHODS: To discover the molecular mechanisms of the damage and self-repair in the heart after B. microti infection in mice, we investigated the changes in protein expression and phosphorylation modification levels in heart tissues at 0, 5, 8, 11, and 19 days post-infection using data-independent acquisition (DIA) quantitative proteomics. RESULTS: The numbers of global proteins we identified were 1934, 1966, 1984, 1989, and 1955 and of phosphopeptides were 5118, 5133, 5130, 5133, and 5140 at 0, 5, 8, 11, and 19 days, respectively, in heart cells after infection with B. microti. The results showed that after B. microti infection the differentially expressed proteins in mice mainly include fibrinogen  (Fg), fibrinogen  (Fg), Serpina1b, Serpina1c, cathepsin Z, cytochrome c oxidases (COXs), RPS11, and RPS20. The proteins with phosphorylation changes mainly include 20-kDa light chain of myosin II (MLC20), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and Akt1. These proteins were mainly involved in coagulation processes, cell apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The coagulation cascade-related proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, and other types of proteins are all involved in the damage and self-repair process in the heart after B. microti infection. These results offer a wealth of new targets for further exploration into the causes of heart disease induced by Babesia infection and are of great significance for novel drug development and new opportunities for targeted therapies.

Although the zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses is well accepted, a great number of mammal species were not yet investigated as their potential to carry these viruses. This work aimed to provide an overview of the current state of scientific knowledge about what are the mammal groups well known to be associated to coronaviruses and other viruses and what are the most neglected groups in these studies. Here we analyze the production of scientific publications about these and other viruses in association with the 29 taxonomic orders of the Mammalia class. Our results highlighted that most of these taxonomic orders have been little studied or completely unexplored in researches with this focus, with only six orders accumulating more than 99% of the articles on coronaviruses in mammals. Ten mammal groups were not found in any scientific publication in association with coronaviruses, with four of them not found even in works mentioning any type of viruses. These results reinforce the importance of identify all the natural and intermediate hosts for viruses to improve monitoring of potential zoonosis and reduce the chances of new disease outbreaks.","output":"What we (do not) know about mammal Coronavirus and general virus?

Recently, many smearing incidents have occurred in India, which provoked diverse forms of abusive speech in online space in various languages based on the geographic location. Therefore it is essential to deal with such malicious content. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we demonstrate a large-scale analysis of multilingual abusive speech in Indic languages. We examine different interlingual transfer mechanisms and observe the performance of various multilingual models for abusive speech detection for eight different Indic languages. We also experiment to show how robust these models are on adversarial attacks. Finally, we conduct an in-depth error analysis by looking into the models' misclassified posts across various settings.

Screening of SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools revealed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein induced an immunodominant response in HLA-B7+ COVID-19-recovered individuals that was also detectable in unexposed donors. A single N-encoded epitope that was highly conserved across circulating coronaviruses drove this immunodominant response. In vitro peptide stimulation and crystal structure analyses revealed T cell-mediated cross-reactivity toward circulating OC43 and HKU-1 betacoronaviruses but not 229E or NL63 alphacoronaviruses because of different peptide conformations. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing indicated that cross-reactivity was driven by private TCR repertoires with a bias for TRBV27 and a long CDR3? loop.

The quality of clinical training and assessment have been jeopardized due to the regulatory restrictions and potential hazards to human lives. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the utility and efficacy of an electronic Objective Structured Clinical Examination (e-OSCE), which attempted to transform the format of a face-to-face OSCE to an e-OSCE. Methods We conducted three end of clerkship e-OSCEs for final year medical students in Surgery, Medicine and Family Medicine using the teleconferencing application of Microsoft Teams (MST). The e-OSCE blueprint included the assessment of all clinical skills except physical examination and procedural skills. Examiners supervised e-OSCE from the college campus, while all students were remotely assessed through the MST channels. During the exam, the students stayed in their specified MST channel and examiners rotated across all students. The utility and efficacy of e-OSCE was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire for students, examiners and e-OSCE team. Results The data analysis showed that 93.4% students and 92.2% examiners agreed with the quality and process of e-OSCE. Similarly, 83.6% students and 98% examiners agreed with the seamless organization of e-OSCE. As many as 45.9% students and 74.5% examiners agreed that e-OSCE was close to real life practice. Approximately one fifth of students and one third of examiners preferred e-OSCE over the face-to-face OSCE. The analysis of qualitative data generated the themes of e-OSCE structure and technology. While majority of participants were satisfied with e-OSCE, students were concerned about examiners training and e-OSCE contents. Examiners and e-OSCE team recognized the paper-less, tech-savy, fast and reliable format of e-OSCE. Conclusion During and beyond COVID- 19 era, e-OSCE is a strong substitute to standard OSCE for assessing clinical competence except for physical examination and procedural skills. The planning and implementation of e-OSCE reflects an ingenuity in the assessment of clinical competencies of medical students.","output":"Assessing The Utility and Efficacy of e-OSCE Among Undergraduate Medical Students During The COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Many comparisons have been made on the effect and impact of COVID-19 on influenza pandemics of history Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the strategies utilized by healthcare providers to improve influenza vaccination rates can similarly be applied to the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine The purpose of this study was to determine the rationale of low influenza vaccination rates in an urban allergy clinic and how to improve patient education and knowledge regarding the importance of influenza vaccination A three-year comparison of interventions is presented as well as its application to future COVID-19 vaccinations METHODS: This study was performed at an outpatient allergy and clinical immunology practice (MSBI) with hospital affiliation in New York City, New York A quality improvement medical committee was formed to optimize influenza vaccination rates to greater than 71% and established standardized protocols regarding patient intake workflows, vaccine counseling, and documentation Patient records from four providers were used for this study to compare pre-and post-intervention rates RESULTS: 984 patients met inclusion criteria, with a normal distribution of ages (18-80), race, and sex Average vaccination rates prior to the intervention were 9 25-13 60% The average vaccination rate after the intervention was 91 34% DISCUSSION: The MSBI quality improvement study identified key areas to address in improving influenza vaccination rates Vaccine hesitancy, public misinformation, and ambivalence surrounding vaccination with egg allergies or during a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection were all topics addressed during the 2018-2019 intervention year Additional attention was also put toward provider education and standardization of documentation Shared decision making and intensive education/outreach efforts are needed by physicians and patients alike to overcome vaccine hesitancy In comparing this to upcoming COVID-19 vaccine challenges, similar barriers will likely also need to be addressed Greater research is needed to understand patient motivations regarding hesitancy specific to the COVID-19 vaccine CONCLUSION: As evidenced in the yearly battle with influenza and now the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to identify and implement multi-level strategies to maximize vaccination rates, especially amid a global pandemic With COVID-19 vaccines reaching emergency approval stages, it is important for healthcare providers to start creating workflows and strategies to address patient inquiries The influenza vaccination quality improvement project presented here can be used as a guideline for future evaluations of COVID-19 vaccination efforts","output":"Influenza Vaccination Quality Improvement as a Model for COVID-19 Prophylaxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a novel strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential underscores the need for quality surveillance and laboratory services to contribute to the timely detection and confirmation of public health threats. To provide a framework for strengthening disease surveillance and response capacities in African countries, the World Health Organization Regional Headquarters for Africa (AFRO) developed Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) aimed at improving national surveillance and laboratory systems. IDSR emphasizes the linkage of information provided by public health laboratories to the selection of relevant, appropriate and effective public health responses to disease outbreaks. METHODS: We reviewed the development of Rwanda's National Reference Laboratory (NRL) to understand essential structures involved in creating a national public health laboratory network. We reviewed documents describing the NRL's organization and record of test results, conducted site visits, and interviewed health staff in the Ministry of Health and in partner agencies. Findings were developed by organizing thematic categories and grouping examples within them. We purposefully sought to identify success factors as well as challenges inherent in developing a national public health laboratory system. RESULTS: Among the identified success factors were: a structured governing framework for public health surveillance; political commitment to promote leadership for stronger laboratory capacities in Rwanda; defined roles and responsibilities for each level; coordinated approaches between technical and funding partners; collaboration with external laboratories; and use of performance results in advocacy with national stakeholders. Major challenges involved general infrastructure, human resources, and budgetary constraints.

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. METHODS: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT(?) (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28C), refrigerated conditions (4C) and at 35C. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log(10) PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6 cells was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions.

Allograft reconstruction of the pelvic ring may, however, offer benefits for soft tissue reconstruction of the pelvic floor and hip stability, but little is known about these reconstructions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) What is the postoperative functional status after allograft reconstruction of Type III pelvic defects? (2) What are the rates of hernia, infection, and hip instability? METHODS In this case series, we reviewed all patients with Type III pelvic resections (with or without anterior acetabular wall resections) who underwent allograft reconstruction between 2005 and 2013 at one center (N = 14). During the period in question, reconstruction was the general approach used in patients undergoing these resections; during that time, three other patients were treated without reconstruction as a result of either surgeon preference or the patient choosing to not have reconstruction after a discussion of the risks and benefits. Of the 14 patients treated with reconstruction, complete followup was available at a minimum of 1 year in 11 (other than those who died before the end of the first year; median, 19 months; range 16-70 months among those surviving), one was lost to followup before a year, and two others had partial telephone or email followup. Patient demographics, disease status, functional status, and complications were recorded. For a portion of the cohort (four patients) later in the series, we used a novel technique for anterior acetabular wall reconstruction using the concave cartilaginous surface of a proximal fibula allograft; the others received either a long bone (humerus or femur) or hemipelvis graft. Seven patients died of disease; two had local recurrence, and five died of metastatic disease. RESULTS All patients remained ambulatory Pain at 12 months after surgery was reported as none in five, mild in two, moderate in two, and severe in one. Operative complications included infection in two, symptomatic hernia in one, hip instability in one, dislocated total hip arthroplasty on the first postoperative day in one, and graft failure in one. CONCLUSIONS Allograft reconstruction after Type III pelvic resections can provide functional reconstruction of the pelvic ring, pelvic floor, and, in certain patients with partial anterior acetabular resections, the resected anterior acetabulum. This has implications in preventing the occurrence of hernia and hip instability in this patient population that is classically not reconstructed, although longer-term outcomes in a larger number of patients would help to better delineate this because infection, hernia, hip instability, and graft nonunion still remain concerns with this approach. The most important unanswered question remains whether, on balance, any benefits that may accrue to these patients as the result of reconstruction are offset by a relatively high likelihood of undergoing secondary or revision surgery.","output":"What are the functional results and complications from allograft reconstruction after partial hemipelvectomy of the pubis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasingly, a critical eye has been placed on the methodological quality of consensus statements.

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of psychological distress in a rural area of Australia while exploring the association between psychological distress and social isolation at the individual and area level. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey of 408 adult volunteers was conducted across rural south-eastern New South Wales from October 2019 to April 2020. The Kessler 10 was used to measure psychological distress, while area-level social fragmentation was assessed using the family (ANSFIfam) and mobility (ANSFImob) components of the Australian Neighbourhood Social Fragmentation Index. The number of different occupations of people known socially was used to assess individual-level social isolation. Spatial analysis was performed to identify any spatial autocorrelation. Results: The prevalence of high psychological distress in the sample was 29%. Using logistic regression models, there was little evidence of a relationship between high psychological distress and ANSFIfam (odds ratio (OR)=0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.93, 1.03), or ANSFImob (OR=1.04, 95%CI=0.99, 1.09). High psychological distress also did not appear to be associated with number of occupations known socially (OR=1.00, 95%CI=0.99, 1.00). There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of psychological distress or social fragmentation at the postal area level. Conclusion: The results suggest that social fragmentation or isolation may not have a significant effect on psychological distress in a rural setting.

Methods: All consecutive patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 25-October 1, 2020 within the Intermountain Healthcare system were included. The cohort was randomly divided into 70% derivation and 30% validation cohorts. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for 14-day hospitalization. The optimal model was then adapted to a simple, probabilistic score and applied to the validation cohort and evaluated for prediction of hospitalization and 28-day mortality. Results: 22,816 patients were included; mean age was 40 years, 50.1% were female and 44% identified as non-white race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. 6.2% required hospitalization and 0.4% died. Criteria in the simple model included: age (0.5 points per decade); high-risk comorbidities (2 points each): diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromised status and obesity (body mass index[]30); non-white race/Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity (2 points), and 1 point each for: male sex, dyspnea, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrythmia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease. In the derivation cohort (n=16,030) area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.84) for hospitalization and 0.91 (0.83-0.94) for 28-day mortality; in the validation cohort (n=6,786) AUROC for hospitalization was 0.8 (CI 0.78-0.82) and for mortality 0.8 (CI 0.69-0.9).

However, the function of m6A regulators in differentiation of RR-PTC remains unclear. In this study, online data, clinical samples, and RR-PTC cell lines (K1 and TPC1) were used to identify the m6A regulators that contributed to the differentiation of RR-PTC. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) was found to be associated with thyroid-specific genes in online data analyses, and metastatic PTCs with high expression of IGF2BP2 were prone to be 131I-nonavid in clinical analyses. Furthermore, targeting IGF2BP2 increased 125I uptake in RR-PTC cell lines and enhanced the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression. Mechanistically, IGF2BP2 bound to the m6A modification site of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) 3'-UTR and enhanced the RUNX2 mRNA stability. Moreover, RUNX2 could bind to the promoter region of NIS to block the differentiation of RR-PTC. Together, these results demonstrated that IGF2BP2 represents a diagnostic marker for RR-PTC, suggesting a novel differentiation therapeutic strategy of targeting IGF2BP2.","output":"Targeting IGF2BP2 Promotes Differentiation of Radioiodine Refractory Papillary Thyroid Cancer via Destabilizing RUNX2 mRNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relato: FSF, diagnstico mieloma mltiplo IgG, indice prognstico internacional (ISS) II, Durie-Salmon III, em julho de 2020, antecendentes de diabetes, hipertens?o arterial sistmica, coronariopatia, marca-passo e dislipidemia.

Little is known about appropriate nutrition therapy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection receiving mechanical ventilation. Data regarding patient demographics and nutrition therapy were collected. Patients that received enteral nutrition within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation were compared with patients starting enteral nutrition later. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for baseline differences in patient groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients were included in final analysis. Patients who received enteral nutrition within 24 hours received a significantly greater daily amount of calories (17.5 vs 15.2 kcal/kg, P = .015) and protein (1.04 vs 0.85 g/kg, P = .003). There was no difference in length of stay (18.5 vs 23.5 days, P = .37). The propensity score analysis included 100 patients. Following propensity scoring, significant differences in daily calorie (17.7 [4.6] vs 15.1 [5.1] kcal/kg/d, P = .009) and protein (1.03 [0.35] vs 0.86 [0.38] g/kg/d, P = .014) provision remained. No differences in length of stay or other outcomes were noted in the propensity score analysis. CONCLUSION: Initiation of enteral nutrition within 24 hours was not associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. No harm was detected either.

Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to identify infected patients and fight the virus. Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the virus are relevant in the acute phase only. Serological assays detect antibodies to the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the recovering and recovered phase. Each testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages. To evaluate the test methods, sensitivity (percent positive agreement - PPA) and specificity (percent negative agreement CPNA) are the most common metrics utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV), the probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true positive or negative patient. In this paper, we illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven by false-positive and false-negative results. We demonstrate the value of reporting PFP (probability of false positive results), PFN (probability of false negative results), and costs to patients and healthcare. These risk metrics can be calculated from the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence, cost, and Reff number (people infected by one positive SARS COV-2).","output":"COVID-19 Testing C Impact of Prevalence, Sensitivity, and Specificity on Patient Risk and Cost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is still increasing. The aim of our article is to estimate which of the conventional ICU mortality risk scores is the most accurate at predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients and to determine how these scores can be used in combination with the 4C Mortality Score. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated in tertiary reference COVID-19 hospitals during the year 2020. The 4C Mortality Score was calculated upon admission to the hospital. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated upon admission to the ICU. Patients were divided into two groups: ICU survivors and ICU non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 249 patients were included in the study, of which 63.1% were male. The average age of all patients was 61.32  13.3 years. The all-cause ICU mortality ratio was 41.4% (n = 103). To determine the accuracy of the ICU mortality risk scores a ROC-AUC analysis was performed. The most accurate scale was the APACHE II, with an AUC value of 0.772 (95% CI 0.714C0.830; p < 0.001). All of the ICU risk scores and 4C Mortality Score were significant mortality predictors in the univariate regression analysis. The multivariate regression analysis was completed to elucidate which of the scores can be used in combination with the independent predictive value. In the final model, the APACHE II and 4C Mortality Score prevailed. For each point increase in the APACHE II, mortality risk increased by 1.155 (OR 1.155, 95% CI 1.085C1.229; p < 0.001), and for each point increase in the 4C Mortality Score, mortality risk increased by 1.191 (OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.086C1.306; p < 0.001), demonstrating the best overall calibration of the model.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","output":"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as markers of disease severity in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Aim of the study was to investigate whether aPL positivity correlated with thrombosis in COVID-19 patients and whether it was transient or persistent. Methods: We enrolled COVID-19 patients who underwent aPL tests: Lupus Anticoagulant (LA);IgM, IgG, IgA anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL);and IgM, IgG anti-2-Glycoprotein-I antibodies (a2GPI). Results: Twenty-eight out of 73 (38.4%) patients resulted positive for at least one aPL assay: 32.8% for IgA aCL, 6.8% for IgM aCL and 4.1% for IgM a2GPI. No patients tested positive for IgG aPL or LA at the first determination. Seven (9.6%) patients developed thrombotic events during hospitalization, with 4 of them resulting positive for aPL. In patients with thrombotic events during hospitalization the risk of death was increased 9-fold (LR+8.9, p=0.003). Patients with double positivity for aCL and a2GPI IgM had a LR+ of 6.3 to have thrombotic events (p=0.012) and a LR+ of 4.9 to have elevated D-dimer levels (p=0.027). In 10 out of 28 positive patients, aPL was detected in a second occasion at least 12-weeks apart and two patients confirmed the positivity.

METHODS: This paper is a cross-sectional study that rides on an existing prevention program interviewed 348 French middle school students (209 girls and 139 boys) in grade 8 (M(age) = 13.45; SDage = 0.54) using an online questionnaire between March 17 and May 11, 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown). The study examined the teenagers' perceived stress, coping strategies they had used, including recent use of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis, during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: Teenagers reported lower perceived stress during lockdown than usually, with a significant decrease for girls. Those who perceived the least social support reported the highest levels of stress. The strategies of planning, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, positive reframing, acceptance, and religion were used more than usual, while active coping and self-blame were used less. Acceptance was the most often used strategy and a source of decreased stress during lockdown. A significant decrease in recent tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use was also observed.

Such manipulation of currently marketed, extended-release (ER) opioid analgesics can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the formulations, resulting in poor treatment outcome or serious adverse events. There is an unmet medical need for oral ER opioid formulations suitable for patients with CPD. OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of this study were to conduct in vitro studies to evaluate alternate means of administration of a new, extended-release (ER), abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone for patients with CPD. Specifically, these studies investigated the in vitro equivalence of drug release rates from Oxycodone DETERx? ER intact capsules (control condition) and administration via alternate modes-opening the capsule and sprinkling the microspheres onto soft foods or administration through enteral tubes. Secondary objectives were to compare alternate modes of administration of Oxycodone DETERx? to a commercially available ER-morphine product. METHODS Soft food study: Oxycodone DETERx? microspheres were sprinkled onto and mixed with several soft foods (ie, applesauce, vanilla pudding, strawberry jam, yogurt, and vanilla ice cream); the effect of drug contact time (0, 30, and 60 minutes) on drug release was studied. Enteral tube study: Oxycodone DETERx? microspheres were administered through varying sizes of nasogastric (10 and 12 Fr.) tubes and a 16 Fr. gastrostomy tube using 5 different delivery vehicles (ie, water, liquid nutritional feeds [Jevity?, Ensure?], and milk [whole milk and 2% milk]). Drug release rate was characterized using a standard in vitro dissolution methodology; dissolution of intact Oxycodone DETERx? capsules served as the control for both the soft food and enteral tube studies. Oxycodone concentration was measured using a standardized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Similarity factor (f2) analysis was used to compare similarity of the dissolution profiles of test and control conditions. RESULTS The mean dissolution profile of Oxycodone DETERx? microspheres sprinkled onto and mixed with each of the soft foods were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Study drug-food contact time did not impact dissolution profiles. The dissolution data obtained from Oxycodone DETERx? microspheres passed through enteral feeding tubes of varying sizes were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Unlike a marketed morphine sulfate ER pellet formulation, Oxycodone DETERx? did not clog any of the studied enteral tubes. CONCLUSION A new ER, abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone can be administered by sprinkling onto soft food without affecting the drug release profile of the formulation. The formulation can also be administered directly via enteral tubes without affecting drug release and without clogging enteral tubes. Oxycodone DETERx? may offer physicians and patients with CPD an alternate treatment option, especially in those patients who have dysphagia or an aversion to swallowing monolithic tablet/capsule formulations and for whom analgesic patches or other opioid formulations are not a viable therapeutic option.","output":"Evaluation of an Extended-Release, Abuse-Deterrent, Microsphere-in-Capsule Analgesic for the Management of Patients with Chronic Pain With Dysphagia (CPD)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US annually produces 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge.

A cohort of LC patients from the same surgeons over the preceding 8 months was used as historic controls. Demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, operative data, pain control in the recovery room, complications, length of hospital stay, and cost were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Of the 285 patients, 177 underwent LC and 108 underwent SILC. The mean age was 49.7 years for the LC patients and 48.2 years for the SILC patients (p = 0.44). Two of the LC patients underwent conversion to open surgery. None of SILC patients were converted to open procedure, although nine had additional ports placed. After multivariate adjustment, SILC was associated with a 15% longer operative time (p = 0.053) and a 66% shorter hospital stay (p = 006) than LC.

We also recovered results of galactomannan tests in serum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. RESULTS: Eight male and two female from 51 to 76 years were recovered. They had reported risk factors to develop IPA (haematological malignancies, immunosuppression, diabetes, obesity, intensive care unit stay, among others). Azole susceptible Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated in nine patients and Aspergillus nidulans was isolated in one patient. Only one case was classified as probable aspergillosis, seven cases as putative aspergillosis, and two cases were not classifiable. Eight patients received antifungal treatment. Seven patients died (70%), two are still inpatient due to nosocomial infections and one was discharged referred to another institution.

Descriptive statistics were analyzed by cross-tabulations and presented as numbers and percentages using IBM-SPSS 25. Results The response rate was 60% out of 600. Majority were males (58%) while 45% of the respondents were anesthetists. Ultrasound was used by 47.4% during LA. The majority considered total body weight for dose calculations. Around 50% of respondents identified bupivacaine as the most cardiotoxic. The majority utilized some form of monitoring and were knowledgeable on identification, prevention and initial management of LAST. Approximately 45% identified Intralipid (ILE) as the definitive treatment of LAST, out of which, 66.8% knew the correct dose and 77.2% and 26.5%, the availability and location of storage, respectively. Conclusion The basic knowledge on LAST was satisfactory among the respondents. A statistically significant difference on knowledge on maximum safe doses of LA, ILE in established LAST, its dosage and the availability was identified between anaesthetic and non-anaesthetic doctors and post graduate trainees and the rest of the doctors.

This study provides an overview of emergency department (ED) visits for patients presenting with substance-related self-harm. METHODS: Cases of self-harm in the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) database were extracted (April 2011 to September 2019; N = 15,682), using various search strategies to identify substance-related self-harm cases for patients 10 years and older. Cases involving alcohol, cannabis, illicit drugs, or medications (or any combinations of these) were included. Additional variables, including age and sex, location and the severity of injury (hospital admission) were examined. Proportionate injury ratios (PIR) were used to compare emergency department outcomes of self-harm and unintentional injuries involving substance use. Time trends were quantified using Joinpoint regression. For cases requiring hospital admission, text fields were analyzed for contextual factors. RESULTS: A total of 9470 substance-related self-harm cases were reported (28.1% of all intentional injury cases), representing 820.0 records per 100,000 eCHIRPP records. While age patterns for both sexes were similar, the number of cases for females was significantly higher among 15-19 year olds. Over half (55%) of cases that identified substance type involved medications, followed by multi-type substance use (19.8%). In the ED, there were proportionally more treatments, observations, and admissions presenting with substance-related self-harm compared to substance-related unintentional injury cases. Among those aged 20+ years, a statistically significant increasing trend of 15.9% per year was observed, while among those aged 10-19 years a significant annual percent change of 16.9% was noted (2011 to 2019). Text field analysis demonstrated suicide attempt or ideation was a reoccurring theme among all age groups. Poor mental health status or conflict with family or an intimate partner were reported stressors, depending on age group. Additional self-harming injuries, such as cutting, were reported among all age groups. CONCLUSION: Our study found that hospital admission for substance-related self-harm was highest for patients aged 15-19 years, especially females, and that they were more likely to use medications. The statistically significant increasing trend of cases found between 2011 and 2019 is notable.

Moreover, increased replication in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells, implicates RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 is less adept at antagonizing these host defense pathways compared to other coronaviruses, the innate immune response is still generally weak.

Every country has made great efforts to struggle against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including massive vaccination, immunological patients surveillance, and the utilization of convalescence plasma for COVID-19 therapy. These efforts are associated with the attempts to increase the titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Abs (nAbs) generated either after infection or vaccination that represent the bodys immune status. As there is no standard therapy for COVID-19 yet, virus eradication will mainly depend on these nAbs contents in the body. Therefore, serological nAbs neutralization assays become a requirement for researchers and clinicians to measure nAbs titers. Different platforms have been developed to evaluate nAbs titers utilizing various epitopes sources, including neutralization assays based on the live virus, pseudovirus, and neutralization assays utilizing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein receptor binding site, receptor-binding domain. As a standard neutralization assay, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) requires isolation and propagation of live pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 virus conducted in a BSL-3 containment. Hence, other surrogate neutralization assays relevant to the PRNT play important alternatives that offer better safety besides facilitating high throughput analyses.

Currently, no specific medicine is available to treat infection with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 175 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to January 31, 2020, and to establish a tool to identify potential critical patients with COVID-19 and help clinical physicians prevent progression of this disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical characteristics of 175 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in COVID-19 progression. We established a nomogram to evaluate the probability of progression of the condition of a patient with COVID-19 to severe within three weeks of disease onset. The nomogram was verified using calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 18 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the laboratory parameters (P<.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out 10 risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were age (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.017-1.054; P<.001), CK level (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.0003-1.0039; P=.02), CD4 count (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P=.002), CD8 % (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004-1.012, P<.001), CD8 count (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.835-0.931; P<.001), and C3 count (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.945-24.691; P=.003).

The calibration curves showed that the model had good prediction ability within three weeks of disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a predictive nomogram of critical patients with COVID-19 based on LASSO and Cox regression analysis.

Efforts to recover donor lungs with reversible injuries using ex vivo perfusion systems are limited to <24 hours of support. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending normothermic extracorporeal lung support to 4 days using cross-circulation with conscious swine. METHODS: A swine behavioral training program and custom enclosure were developed to enable multiday cross-circulation between extracorporeal lungs and recipient swine. Lungs were ventilated and perfused in a normothermic chamber for 4 days. Longitudinal analyses of extracorporeal lungs (ie, functional assessments, multiscale imaging, cytokine quantification, and cellular assays) and recipient swine (eg, vital signs and blood and tissue analyses) were performed. RESULTS: Throughout 4 days of normothermic support, extracorporeal lung function was maintained (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction >400 mm Hg; compliance >20 mL/cm H(2)O), and recipient swine were hemodynamically stable (lactate <3 mmol/L; pH, 7.42  0.05). Radiography revealed well-aerated lower lobes and consolidation in upper lobes of extracorporeal lungs, and bronchoscopy showed healthy airways without edema or secretions. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL) 4, IL-6, and IL-10 levels increased less than 6-fold, whereas interferon gamma, IL-1, IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels decreased from baseline to day 4.

This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model. Results: Over the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased ~7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased ~5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were ~2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants. Conclusion: Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks.

Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within Norbecovirus subgenera, with an Evolutionary rate of 1.301  10?3, HPD (1.064  10?3 C 1.434  10?3) subs/site/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus strains was 1968, and 2010, for the African Marbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission.

However, concerns about data quality have hampered their widespread adoption in research and policy decisions. This article presents results from a data verification study undertaken to gain insights into the quality of HMIS data in Ethiopia. We also provide recommendations for working with HMIS data for research and policy translation. We linked the HMIS to the 2016 Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment, a national census of all health facilities that provided maternal and newborn health services in Ethiopia. We compared the number of visits for deliveries and caesarean sections (C-sections) reported in the HMIS in 2015 (JanuaryCDecember) to those found in source documents (paper-based labour and delivery and operating theatre registers) in 2425 facilities across Ethiopia. We found that two-thirds of facilities had good HMIS reporting for deliveries (defined as reporting within 10% of source documents) and half had very good reporting (within 5% of source documents). Results were similar for reporting on C-section deliveries. We found that good reporting was more common in urban areas (OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.59), public facilities (OR: 2.95, 95% CI 1.38 to 6.29) and in hospitals compared with health centres (OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.61). Facilities in the Somali and Afar regions had the lowest odds of good reporting compared with Addis Ababa and were more likely to over-report deliveries in the HMIS. Further work remains to address remaining discrepancies in the Ethiopian HMIS. Nonetheless, our findings corroborate previous data verification exercises in Ethiopia and support greater use and uptake of HMIS data for research and policy decisions (particularly, greater use of HMIS data elements (eg, absolute number of services provided each month) rather than coverage indicators). Increased use of these data, combined with feedback mechanisms, is necessary to maintain data quality.","output":"Using health management information system data: case study and verification of institutional deliveries in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"True splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) are a rare, but potentially fatal, pathology.

We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both Mpro and PLpro proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the Mpro protease and no viable hits for the PLpro protease. Of the Mpro hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead Mpro inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of Mpro inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsin L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Our results highlight the challenges of targeting Mpro and PLpro proteases and demonstrate the need to carefully assess selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to prevent clinical advancement of compounds that function through inhibition of a redundant viral entry pathway.","output":"Challenges for targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteases as a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID-19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: All patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell (CD19+) and NK cell (CD16+ 56+), were significantly lower in severe group (P0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocyte in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The viral fusion glycoprotein (RSV F) plays an essential role in the infection process, and it is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies, making it an attractive site for vaccine development. With this in view, there is a persistent need to identify selective antiviral drugs against RSV, targeting the major antigenic sites on the F protein. We aimed to conduct a robust in silico high-throughput drug screening of one million compounds to explore potential inhibitors that bind the major antigenic site ? and site II on RSV F protein, which are the main target of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). We utilized the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of both antigenic site ? on pre-F and antigenic II on post-F to screen for potential anti-RSV inhibitors. A library of one million small compounds was docked to explore lead binders in the major antigenic sites by using virtual lab bench CLC Drug Discovery. We also performed Quantitative Structure-Activity and Relationship (QSAR) for the lead best binders known for their antiviral activity. Among one million tested ligands, seven ligands (PubChem ID: 3714418, 24787350, 49828911, 24802036, 79824892, 49726463, and 3139884) were identified as the best binders to neutralizing epitopes site ? and four ligands (PubChem ID: 865999, 17505357, 24802036, and 24285058) to neutralizing epitopes site II, respectively. These binders exhibited significant interactions with neutralizing epitopes on RSV F, with an average of six H bonds, docking energy of ? 15.43 Kcalmol(?1), and minimum interaction energy of ? 7.45 Kcalmol(?1). Using in silico virtual screening, we identified potential RSV inhibitors that bind two major antigenic sites on the RSV F protein.

PEDV spread rapidly between pig farms and caused the death of up to 90% of infected piglets. Current vaccines are only partially effective in providing immunity to suckling due to the rapid dissemination and ongoing evolution of PEDV. METHODS: In this study, the complete genome of a PEDV strain in Vietnam 2018 (IBT/VN/2018 strain) has been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of each fragment was assembled to build a continuous complete sequence using the DNASTAR program. The complete nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences of S, N, and ORF3 genes were aligned and analyzed to detect the mutations. RESULTS: The full-length genome was determined with 28,031 nucleotides in length which consisted of the 5UTR, ORF1ab, S protein, ORF3, E protein, M protein, N protein, and 3UTR region. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the IBT/VN/2018 strain was highly virulent belonged to the G2b subgroup along with the Northern American and Asian S-INDEL strains. Multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acids revealed numerous mutations in the S, N, and ORF3 regions including one substitution (766)P > L(766) in the epitope SS6; two in the S(0)subdomain ((135)DN(136) > (135)SI(136) and N(144)> D(144)); two in subdomain S(HR1) at aa (1009)L > M(1009) and (1089)S > L(1089); one at aa (1279)P > S(1279) in subdomain S(HR2) of the S protein; two at aa (364)N > I(364) and (378)N > S(378) in the N protein; four at aa (25)L > S(25), (70)I > V(70), (107)C > F(107), and (168)D > N(168) in the ORF3 protein. We identified two insertions (at aa (59)NQGV(62) and aa (145)N) and one deletion (at aa (168)DI(169)) in S protein. Remarkable, eight amino acid substitutions ((294)I > M(294), (318)A > S(318), (335)V > I(335), (361)A > T(361), (497)R > T(497), (501)SH(502) > (501)IY(502), (506)I > T(506), (682)V > I(682), and (777)P > L(777)) were found in S(A) subdomain. Besides, N- and O-glycosylation analysis of S, N, and ORF3 protein reveals three known sites (25(G+), 123(N+), and 62(V+)) and three novel sites (144(D+), 1009(M+), and 1279(L+)) in the IBT/VN/2018 strain compared with the vaccine strains. Taken together, the results showed that mutations in the S, N, and ORF3 genes can affect receptor specificity, viral pathogenicity, and the ability to evade the host immune system of the IBT/VN/2018 strain. Our results highlight the importance of molecular characterization of field strains of PEDV for the development of an effective vaccine to control PEDV infections in Vietnam.","output":"Changes in the spike and nucleocapsid protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain in Vietnama molecular potential for the vaccine development?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"L'pidmie de coronavirus-2 du syndrome respiratoire aigu svre (SRAS-CoV-2),  l'origine de la maladie  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), prsente une menace importante et urgente pour la sant mondiale Cette infection virale alarmante, dclare pandmique par l'OMS en fvrier 2020, a entra?n des millions de patients infects et des milliers de morts dans le monde Au Maroc, malgr les efforts fournis par les autorits, le SRAS-CoV-2 continue de se propager et constitue un fardeau de morbidit et de mortalit L'objectif de cette tude est de dcrire les caractristiques cliniques des patients marocains COVID-19 et d'tablir la relation entre des sympt?mes cliniques spcifiques,  savoir l'agueusie et/ou l'anosmie, avec ces caractristiques Nous avons ralis une tude transversale descriptive et non interventionnelle analysant les donnes de 108 patients admis  la clinique VINCI, Casablanca (Maroc) La base de donnes porte sur 39 paramtres comprenant des caractristiques pidmiologiques, des mesures anthropomtriques et des analyses biologiques La moyenne d'age des patients tait de 43,35  15,75 ans avec une sex-ratio de 1 :1 L'indice de masse corporelle moyen des patients tait de 25,54  4,66 kg/m2 La majorit des patients prsentaient au moins une comorbidit et parmi les 75 % des cas symptomatiques, environ 50 % prsentaient au moins trois sympt?mes  savoir : fivre (40,7 %), toux (39,8 %), myalgie (28,7 %) et anosmie et/ou agueusie (20,4 %)  partir des analyses biologiques, nous avons remarqu une lymphopnie et une lvation des taux de protine C ractive et du lactate dshydrognases chez 24,1 %, 36,1 % et 35,2 % des sujets, respectivement Une perturbation des marqueurs de la fonction hpatique a t observe dans 15,7 % des cas Pour les autres paramtres d'hmostase, des taux levs de prothrombine et de plaquettes ont t rapports respectivement chez 14,6 % et 14,8 % des patients Les comparaisons lies  la prsence d'anosmie et/ou d'agueusie n'ont pas montr de diffrence pour les caractristiques dmographiques et anthropomtriques, alors qu'une possibilit de diffrence significative a t rvle pour certains paramtres biologiques, en particulier les taux de lymphocytes, de D-dimre et de troponine Cette tude fournit des rsultats significatifs qui seront utiliss non seulement pour complter les tudes prcdentes menes au Maroc afin de reprendre la situation pidmiologique par rapport  d'autres pays, mais aussi pour amliorer la qualit du diagnostic des patients COVID-19 en identifiant tous les sympt?mes de la maladie et pour une meilleure comprhension de ses rsultats cliniques [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Nutrition Clinique et Metabolisme is the property of Elsevier B V and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"tude des caractristiques cliniques et biologiques des patients marocains COVID-19 avec et sans dysfonctionnement olfactif et/ou gustatif"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O guia foi montado para prover orientaes a populao sobre medidas que ajudam a impedir a propagao da doen?a para outras pessoas da casa e a desafogar os servi?os do Sistema de nico de Sade, que s devem ser procurados em casos mais graves","output":"Covid-19: guia ensina como conviver com familiares infectados"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in recent months offers a powerful preventive measure that may help control SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis, trials sequential analysis (TSA) and meta-regression of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the benefit of convalescent plasma for COVID-19. The primary outcome was 28-30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care (ICU) admission. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, and the Cochrane library on 2nd July 2021. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs were identified recruiting 15,587 patients with 8027 (51.5%) allocated to receive convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma use was not associated with a mortality benefit (24.7% vs. 25.5%; OR 0.94 (0.85 C 1.04); p = 0.23; I(2) = 4%; TSA adjusted CI 0.84 C 1.05), or reduction in need for mechanical ventilation (15.7% vs. 15.4%; OR 1.01 [0.92 C 1.11]; p = 0.82; I(2) = 0%; TSA adjusted CI 0.91 C 1.13), or ICU admission (22.4% vs. 16.7%; OR 0.80 (0.21 C 3.09); p = 0.75; I(2) = 63%; TSA adjusted CI 0.0 C 196.05). Meta-regression did not reveal any association with titre of convalescent plasma, timing of administration, nor risk of death and treatment effect (p>0.05). Risk of bias was high in most studies. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, there was no clear mortality benefit associated with convalescent plasma.

Transfusion treatment, however, may have adverse intestinal effects. We aimed to investigate the short-term effects of RBC transfusions, hypothesizing to find signs of oxidative stress and intestinal injury, possibly related to levels of splanchnic (re-)oxygenation. METHODS: We prospectively included preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks). We measured urinary biomarkers for oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and intestinal cell injury (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, I-FABP) shortly before and after RBC transfusion. Splanchnic oxygen saturation (r(s)SO(2)) and r(s)SO(2) variability were assessed simultaneously. RESULTS: Twenty-nine preterm infants received 58 RBC transfusions at various postnatal ages. Six of them developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after transfusion. Urinary 8-isoprostane and I-FABP increased following RBC transfusion (median 282C606 pg/ml and 4732C6968 pg/ml, p < 0.01), more pronounced in infants who developed NEC. Change in I-FABP correlated with change in 8-isoprostane (rho = 0.623, p < 0.01). Lower r(s)SO(2) variability, but not higher mean r(s)SO(2) was associated with higher 8-isoprostane and I-FABP levels after transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm RBC transfusions are associated with concomitant signs of oxidative stress and intestinal injury, parallel with lower variability in splanchnic oxygenation. This may represent the early pathogenetic process of transfusion-associated NEC. IMPACT: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm infants are associated with a near 2-fold increase in urinary biomarkers for oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and intestinal cell injury (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, I-FABP). Magnitude of change in I-FABP strongly correlated with the magnitude of 8-isoprostane change, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of intestinal injury. Lower splanchnic oxygen saturation variability following RBC transfusion was associated with higher 8-isoprostane and I-FABP levels. Loss of splanchnic variability after RBC transfusion may result from increased oxidative stress and its concomitant intestinal injury, possibly representing the early pathogenetic process of transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis.","output":"The short-term effects of RBC transfusions on intestinal injury in preterm infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evolutionary biology is an essential basic science for medicine, but few doctors and medical researchers are familiar with its most relevant principles. Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most? To address these questions, we review current and potential applications of evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease C and remarkably resilient C precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems.","output":"The great opportunity: Evolutionary applications to medicine and public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data concerning impact of COVID-19 among older adults (OA) living at long-term care (LTC) centers. This study investigated how COVID-19 has affected this population. The prevalence of and risk factors for post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety were investigated. METHODS: A semi-structured interview to determine the effect of COVID-19 was conducted to 200 OA at two government LTC centers. The 17-item Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to evaluate post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Most OA reported moderate or severe impact of COVID-19. The most impacted area was financial due to decreased support from outside the center. Seventy percent of OA reported no or mild psychological stress from COVID-19; however, 5.5% had post-traumatic stress, 7.0% had depression, and 12.0% had anxiety. Higher psychological stress from COVID-19 and having respiratory tract infection symptoms were independently associated with post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Receiving COVID-19 news via social media was independently associated with post-traumatic stress and depression. Having psychiatric comorbidity was independently associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: OA living in LTC centers reported moderate or severe impact from COVID-19, especially financial, but relatively low psychological stress. Psychological stress from COVID-19, having respiratory tract infection symptoms, and receiving COVID-19 news via social media were risk factors for psychological disorders.

RESULTS We identified themes and sub-themes representative of major causes of moral distress in nurses caring Covid-19 patients. These included (a) lack of knowledge and uncertainty regarding how to treat a new illness; (b) being overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the Covid-19 illness; (c) fear of exposure to the virus leading to suboptimal care; (d) adopting a team model of nursing care that caused intra-professional tensions and miscommunications; (e) policies to reduce viral transmission (visitation policy and PPE policy) that prevented nurses to assume their caring role; (f) practicing within crisis standards of care; and (g) dealing with medical resource scarcity. Participants discussed their coping mechanisms and suggested future strategies. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Our study affirms new causes of moral distress related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Institutions need to develop a supportive ethical climate that can restore nurses' moral resiliency. Such a climate should include non-hierarchical interdisciplinary spaces where all providers can meet together as moral peers to discuss their experiences.","output":"Moral distress in nurses caring for patients with Covid-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged &#8805;18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time. RESULTS: 17a282a905 adults were included, of whom 27a480 (016%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14a882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 290 (95% CI 196-430; p<00001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 259 (95% CI 174-384; p<00001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 431 (95% CI 242-765) versus 184 (103-326) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0044). INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves.

In this paper, IgG imprinted polymers (IgGIPs) were fabricated on the surface of nano Au/nano Ni modified Au electrode (IgGIPs/AuNCs/NiNCs/Au) via metal-free visible-light-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (MVL ATRP). The IgGIPs were prepared by IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-IgG) as both a template and a photocatalyst. After the templates were removed, the photocatalysts (FITC) would not remain in the polymer and avoided all the effect of catalysts on the electrode. The fabricated electrodes were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Under the optimized conditions, IgGIPs/AuNCs/NiNCs/Au was prepared and used as an electrochemical biosensor. The biosensor could be successfully applied for the determination of IgG by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurement. The results showed that the proposed biosensor displayed a broader linear range and a lower detection limit for IgG determination when it was compared to those similar IgG sensors. The linear range from 1.0  10(?6) mg L(?1) to 1.0  10(1) mg L(?1) was obtained with a low detection limit (LOD) of 2.0  10(?8) mg L(?1) (S/N = 3).

A 1-year monitoring study was conducted, and influents and effluents were collected from Guangzhou (GZ), Shenzhen (SZ), Tai Po (TP), Shatin (ST), and Stonecutters Island (SI) WWTPs. Solid phase extraction and HPLC-MS/MS were used for the pretreatment and determination. The detection limits for azithromycin (AZI), erythromycin (ERY), and roxithromycin (ROX) ranged from 0.80 to 2.13 ng/L for the influent and effluent water samples. AZI was the most abundant antibiotic found in the influents, with average concentrations ranging from 571 ng/L to 1046 ng/L at all the target WWTPs. The seasonal average AZI concentration was the highest in all five WWTPs with the concentration of 984 ng/L in autumn, 849 ng/L in winter, 741 ng/L in summer, and 533 ng/L in spring. The seasonal AZI removal rates in the WWTPs were similar, with an average removal rate above 63.3% from spring to winter. All the treatments in the five WWTPs showed removal abilities for AZI, ERY, and ROX, regardless of the three phase treatments, namely, the UV disinfection process and conventional or chemically enhanced process within the WWTPs. For ERY and ROX, the average total removal rates were significantly decreased in the spring among all five WWTPs, at 53.1% and 57.8%, respectively. The GZ and SZ WWTPs displayed better removal rates than the TP, ST, and SI WWTPs, because the activity underlying the modified A2/O process in the GZ and SZ WWTPs has important effects on the antibiotic removal because the bacteria could produce compact granules and make the antibiotics settle faster in the wastewater. The additional UV disinfection in the SZ WWTP improved the removal efficiencies of the target antibiotics; it enhanced the biodegradability of residual organic pollutants in the WWTP effluent. Moreover, the corresponding environmental risks have been assessed and are viewed as a necessary component of future research.

Pause will remain effective in New York City in some form until early June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the \\"post-Pause\\" period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular, if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000 tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the \\"pre-Pause\\" social distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be performing 500,000 tests per day.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed between March 07 and November 13, 2020. Volume and percentage (PO) of lung opacifications and mean HU of the whole lung were quantified using prototype software. 13 laboratory values were collected. Negative outcome was defined as death, ICU admittance, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Positive outcome was defined as care in the regular ward or discharge. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of CT parameters and laboratory values. Independent predictors were combined to establish a scoring system for prediction of prognosis. This score was validated on a separate validation cohort. RESULTS: 89 patients were included for model development between March 07 and April 27, 2020 (mean age: 60.3 years). 38 patients experienced a negative outcome. In univariate regression analysis, all quantitative CT parameters as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), relative lymphocyte count (RLC), troponin, and LDH were associated with a negative outcome. In a multivariate regression analysis, PO, CRP, and RLC were independent predictors of a negative outcome. Combination of these three values showed a strong predictive value with a C-index of 0.87. A scoring system was established which categorized patients into 4 groups with a risk of 7a%, 30a%, 67a%, or 100a% for a negative outcome. The validation cohort consisted of 28 patients between May 5 and November 13, 2020. A negative outcome occurred in 6a% of patients with a score of 0, 50a% with a score of 1, and 100a% with a score of 2 or 3. CONCLUSION: The combination of PO, CRP, and RLC showed a high predictive value for a negative outcome. A 4-point scoring system based on these findings allows easy risk stratification in the clinical routine and performed exceptionally in the validation cohort. KEY POINTS:  A high PO is associated with an unfavorable outcome in COVID-19.  PO, CRP, and RLC are independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome, and their combination has strong predictive power.

Gene biomarkers are promising to distinguish specific infections from others with similar presenting symptoms for the prescription of correct therapeutics, preventing pandemics. While routine laboratory methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure gene biomarkers have provided highly sensitive and specific viral detection techniques over the years, they are still hampered by their precision and resource intensity precluding their point-of-care use. Recently, there has been growing interest in employing microfluidic technologies to advance current methods for infectious disease determination via gene biomarker measurements. Here, based on the requirement of infection detection, we will review three microfluidic approaches to compartmentalize gene biomarkers: (1) microwell-based PCR platforms; (2) droplet-based PCR; and (3) point-of-care devices including centrifugal chip, SlipChip, and self-powered integrated microfluidic point-of-care low-cost enabling chip. By capturing target genes in microwells with a small sample volume (l), sensitivity can be enhanced. Additionally, with the advance of significant sample volume minimization (pl) using droplet technology, gene quantification is possible. These improvements in cost, automation, usability, and portability have thereby allowed point-of-care applications to decentralize testing platforms from laboratory-based settings to field use against infections.","output":"Microfluidic compartmentalization to identify gene biomarkers of infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune effector cell (IEC) therapies offer durable and sustained remissions in significant numbers of patients with hematological cancers.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a teaching hospital between 18 March-20 May 2020 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics related to severity and mortality were measured and CURB-65, PSI, A-DROP, CALL, and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated as defined previously in the literature. Progression to severe disease and in-hospital/overall mortality during the follow-up of the patients were determined from electronic records. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. The discrimination capability of pneumonia severity indices was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Sixty-two patients (20.8%) presented with severe COVID-19 while thirty-one (10.4%) developed severe COVID-19 at any time from the admission. In-hospital mortality was 39 (13.1%) while the overall mortality was 44 (14.8%). The mortality in low-risk groups that were identified to manage outside the hospital was 0 in CALL Class A, 1.67% in PSI low risk, and 2.68% in CURB-65 low-risk. However, the AUCs for the mortality prediction in COVID-19 were 0.875, 0.873, 0.859, 0.855, and 0.828 for A-DROP, PSI, CURB-65, COVID-GRAM, and CALL scores respectively. The AUCs for the prediction of progression to severe disease was 0.739, 0.711, 0,697, 0.673, and 0.668 for CURB-65, CALL, PSI, COVID-GRAM, A-DROP respectively. The hazard ratios (HR) for the tested pneumonia severity indices demonstrated that A-DROP and CURB-65 scores had the strongest association with mortality, and PSI, and COVID-GRAM scores predicted mortality independent from age and comorbidity.

Brain function monitoring such as the bispectral index (BIS) facilitates anesthetic titration and has been shown to reduce anesthetic exposure. In a randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of BIS monitoring on POCD in 921 elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided anesthesia or routine care. The BIS group had anesthesia adjusted to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during maintenance of anesthesia. Routine care group had BIS measured but not revealed to attending anesthesiologists. Anesthesia was adjusted according to traditional clinical signs and hemodynamic parameters. A neuropsychology battery of tests was administered before and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Results were compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery during the same period. Delirium was measured using the confusion assessment method criteria. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) BIS values during the maintenance period of anesthesia were significantly lower in the control group, 36 (31 to 49), compared with the BIS-guided group, 53 (48 to 57), P<0.001. BIS-guided anesthesia reduced propofol delivery by 21% and that for volatile anesthetics by 30%. There were fewer patients with delirium in the BIS group compared with routine care (15.6% vs. 24.1%, P=0.01). Although cognitive performance was similar between groups at 1 week after surgery, patients in the BIS group had a lower rate of POCD at 3 months compared with routine care (10.2% vs. 14.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98; P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS BIS-guided anesthesia reduced anesthetic exposure and decreased the risk of POCD at 3 months after surgery.

While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. METHOD: The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. RESULTS: The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifies which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identified vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. CONCLUSION: Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save peoples lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In fact, Italy ranks 24th amongst the 27-EU member countries in digital competitiveness which testifies to the significant delays and gaps in basic digital skills amongst the population. Based on the difficulties encountered in organizing distance learning, we assumed that teachers' perceived stress increased. Given that transversal skills can be associated with this relationship, we hypothesized that among these skills, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between the difficulties in organizing distance learning and perceived stress. Since we targeted teachers from Italy and other European countries, we also hypothesized that this mediator effect would be different for both samples.

However, whether these trends reflect a reduction in ACS incidence or a decrease in emergency room visits is unknown. Using Google Trends, queries for chest pain that have previously been shown to closely correlate with coronary heart disease were compared with searches for myocardial infarction and COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates if search terms (or topics) pertaining to chest pain symptoms correlate with the reported decrease in presentations of ACS. METHODS: Google Trends data for search terms chest pain, myocardial infarction, cough, and fever were obtained from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Related queries were evaluated for a relationship to coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, chest pain searches increased in all countries studied by at least 34% (USA P=.003, Spain P=.007, UK P=.001, Italy P=.002), while searches for myocardial infarction dropped or remained unchanged. Rising searches for chest pain included coronavirus chest pain, home remedies for chest pain, and natural remedies for chest pain. Searches on COVID-19 symptoms (eg, cough, fever) rose initially but returned to baseline while chest painCrelated searches remained elevated throughout May. CONCLUSIONS: Search engine queries for chest pain have risen during the pandemic as have related searches with alternative attribution for chest pain or home care for chest pain, suggesting that recent drops in ACS presentations may be due to patients avoiding the emergency room and potential treatment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Google Trends Insights Into Reduced Acute Coronary Syndrome Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins coordinate genome replication and gene expression.

One copy of nsp13 interacts with the template RNA in an opposing polarity to the RdRp and is envisaged to drive the RdRp backwards on the RNA template (backtracking), prompting questions as to how the RdRp can efficiently synthesize RNA in the presence of nsp13. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the nsp132-RTC, revealing four distinct conformational states of the helicases. The results suggest a mechanism for the nsp132-RTC to turn backtracking on and off, using an allosteric mechanism to switch between RNA synthesis or backtracking in response to stimuli at the RdRp active site.","output":"Ensemble cryo-electron microscopy reveals conformational states of the nsp13 helicase in the SARS-CoV-2 helicase replication-transcription complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Il nexiste que peu de donnes concernant la prsentation, lincidence, la svrit et lvolution du COVID-19 chez les patients en hmodialyse chronique.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical courses of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 and identify associations between inpatient clinical features and post-discharge need for acute care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews were performed to record laboratory values, temperature, and oxygen requirements of 99 adult inpatients with COVID-19. Those variables were used to predict emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days post-discharge. PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS): Age &#8805; 18 years, first hospitalization for COVID-19, admitted between March 1 and May 2, 2020, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, managed by an inpatient medicine service. MAIN MEASURES: Ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, temperature, and oxygen requirement were noted. KEY RESULTS: Of 99 patients, five required ED admission within 30 days, and another five required readmission. Fever within 24 h of discharge, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities were not associated with need for ED visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge after admission for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that neither persistent fever, oxygen requirement, nor laboratory marker derangement was associated with need for acute care in the 30-day period after discharge for severe COVID-19. These findings suggest that physicians need not await the normalization of laboratory markers, resolution of fever, or discontinuation of oxygen prior to discharging a stable or improving patient with COVID-19.","output":"Discharge Clinical Characteristics and Post-Discharge Events in Patients with Severe COVID-19: A Descriptive Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high incidence of thrombotic events, particularly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, has been clearly documented in COVID-19 patients.

Three patients suffered an acute coronary syndrome, two with persistent ST-segment elevation, one of whom was treated invasively, and one with transient ST-segment elevation. Eight patients had a cerebrovascular event. Six suffered an acute ischemic stroke and two a transient ischemic attack, 50% of them had a Rankin score 3 at discharge. Three additional patients had a limb thrombotic event, all of them infrapopliteal, and were managed conservatively. All three cases developed necrosis of the toes, two of them with bilateral involvement. The hospitalization death rate of patients with an arterial event was 28.6%.

Highly fluorescent 5-alkynylfuropyrimidines were synthesized (97-46%) and their antiviral properties investigated in vitro. Regiochemistry of the functionalization was achieved with the aid of 5-endo-dig electrophilic halocyclization of acetyl 5-p-tolyl- or 5-p-pentylphenyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Structure of one of the resulting nucleosides, 6-p-tolyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-one, was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and its conformation was compared to related nucleosides. Diverse alkynyl substituents were introduced at the heterobicyclic base C-5 position via Sonogashira coupling of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ones. The resulting compounds had fluorescence emissions of 452 to 481 nm. High quantum yields of 0.53-0.60 were observed for 9-ethynyl-9-fluorenol and propargyl alcohol/methyl ether-modified furopyrimidines. These modified nucleosides, designed in the form of ribose acetyl esters, represent potential tools for fluorescent tagging, studying nucleoside metabolism, 2-deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity, and antiviral activity. Antiviral assays against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses showed that in human embryonic lung (HEL) cell cultures some of the compounds showed antiviral activity (EC(50) 1.3-13.2 M) against varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

BACKGROUND: Supported employment interventions have been extensively tested in severe mental illness populations. These approaches may be beneficial outside of these populations. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PEDro, OTSeeker, and NIOSHTIC for trials including unemployed people with any condition and including severe mental illness if combined with other co-morbidities or other specific circumstances (e.g., homelessness). We excluded trials where inclusion was based on severe mental illness alone. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias (RoB v2.0) and four reviewers extracted data. We assessed rates of competitive employment as compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation or waiting list/services as usual. FINDINGS: Ten randomised controlled trials (913 participants) were included. Supported employment was more effective than control interventions for improving competitive employment in seven trials: in people with affective disorders [risk ratio (RR) 10.61 (1.49, 75.38)]; mental disorders and justice involvement [RR 4.44 (1.36,14.46)]; veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [RR 2.73 (1.64, 4.54)]; formerly incarcerated veterans [RR 2.17 (1.09, 4.33)]; people receiving methadone treatment [RR 11.5 (1.62, 81.8)]; veterans with spinal cord injury at 12 months [RR 2.46 (1.16, 5.22)] and at 24 months [RR 2.81 (1.98, 7.37)]; and young people not in employment, education, or training [RR 5.90 (1.91C18.19)].

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrhoeal illness among the under-five children in in-patient and out-patient cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during January-April 2018 among 60 under-five children with diarrheal illness reporting to pediatric outpatient department (OPD) and 60 under-five children admitted to pediatric ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital. For determining the out-of-pocket health expenditure, both direct and indirect costs for the management of diarrheal illness were estimated both for out-patient and in-patient cases. The cost of the treatment has been presented as the cost of prehospital visits, during a hospital visit and posthospital visit. Results: Overall, median out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrheal illness for out-patient and in-patient cases were Rs. 1186 (interquartile range [IQR]: Rs. 510) and Rs. 6385 (IQR: Rs. 5889), respectively. The median direct expenditure for OPD cases was Rs. 778.50 (IQR: Rs. 263) and indirect expenditure for OPD cases were Rs. 407.50 (IQR: Rs. 336) The median direct and indirect expenditure for inpatient cases were Rs. 3823 (IQR: Rs. 1942) and Rs. 2237 (IQR: Rs. 4256) respectively. Only 13% of in-patient cases had some kind of medical insurance. Conclusion: A considerable economic burden is faced by the families for treating diarrhea in under-five children.

Another facet of risk taking, social risk, has largely been neglected.

In the current study, we developed and validated a measure of concern for health and social risk for use in individuals of 11 years and over (N = 1399). Concerns for both health and social risk declined with age, challenging the commonly held stereotype that adolescents are less worried about engaging in risk behaviours, compared with adults. The rate of decline was steeper for social versus health risk behaviours, suggesting that adolescence is a period of heightened concern for social risk. We validated our measure against measures of rejection sensitivity, depression and risk-taking behaviour. Greater concern for social risk was associated with increased sensitivity to rejection and greater depressed mood, and this association was stronger for adolescents compared with adults. We conclude that social risks should be incorporated into future models of risk-taking behaviour, especially when they are pitted against health risks.","output":"Amplified Concern for Social Risk in Adolescence: Development and Validation of a New Measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic outbreak remains one of the most influential events in the global economy over the recent years.

Young adults are vulnerable to pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes, but little is known about the impact on adolescents. We examined factors associated with perceived changes in mood and anxiety among male youth in urban and Appalachian Ohio. METHODS: In June 2020, participants in an ongoing male youth cohort study were invited to participate in an online survey that included questions about changes in mood, anxiety, closeness to friends and family, and the major impacts of the pandemic. Weighted log-binomial regression models were used to assess the risk of worsened mood and increased anxiety. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between perceived changes in mood and anxiety and perceived changes in closeness to friends and family and open-ended responses to a question about COVID-19's impact on participants. RESULTS: Perceived worsened mood and increased anxiety during the pandemic were associated with higher household socioeconomic status, older age, feeling less close to friends and family, and reporting that COVID-19 negatively affected mental health. A perceived increase in anxiety was also associated with a history of symptoms of depression or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Specific subgroups of male youth may be at heightened risk of worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target vulnerable adolescents and seek to increase closeness to social contacts.

Here we present the protocol for the implementation science (IS) theme within ASSET that aims to (1) understand what HSS interventions work, for whom and how; and (2) how implementation science methodologies can be adapted to improve the design and evaluation of HSS interventions within resource-poor contexts. Methods Pre-implementation phase: The IS theme, jointly with ASSET work-packages, applies IS determinant frameworks to identify factors that influence the effectiveness of delivering evidence-informed care. Determinants are used to select a set of HSS interventions for further evaluation, where work packages also theorise selective mechanisms to achieve the expected outcomes. Piloting phase and rolling implementation phase: Work-packages pilot the HSS interventions. An iterative process then begins involving evaluation, refection and adaptation. Throughout this phase, IS determinant frameworks are applied to monitor and identify barriers and enablers to implementation in a series of workshops, surveys and interviews. Selective mechanisms of action are also investigated. In a final workshop, ASSET teams come together, to reflect and explore the utility of the selected IS methods and provide suggestions for future use. Structured templates are used to organise and analyse common and heterogeneous patterns across work-packages. Qualitative data are analysed using thematic analysis and quantitative data is analysed using means and proportions. Conclusions We use a novel combination of implementation science methods at a programmatic level to facilitate comparisons of determinants and mechanisms that influence the effectiveness of HSS interventions in achieving implementation outcomes across different contexts.

Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.919 [95% credible interval 0.72 to 1.16] and an estimated increase of 1.14 days [-1.86 to 5.21] in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. Results were similar in comparisons with concurrent controls. COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 [0.28 to 1.89] and an estimated difference of -0.4% [-2.7% to 2.4]. One serious adverse event occurred in the colchicine group and one in usual care. ConclusionsColchicine did not improve time to recovery in people at higher risk of complications with COVID-19 in the community.

As the number of people suffering from the pandemic is rising, it is likely to claim more life and worsen global health and economy. Nepal, one of the developing countries in South Asia has been strongly influenced by the pandemic and struggling to contain it with multiple interventions, however, spatiotemporal dynamics of the epidemic and its linkage with various intervention strategies has not been studied yet. Here, we employed the prospective spatial-temporal analysis with SaTScan assessing dynamics of the COVID-19 cases from 23 January to 31 August 2020 at district level in Nepal. The results revealed that COVID-19 dynamics in the early stage of transmission was slower and confined in certain districts. However, from the third week of April, transmission spread rapidly across districts of Province No. 2 and Sudoorpaschim Province, primarily introduced by Nepalese citizens returning from India. Despite nationwide lockdown, nine statistically significant active and emerging clusters were detected between 23 January and 21 July 2020, whereas ten emerging clusters were observed for extended period to 31 August. The population density and population inflow from India crossing the sealed border had significant effects on the elevated risk of the epidemic. The capital city Kathmandu has become the highest-risk active cluster since August when travel restriction has been suspended. Movement restriction appears to be the most effective non-pharmaceutical intervention against the COVID-19 for resource-scarce countries with limited health care facilities.

This study adapted an existing parent training intervention to improve outcomes for low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children with leukemia and pilot tested that intervention for feasibility. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a focus group of 20 Latino parents of children treated for leukemia. Ten Latino families participated in a pilot study of the adapted parenting intervention, consisting of eight sessions over 6 months. RESULTS: Focus groups revealed that parents unanimously supported a parenting intervention but barriers to participation included time constraints, transportation issues, and anxiety in the hospital environment. The parents also highlighted cultural factors that could contribute to the health disparity, such as lack of knowledge and efficacy in facilitating their child's progress with learning and school. In the pilot study, adherence was 90%, establishing feasibility, and the adapted intervention was considered beneficial. The median parenting efficacy scores improved from preintervention to postintervention (median 3.40 vs. 3.94; p < .011), as did parent-reported school functioning of the child (median 50.00 vs. 60.00; p = .088). CONCLUSIONS: This study addressed a health disparity by culturally adapting a parenting intervention, which was designed to improve school functioning, to meet the needs and preferences of low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking families of children with leukemia in Southern California.

These measures have affected economic activities and have impacted a broad range of businesses, such as international traveling, restaurants, and shopping malls. As COVID-19 vaccination efforts progress, countries are starting to relax international travel constraints and permit passengers from certain destinations to cross the border. Moreover, travelers from those destinations are likely required to provide certificates of vaccination results or negative COVID-19 tests before crossing the borders.

Despite the reduced protection from infection, individuals that received 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine were highly protected from more serious consequences of infection4. Here we examine the memory B cell repertoire in a longitudinal cohort of individuals receiving 3 mRNA vaccine doses5,6. We find that the 3rd dose is accompanied by an increase in, and evolution of, anti-receptor binding domain-specific memory B cells. The increase is due to expansion of memory B cell clones that were present after the 2nd dose as well as the emergence of new clones. The antibodies encoded by these cells showed significantly increased potency and breadth when compared to antibodies obtained after the 2nd dose. Notably, the increase in potency was especially evident among newly developing clones of memory cells that differed from the persisting clones in targeting more conserved regions of the RBD. Overall, more than 50% of the analyzed neutralizing antibodies in the memory compartment after a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose neutralized Omicron. Thus, individuals receiving 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine, have a diverse memory B cell repertoire that can respond rapidly and produce antibodies capable of clearing even diversified variants such as Omicron. These data help explain why a 3rd dose of a vaccine that was not specifically designed to protect against variants is effective against variant-induced serious disease.","output":"Increased Memory B Cell Potency and Breadth After a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Boost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To avoid the spread of COVID-19, China implemented strict prevention and control measures, resulting in dramatic variations in air quality.

Our RF model estimates showed that the highest decrease in deweathered PM(2.5) in Wuhan (?43.6%) and Beijing (?14.0%) was at traffic stations during lockdown period (February 1- March 15, 2020), while it was at industry stations in Urumqi (?54.2%). Deweathered NO(2) decreased significantly in each city (30%C50%), whereas accompanied by a notable increase in O(3).

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

We find that policy intervention (\\"lockdown\\") and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes.

The hyssops and medium employed was IMPROSWAB and IMPROVIRAL NAT Medium, Germany. The sample evaluation was conducted through RT-PCR. The results were compared using Fisher's exact test and ROC curve. The gold standard proposed in this paper was the nasopharyngeal + oropharyngeal swabs specimen. Results: The gold standard method detected 10 true positive cases, of which oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva only detected three positive cases. Significant differences (Fisher's exact test p = 0.003) were detected in the comparison between saliva and the gold standart proposed.

Using correlational and quasi-experimental analyses, results indicated that for people who perceive greater disease risk, the association between group-serving bias and restrictive policy support is weakened. This weakened association occurred because people who felt more vulnerable to these diseases increased support for ingroup-protective actions more strongly than xenophobic thoughts.

CONCLUSION The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted surgical patients, both directly through co-morbid infection and indirectly as shown by increasing mortality in peak months, irrespective of COVID-19 status.Higher CFS scores and ASA grades strongly predict outcomes in surgical patients and are an important risk assessment tool during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic On Emergency Adult Surgical Patients and Surgical Services: An International Multi-Center Cohort Study and Department Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) is one of the promising novel antimicrobial agents that have recently been proposed as the alternative to conventional decontamination methods such as heat and chemical sanitizers. Acidic EOW with pH ranging from 2 to 5 is regarded most applicable in the antimicrobial treatment of vegetables and meats. Neutral and alkaline electrolyzed water have also been explored in few studies for their applications in the food industry. Neutral electrolyzed water is proposed to solve the problems related to the storage and corrosion effect of acidic EOW. Recently, the research focus has been shifted toward the application of slightly acidic EOW as more effective with some supplemental physical and chemical treatment methods such as ultrasound and UV radiations. The different applications of electrolyzed water range from drinking water and wastewater to food, utensil, and hard surfaces. The recent studies also conclude that electrolyzed water is more effective in suspensions as compared with the food surfaces where longer retention times are required. The commercialization of EOW instruments is not adopted frequently in many countries due to the potential corrosion problems associated with acidic electrolyzed water. This review article summarizes the EOW types and possible mechanism of action as well as highlights the most recent research studies in the field of antimicrobial applications and cleaning. Electrolyzed water can replace conventional chemical decontamination methods in the industry and household.

Appropriate diagnosis reaching the sub- and pathotype level is the basis of combatting notifiable AIV infections. Real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a standard diagnostic tool. Here, a total of 24 arrayed RT-qPCRs is introduced for full subtyping of 16 hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase subtypes of AIV. This array, designated Riems Influenza A Typing Array version 2 (RITA-2), represents an updated and economized version of the RITA-1 array previously published by Hoffmann et al. RITA-2 provides improved integration of assays (24 instead of 32 parallel reactions) and reduced assay volume (12.5 L). The technique also adds RT-qPCRs to detect Newcastle Disease (NDV) and Infectious Bronchitis viruses (IBV). In addition, it maximizes inclusivity (all sequences within one subtype) and exclusivity (no intersubtypic cross-reactions) as shown in validation runs using a panel of 428 AIV reference isolates, 15 reference samples each of NDV and IBV, and 122 clinical samples. The open format of RITA-2 is particularly tailored to subtyping influenza A virus of avian hosts and Eurasian geographic origin. Decoupling and re-arranging selected RT-qPCRs to detect specific AIV variants causing epizootic outbreaks with a temporal and/or geographic restriction is possible.","output":"Improved Subtyping of Avian Influenza Viruses Using an RT-qPCR-Based Low Density Array: Riems Influenza a Typing Array, Version 2 (RITA-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic dictates that anti-contagion strategies should become matters of essential routine in everyday life. Fomite transference is one of the routes of transmission that has been considered for this virus. However, the risks associated with contaminated surfaces of food packaging kept in refrigerators have not yet been adequately assessed. In this study, a surrogate virus, Alphacoronavirus 1, was used to investigate the persistence of coronavirus dried on a plastic carrier at 4 C. Techniques of wet wiping, with or without disinfectant saturation, were employed to evaluate their effectiveness in the elimination of the virus. If not wiped, the loss of infectivity of the virus on plastic surfaces was, on average, 0.93 log(10) (i.e. 83%) per day of storage at 4 C. Wiping with water-saturated material reduced the initial virus titre on the plastic carrier by 2.4 log(10) (99.6%); the same results were achieved through wiping with bactericidal wipes containing ethanol. Wipes saturated with a combination of disinfectant agents (didecyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide) decreased the virus titre still more efficiently, by 3.8 log(10) (99.98%) and also significantly prevented further transfer of the virus to a secondary surface through wiping.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the implications of delays in transplantation among Canadian end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients to allow pretransplant vaccination. DESIGN: We used a Markov microsimulation model and ESKD patient perspective to study the effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALY]) of living (LD) or deceased donor () kidney transplantation followed by 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine versus delay in LD (Delay LD) or refusal of  offer (Delay ) to receive 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pretransplant. SETTING: Canadian dialysis and transplant centers. PATIENTS: We simulated a 10 000-waitlisted ESKD patient cohort, which was predictively modeled for a lifetime horizon in monthly cycles. MEASUREMENTS: Inputs on patient and graft survival estimates by patient, LD or  characteristics, were extracted from the Treatment of End-Stage Organ Failure in Canada, Canadian Organ Replacement Register, 2009 to 2018. In addition, a literature review provided inputs on quality of life, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, new variants of concern, mortality risk, and antibody responses to 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. METHODS: We conducted base case, scenario, and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the impact of patient, donor, vaccine, and pandemic characteristics on the preferred strategy. RESULTS: In the average waitlisted Canadian patient, receiving 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine post-transplant provided an effectiveness of 22.32 (95% confidence interval: 22.00-22.7) for LD and 19.34 (19.02-19.67) QALYs for . Delaying transplants for 6 months to allow 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine before LD and  transplant yielded effectiveness of 22.83 (21.51-23.14) and 20.65 (20.33-20.96) QALYs, respectively. Scenario analysis suggested a benefit to short delays in  transplants to receive 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in waitlisted patients 55 years. Two-way sensitivity analysis suggested decreased effectiveness of the strategy prioritizing 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to  transplant the longer the delay and the higher the Kidney Donor Risk Index of the eventual  transplant. When assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (infection rates 10-fold and associated mortality 3-fold vs base case), we found short delays to allow 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration pretransplant to be preferable. LIMITATIONS: Risks associated with nosocomial exposure of LDs were not considered. There was uncertainty regarding input parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, new variants, and COVID-19 severity in ESKD patients. Given rollout of population-level SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we assumed a linear decrease in infection rates over 1 year. Proportions of patients mounting an antibody response to 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were considered in lieu of data on vaccine efficacy in dialysis and following transplantation. Non-age-stratified annual mortality rates were used for waitlisted candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that short delays allowing pretransplant vaccination offered comparable to greater effectiveness than pursuing transplantation without delay, proposing transplant candidates should be prioritized to receive at least 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our scenario and sensitivity analyses suggest that caution must be exercised when declining  offers in patients offered low risk  and who are likely to incur significant delays in access to transplantation. While population-level herd immunity may decrease infection risk in transplant patients, more data are required on vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern in ESKD, and how efficacy may be modified by a third vaccine dose, maintenance immunosuppression and timing of induction and rejection therapies.","output":"Kidney Transplantation in Times of Covid-19: Decision Analysis in the Canadian Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In the wake of SARS-CoV-2s global spread, human activities from health to social life to education have been affected.

Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then, we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.

The pathway comprised of six elements: risk identification and communication; adoption of a high-risk post-anaesthesia care unit discharge checklist; prompt nursing admission to ward; intensification of vital signs monitoring; troponin measurement; and prompt access to medical support if required. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Data describing 1189 patients from two groups, before and after implementation of the pathway, were compared. The usual care group comprised a retrospective cohort of high-risk surgical patients between September 2015 and December 2016. The intervention group prospectively included high-risk surgical patients from February 2019 to March 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was 10.5% (78/746) for the usual care and 6.3% (28/443) for the intervention group. After adjustment, the intervention effect remained significant (RR 0.46 (95%CI 0.30-0.72). The high-risk surgical bundle group received more rapid response team calls (24% vs. 12.6%; RR 0.63 [95%CI 0.49-0.80]) and surgical re-interventions (18.9 vs. 7.5%; RR 0.41 [95%CI 0.30-0.59]).

Diabetes has been recognized as a possible risk factor for COVID\\\\19 complications. OBJECTIVE: ISPAD investigated perceptions, challenges and experience of healthcare professionals (HCP) taking care of children and young people with diabetes world\\\\wide during COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: From 21(st) April to 17(th) May 2020, during COVID\\\\19 pandemic, a web\\\\based survey was sent to ISPAD members and former participants of ISPAD conferences by email. RESULTS: Responders from 215 diabetes centres from 75 countries completed the survey. Majority were from UK (35; 16.3%), USA (20; 9.3%) and India (15; 7%). HCP were mostly pediatric endocrinologists (64%). During COVID\\\\19 pandemic, 16.5% of responders continued face\\\\to\\\\face consultation while most changed to telephone (32%) or video (18%) consultations. 19% reported a shortage of medical supplies. 22% reported a delay in diagnosis of patients with new\\\\onset diabetes, while 15% reported a higher incidence of DKA. 12% reported having one or more patients with COVID\\\\19. Most of the 86 children and adolescents with diabetes and COVID\\\\19 had only mild/moderate symptoms, while 5 required admission to an intensive care unit. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This large global survey during COVID\\\\19 pandemic showed that many HCP adapted to the pandemic by resorting to telemedicine. One fourth of HCP reported delays in diagnosis and an increased rate of DKA.

The survey included four parts, namely, workload, training aspects, trainees health and safety, and womens and maternal health, conducted between April 2020 and September 2020. The submission of the questionnaire was voluntary. RESULTS: A total of 103 trainees from 28 cities responded to the survey. The mean duration of training was 2.5 years, and first- to fifth-year residents were included. In this study, 66 trainees (65.3%) were deployed in COVID-19 units, and the number of working hours was 84 hours per week. Moreover, 67% of the trainees reported insufficient outpatient clinic experience to meet education targets. Almost all trainees (101 of 103) trainees reported that the number of surgeries and/or elective surgeries decreased or were canceled. In addition, 63% and 68% of the trainees reported that their surgical skills were hindered by the reduced number of surgeries and dissatisfaction by not achieving a sufficient number of surgeries, respectively. Overall, 71% (n=73) were worried about their training. Only 45 trainees (43.6%) have raised their concerns to their program coordinators. Trainees in Turkey experienced a decrease in the workload during the first COVID-19 wave by 62% (n=64). In average, trainees worked nearly 30 h less than their usual workweek. Only 5% of the trainees (n=5) worked from home. Trainees claimed to have used sufficient personal protective equipment, and 66% (n=68) could keep their social distance in the hospital.

Concerns are rising regarding the quality of such products, as the safeguard of consumers is a priority worldwide. We analyse here the ethanolic content of seven off-the-shelf hand sanitiser gels (two biocides and five cosmetics) from the Italian market, using gas chromatography. The WHO recommends that products containing ethanol should have 60C95% (v/v) alcohol. Four of the tested hand gels have ethanolic contents within the recommended range, while three products (all cosmetics) contain < 60% (v/v), i.e. 52.1% (w/w), ethanol. The product with the lowest alcoholic content has 37.1% w/w ethanol. Toxic methanol is not found in any of the hand sanitisers. We show, in addition, that products with the highest ethanolic content have generally greater antibacterial activity. In conclusion, all tested products are complying with the EU regulations, as the three substandard products are classified as cosmetics, whose purpose is cleaning and not disinfecting. Nevertheless, if such hand cleaners were inappropriately used as hand disinfectants, they might be ineffective. Thus, consumer safety relays on awareness and ability to distinguish between biocidal and cosmetics hand gels. The obtained results might sensitise the scientific community, health agencies and ultimately consumers towards the risks of using hand sanitisers of substandard alcoholic concentration. If the wrong product is chosen by consumers, public health can be compromised by the inappropriate use of low-dosed cosmetic gels as disinfectants, particularly during the period of the CoViD-19 pandemic.

However, these models do not always work effectively in some social media contexts. When considering the use of Arabic in microblogs like Twitter, it is important to note that a variety of different linguistic domains are involved. This is mainly because social media users employ various dialects in their communications. While training word-level models with such informal text can lead to words being captured that have the same meanings, these models cannot capture all words that can be encountered in the real world due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The inability to identify words is one of the main limitations of this word-level model. In contrast, character-level embeddings can work effectively with this problem through their ability to learn the vectors of character n-grams or parts of words. We take advantage of both character- and word-level models to discover more effective methods to represent Arabic affect words in tweets. We evaluate our embeddings by incorporating them into a supervised learning framework for a range of affect tasks.

Single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-organ stretching experiments revealed that the mechanical stress experienced by the growing oesophagus triggers the emergence of a basal KLF4(Bright) committed population, which balances cell proliferation and marks the transition towards homeostasis in a YAP dependent manner.

Whilst well-established, how these programmes are broadly designed and implemented, and how their functioning links to conceptual views of diversity, is not well described in the literature. METHODS This article explores relevant diversity-related literature, including a specific review of all Gateway programmes. FINDINGS Key facets of diversity-related work in medicine, including the distinction between 'widening participation' and 'widening access' are discussed. These distinctions frame the presentation of Gateway years; their selection process, structure and function are described. The purpose of these years is then discussed, with the lens of different discourses around diversity in medicine, to provide theoretical and practical considerations. Recommendations for how faculty can better explore diversity-related issues are also provided. CONCLUSION Gateway programmes may be effective, to some extent, in widening access to medical education, but require considerable resourcing to operate. Though heterogenous in nature, these programmes share common elements. However, discourses around the goals and purpose of this diversification vary based on individuals and institutions. These varied perspectives, as well as the societal and historical implications of diversity-related work, are important for all clinical educators to understand with depth, and address directly, in order to reduce inequalities both within medical education and society at large.","output":"Understanding gateway to medicine programmes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immigrants in the United States (US) today are facing a dynamic policy landscape.

Of these, 32 studies were selected for inclusion and qualitatively synthesized based upon four themes that appeared throughout our analysis: (1) impact on healthcare utilization, (2) impact on womens and childrens health, (3) impact on mental health services, and (4) impact on public health. The impact of each law, policy, mandate, and directive since 1990 is briefly discussed, as are the limitations and risk of bias of each study. INTERPRETATION: Many punitive immigrant policies have decreased immigrant access to and utilization of basic healthcare services, while instilling fear, confusion, and anxiety in these communities. The federal government should preserve and expand access for undocumented individuals without threat of deportation to improve health outcomes for US citizens and noncitizens.","output":"The adverse health effects of punitive immigrant policies in the United States: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary sequestrations (PS) are rare congenital pulmonary malformations, characterized by non-functioning and dysplastic pulmonary tissue, without a normal connection to the tracheobronchial tree and supplied by the systemic arterial circulation.

This study aimed to describe selected factors and pain in 14C15-year-old adolescents and their parents, to assess how these factors are associated with adolescent pain groups, and to explore whether the relationship between pain intensity and HRQOL in adolescents with persistent pain is mediated by self-esteem and self-efficacy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 508 dyads of adolescents (14C15 years) and parents in a school-based setting. Among these, 148 adolescents had persistent pain. We explored the following variables: HRQOL, pain, self-efficacy, self-esteem, sleep, loneliness, stress and sociodemographic variables. All variables were assessed with well-validated instruments. HRQOL was measured with KIDSCREEN-27. Analyses included Chi-square, ANOVA, MannCWhitney U tests, KruskalCWallis and the PROCESS macro method for mediation analyses. RESULTS: Adolescents with pain reported significantly higher levels of stress, loneliness and lack of sleep and lower levels of self-efficacy, self-esteem and HRQOL compared to adolescents without pain. More girls than boys reported pain. Adolescents with persistent pain scored significantly worse on self-esteem, stress, loneliness, lack of sleep, school absence, pain and HRQOL compared to adolescents with shorter pain duration. Adolescent pain groups did not differ significantly considering parental factors. However, more adolescents with persistent pain reported that someone in their family had pain. The associations between pain intensity and the HRQOL subscales in adolescents with persistent pain were completely mediated by self-esteem, but not by self-efficacy. The highest degree of mediation was estimated for the HRQOL subscale school environment (indirect effect = 73.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the complexity within adolescent pain, demonstrating that adolescents with pain differ from adolescents without pain when it comes to gender, school absence, factors within-person and between-persons. Longer pain duration makes adolescents more vulnerable. We confirm the importance of resilience factors for HRQOL but indicate that self-esteem is more important than self-efficacy. To promote HRQOL in adolescents with persistent pain, a strengthening of both their self-esteem and self-efficacy is recommended. We highlight the need for an individual, holistic approach to adolescent pain.

It is based on two phenomena: the constitution of the repertoire of naive T lymphocytes and the evolution of the pathogen and its impact on the immune memory of T lymphocytes. Concerning the latter, pathogen evolution will have a different impact on reinfection depending on the MHC allomorph. If a mutation occurs in a given region, in the case of MHC allotypes, which do not recognize the peptide in this region, the mutation will have no impact on the memory repertoire. In the case where the MHC allomorph binds to the ancestral peptides and not to the mutated peptide, that individual will have a higher chance of being reinfected. This difference in fitness will lead to a variation of the allele frequency in the next generation. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic already support a significant part of this hypothesis and following up on these data may enable it to be confirmed. This hypothesis could explain why some individuals after vaccination respond less well than others to variants and leads to predict the probability of reinfection after a first infection depending upon the variant and the HLA allomorph.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Escape of Pathogenic Variants and MHC Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection that presents a significant annual burden to Canadians and the Canadian healthcare system. Social distancing measures that were implemented to control the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus outbreak were investigated for their ability to lessen the incident cases of seasonal influenza. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using data from Canada's national influenza surveillance system to investigate whether social distancing measures to control COVID-19 reduced the incident cases of seasonal influenza. Data taken from three separate time frames facilitated analysis of the 2019-2020 influenza season prior to, during, and following the implementation of COVID-19-related measures and enabled comparisons with the same time periods during three preceding flu seasons. The incidence, which referred to the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of specific influenza strains, was of primary focus. Further analysis determined the number of new laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness outbreaks. RESULTS: Our results indicate a premature end to the 2019-2020 influenza season, with significantly fewer cases and outbreaks being recorded following the enactment of many COVID-19 social distancing policies. The incidence of influenza strains A (H3N2), A (unsubtyped), and B were all significantly lower at the tail end of the 2019-2020 influenza season as compared with preceding seasons (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0019).

It has been recently shown that the sensitivity of homonuclear correlations involving RNAs labile imino protons can be significantly enhanced, by exploiting the repolarization brought about by solvent exchanges. Homonuclear correlations, however, are of limited spectral resolution, and usually incapable of tackling relatively large homopolymers with repeating structures like RNAs. This study presents a heteronuclear-resolved version of those NOESY experiments, in which magnetization transfers between the aqueous solvent and the nucleic acid protons are controlled by selecting specific chemical shift combinations of a coupled (1)HC(15)N spin pair. This selective control effectively leads to a pseudo-3D version of HSQC-NOESY, but with cross-peaks enhanced by 2C5 as compared with conventional 2D NOESY counterparts.

The patients were divided into two groups: use of BIMA or use of SIMA and propensity matched. To assess the effect of preoperative HbA1c, both groups were further divided into 5 sub-groups: patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), or patients with diabetes mellitus and a preoperative HbA1c level in one of four groups (< 7%, 7-9%, 9-11%, or > 11%).

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the thermal injury of nerve root by cauterization near the nerve root and to identify the prevention or rescue procedure of nerve root injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA In spine surgery, bipolar cauterization of epidural venous plexus near the nerve root is an essential procedure to control bleeding. Although a potential risk of neurological thermal damage exists, the underlying mechanism and prevention have not been elucidated. METHODS Temperature measurement and histological evaluation after bipolar cauterization near the posterior branch of the nerve root were performed using a rabbit model. Subsequently, the effect of saline irrigation or changing the direction of bipolar forceps to reduce thermal elevation during bipolar cauterization was evaluated. Finally, the effectiveness of locally injected corticosteroid after bipolar cauterization was evaluated. RESULTS After bipolar cauterization, temperature of the surrounding site reached 60.9 C, and 47.8% of the nerves were histologically injured. Using saline irrigation, thermal elevation was significantly suppressed up to 42.7 C (P < 0.01), and no nerve was histologically injured. When bipolar cauterization was performed in the perpendicular direction, temperature of the surrounding site reached only 40.4 C (P < 0.01). Locally injected corticosteroid reduced the incidence of nerve injury to 25.0%. However, a significant increase in nerve damage remained compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Bipolar cauterization near the nerve roots can increase the temperature of nerve roots and cause thermal nerve root injury, despite no accidental direct nerve root injury. Using saline irrigation, or setting bipolar forceps perpendicular to nerve roots, thermal elevation could be suppressed and nerve injury could be prevented. Therefore, it is recommended that surgeons set bipolar forceps perpendicular to nerve roots or use saline irrigation for the prevention of nerve root injury.

We generated recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) LC16m8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E), spike (S) proteins (rVV-NMES) and reported that old BALB/c mice having prior immunization with rVV-NMES develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rVV-NMES-immunized mice showed lower pulmonary viral titer than in the control mice. Furthermore, we determined which SARS-CoV structural protein for the prior rVV-immunization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the SARS-CoV infection as observed in the rVV-NMES-immunized mice. Old BALB/c mice were inoculated intradermally with rVV that expressed each structural proteins of SARS-CoV (rVV-N, -M, -E, or -S) with or without rVV-S and then infected intranasally with SARS-CoV more than 4 weeks later. At 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, the rVV-N-immunized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of Th1 (IL-2)- and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5)-bias cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-) were observed in rVV-N-immunized mice, resulting in the intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the lung. In contrast, rVV-S-immunized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia. However, the mice having co-immunization with both rVV-N and rVV-S showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral titer was low. These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection. These findings increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.","output":"Analysis of the mechanism by which BALB/c mice having prior immunization with nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV develop severe pneumonia after SARS-CoV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gut microbiome can be adversely affected by chemotherapy and antibiotics prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This affects graft success and increases susceptibility to multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization and infection. We performed an initial retrospective analysis of our use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors as therapy for MDRO-colonized patients with hematological malignancy. FMT was performed on eight MDRO-colonized patients pre-HCT (FMT-MDRO group), and outcomes compared with 11 MDRO colonized HCT patients from the same period. At 12 months, survival was significantly higher in the FMT-MDRO group (70% versus 36% p = 0.044). Post-HCT, fewer FMT-MDRO patients required intensive care (0% versus 46%, P = 0.045) or experienced fever (0.29 versus 0.11 days, P = 0.027). Intestinal MDRO decolonization occurred in 25% of FMT-MDRO patients versus 11% non-FMT MDRO patients. Despite the significant differences and statistically comparable patient/transplant characteristics, as the sample size was small, a matched-pair analysis between both groups to non-MDRO colonized control cohorts (2:1 matching) was performed. At 12 months, the MDRO group who did not have an FMT had significantly lower survival (36.4% versus 61.9% respectively, p=0.012), and higher non relapse mortality (NRM; 60.2% versus 16.7% respectively, p=0.009) than their paired non-MDRO-colonized cohort. Conversely, there was no difference in survival (70% versus 43.4%, p=0.14) or NRM (12.5% versus 31.2% respectively, p=0.24) between the FMT-MDRO group and their paired non-MDRO cohort. Collectively, these data suggest that negative clinical outcomes, including mortality associated with MDRO colonization, may be ameliorated by pre-HCT FMT, even in the absence of intestinal MDRO decolonization. Further work is needed to explore this observed benefit.","output":"Fecal Microbiota Transplant Mitigates Adverse Outcomes Seen in Patients Colonized With Multidrug-Resistant Organisms Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to report on the long-term effects of pexidartinib on tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT).

It is important to identify high-risk residence communities and the risk factors for decision making on targeted prevention and control measures. In this paper, the number of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in the residence communities in Wuhan, China was collected together with the characteristic variables of the residence communities and the distances between the residence communities and nearby crowded places. The correlation analysis was conducted between the number of confirmed cases and the characteristic/distance variables. Concerning the characteristic variables, there are significant positive correlations between the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the construction area, covered area, total number of houses, total number of buildings, volume ratio, property charge, and number of second-hand houses in the residence communities in Wuhan, while minor or no correlation is observed for the average price of houses, construction year, greening ratio, or number of sold houses. Concerning the distance variables, there are significant negative correlations between the number of confirmed cases and the distances from the residence communities to the nearest universities, business clusters, and railway stations, while minor or no correlation is observed for the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, shopping malls, cinemas, subway stations, bus stops, inter-city bus stations, airport, general hospitals, or appointed hospitals for COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the residence communities which are newly-built, where the volume ratio or property charge is high or the construction area, covered area, or total number of houses, buildings, second-hand houses, or sold houses is large, or which are close to universities, business clusters, subway stations, or railway stations are the high-risk ones where strict measures should be taken.

Few publications exist concerning the treatment of gastric leak. We sought to determine by way of a prospective study the clinical presentation, postoperative course, and treatment of gastric leak after LSG for obesity. METHODS From October 2005 to August 2008, 214 patients with different degrees of obesity underwent LSG. During surgery, each patient received saline with methylene blue by way of nasogastric tube and had a drain placed. All patients underwent radiologic study with liquid barium sulphate on postoperative day 3. RESULTS Seven patients developed gastric leak. Leak in two patients (28.6%) was diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) study. Two patients had type I leak (28.6%), and five patients had type II leak (71.4%). Four patients underwent reoperation. Three patients were managed medically with enteral or parenteral feeding; the drain was maintained in situ; and collections were drained by percutaneous punctions guided by computed axial tomography. Mean hospital length of stay was 28.8 days, and time to leakage closure was 43 days after surgery. CONCLUSION Different ways exist to manage gastric leak, depending on the magnitude of the collection and the clinical repercussions. When treatment necessitates reintervention and is performed early, suture repair is more likely to be successful. Leakage closure time will vary.","output":"Gastric leak after laparoscopic-sleeve gastrectomy for obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the final achievements of an Education project granted by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Commission (EC), focused in particular on three fields that are considered enablers for Smart Cities (SCs): Telecommunications and Computer Networks, IT Security, and Smart Grids (SGs) Policy makers and stakeholders in Palestine (PS) have made the decision to move towards a knowledge-based economy with the aim of providing a rapid but sustainable economic growth Thanks to the EU funding, it was possible to transfer know-how from European experts to PS and to enhance the capacity building and skills of professors, students, and industry employees Although the Covid-19 pandemic has compelled to delay some activities related to Academia-Industry cooperation, like the students' stages at European universities and enterprises, the academic activities have been developed as planned, just accelerating the adaptation of the didactic material to remote learning, phase that was already included in the initial project plan The paper analyzes the structure and content of the developed didactic material, and the corresponding students' feedback after the first year of courses delivery ? 2020 IEEE","output":"E-Academy to support Smart Cities Operations in Palestine (eSCO) project: Final achievements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally and has severely impacted public health and the economy. Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus.","output":"Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater: Concerns and tactics for treatment to effectively control the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue engineering is an evolving multi-disciplinary field with cutting-edge technologies and innovative scientific perceptions that promise functional regeneration of damaged tissues/organs.

Methods: Patients who underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery at our hospital between July-August 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (first UK wave of COVID-19) were identified retrospectively and grouped by year of operation. Type of operation was recorded, including time for sending, anaesthetic induction, surgical preparation, operating time, and time for transfer to recovery. The two groups were compared for analysis. Results: Case numbers were similar in both 2019 and 2020 (215vs.213 operations), with a similar proportion being hip fractures (39.1% and 36.6%), respectively. Median sending time (40vs.23 minutes, P <0.00001) and induction time (13vs.8 minutes, P<0.00001) were increased in 2020, a 74% and 63% increase compared to 2019, respectively.

The pandemic has led to many social and health-care challenges. In this context, surgery is an area that is facing the need for many adaptations. In this systematic literature review, we analyzed different perspectives concerning this situation, aiming to provide recommendations that could guide surgeons and entities toward screening, elective and emergency surgeries, decision making, and operating room management. A computerized search in PubMed, Scopus, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for relevant literature up to April 4, 2020, was performed. Articles were included if they were related to surgery dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 281 articles found in our initial search and 15 articles from alternative sources, 39 were included in our review after a systematic evaluation. Concerning preoperative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 29 (74.4%) articles recommended some kind of screening. Another major suggestion was postponing all (or at least selected) elective operations (29 articles, 74.4%). Several additional recommendations with respect to surgical practice or surgical staff were also assessed and discussed, such as performing laparoscopic surgeries and avoiding the use of electrocauterization. On the basis of the current literature, we concluded that any surgery that can be delayed should be postponed. COVID-19 screening is strongly recommended for all surgical cases. Moreover, surgical staff should be reduced to the essential members and provided with institutional psychological support.","output":"Surgical Practice in the Current COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has added new urgency to the study of viral mechanisms of infection. But while vaccines offer a measure of protection against this specific outbreak, a new era of pandemics has been predicted. In addition to this, COVID-19 has drawn attention to post-viral syndromes and the healthcare burden they entail. It seems integral that knowledge of viral mechanisms is increased through as wide a research field as possible. To this end we propose that quantum biology might offer essential new insights into the problem, especially with regards to the important first step of virus-host invasion. Research in quantum biology often centres around energy or charge transfer. While this is predominantly in the context of photosynthesis there has also been some suggestion that cellular receptors such as olfactory or neural receptors might employ vibration assisted electron tunnelling to augment the lock-and-key mechanism. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme function. Enzymes are implicated in the invasion of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Receptors such as olfactory receptors also appear to be disrupted by COVID-19. Building on these observations we investigate the evidence that quantum tunnelling might be important in the context of infection with SARS-CoV-2. We illustrate this with a simple model relating the vibronic mode of, for example, a viral spike protein to the likelihood of charge transfer in an idealised receptor. Our results show a distinct parameter regime in which the vibronic mode of the spike protein enhances electron transfer. With this in mind, novel therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission could potentially be identified by their vibrational spectra.","output":"Bad vibrations: Quantum tunnelling in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pneumococcal colonisation is regarded as a pre-requisite for developing pneumococcal disease. In children previous studies have reported pneumococcal colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses the experimental human pneumococcal challenge (EHPC) model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. METHODS: Healthy participants aged 18C50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between the two groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. RESULTS: Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with serotype 6B, 17 with serotype 23F) and 8 received saline (control). In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with serotype 6B. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p = 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p = 0.28) between the inoculation group and the control group. In those who were colonised there was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised, with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses, there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p = 0.74 and virus negative p = 1.0). CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal colonisation using the EHPC model is asymptomatic in healthy adults, regardless of pneumococcal density or viral co-colonisation.","output":"Pneumococcal colonisation is an asymptomatic event in healthy adults using an experimental human colonisation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is undergoing an unprecedented shock as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns in nearly all economies As major world economies are being put on hold, millions of jobs and incomes are being lost, which has created an imperative for economic policy actions Government healthcare responses have so far been aimed at containment with measures aimed at slowing the rate of infection and limiting social and work-related interactions, accompanied by fiscal and monetary policies to support businesses and protect peoples incomes Despite these measures, it is becoming clear that the economic and social consequences of the current crisis will be profound and long lasting, and still largely uncertain, and highlight the extent to which the economic crisis is transmitted not only through domestic policies but the severe disruption to trade in global supply chains, which account for two thirds of world trade (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez, 2015) Countries, regions, industries, and socio-economic groups will be unevenly affected Global trade is expected to fall between 13 and 32 per cent in 2020, according to the World Trade Organisation (WTO, 2020) As Covid-19 constitutes a vivid example of an unexpected shock with global reach, Brexit will continue, once this crisis is over, to shape the domestic and EU economies, as a new economic and political relationship is established between the UK and the EU Both these events, in sequence and taken together, undoubtedly imply widespread changes to the way in which countries and firms will trade in future decades, which will recognise the globalised scope of shocks, with a possible revival of protectionist measures coming into frame (Evenett and Fritz, 2019) Were this to happen, poorer countries that have arguably benefitted the most from globalisation may suffer from a retreat","output":"Global Value Chains and Economic Dislocations: Introduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused trillions of dollars in damages to the governments and health authorities by affecting the global economies.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was designed in conjunction with the CSF Leak Association patient charity. The survey included questions on diagnosis, investigations and treatments received, as well as validated disability and quality of life questionnaires. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SIH who were receiving treatment within the UK were included in the analysis. The mean age was 42.8 years, 94% were female and 43 had ongoing symptoms of SIH. RESULTS: Patients who presented to their general practitioner with symptoms of SIH were seen an average three times before being referred to a specialist, and in just under half of patients, the diagnosis was not made by the first specialist they saw. There was variability in which investigations were performed and how urgently they were organised. The mean EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analogue Scale score was 36.4/100 and median Headache Impact Test-6 score was 68/78 (very severe impact).

METHODS For this case-control matched study, consecutive patients aged 18-90 years and admitted to nine nationwide hospitals with acute ischemic stroke between December 2008 and June 2010, were enrolled as cases. Controls, individually matched by age and sex, were chosen from the 4th Korean National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-2010). Based on odds ratios and prevalence, standardized according to the age and sex structure of the Korean population, PARs of major risk factors were estimated according to age (young,  45; middle-aged, 46-65; and elderly,  66 years) and sex subgroups. RESULTS In 4,743 matched case-control sets, smoking (PAR, 45.1%) was the greatest contributing risk factor in young men, followed by hypertension (28.5%). In middle-aged men, the greatest contributing factors were smoking (37.4%), hypertension (22.7%), and diabetes (14.6%), whereas in women the greatest factors were hypertension (22.7%) and stroke history (10.6%). In the elderly, hypertension was the leading factor in men (23.7%) and women (23.4%). Other noticeable factors were stroke history (men, 19.7%; women, 17.3%) and diabetes (men, 12.5%; women, 15.1%). In young women, risk factors with a PAR greater than 10% were not found.

This study evaluates the perioperative outcome and the learning curves for two surgeons while introducing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS Morbidly obese patients undergoing primary LRYGB were included. Lengths of surgery and postoperative hospital stay, and 30-day rates of morbidity, reoperations, and readmissions were set as indicators of the learning curve. Learning effects were evaluated by graphical analyses and comparing the first and last 40 procedures for both surgeons. RESULTS The 292 included patients had a mean age of 40.0 +/- 9.5 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 46.7 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2). The mean length of surgery was 101 +/- 55 min. Complications occurred in 43 patients (14.7%), with no conversions to open surgery in the primary procedure and no mortality. Reoperations were performed in 14 patients (4.8%), of which five patients required open surgery. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 1-77), and 19 patients (6.5%) were readmitted. High patient age, but not high BMI, was associated with an increased risk of complication. For both surgeons, lengths of surgery and hospital stay were significantly reduced (p < 0.001), leveling out after 100 procedures.

The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of COVID-19 suggest this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients (1). This study aims to compare the outcomes of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method: We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in four different North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. All clinically relevant outcomes were then compared to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (12th March- 7th April 2020). Results: A total of 52 electronic patient records during the study time period were reviewed. Cohort A (median age 76 years, 56% males) and cohort B (median age 58 years, 62% male) comprised of 26 patients each. With the exclusion of cancer, both had a median of 2 comorbidities. Within cohort A, the most frequent underlying cancer was colorectal (5/26) and prostate cancer (5/26), and 77% of patients in Cohort A had received previous anti-cancer therapy. The most common presenting symptoms were cough and pyrexia in both cohorts. Frequent laboratory findings included lymphopenia, anaemia and elevated CRP in both cohorts, whilst hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia was predominantly seen amongst patients with cancer. Median duration of admission was 7 days in both cohorts. The mortality rate was the same in both cohorts (23%), with median age of mortality of 80 years. Of cancer patients who died, all were advanced stage, had been treated with palliative intent and had received anti-cancer therapy within 13 days of admission. Conclusion: Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. Whilst extra caution is warranted in the administration of anti-cancer therapies pertaining to the risk of immune-suppression, this data does not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts.","output":"Outcomes of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in patients with or without a history of cancer - a multi-centre North London experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The absence of standardized treatment for critical children admitted in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with COVID could lead to an increase in antimicrobial consumption, as indirect effect.

DESIGN: ACTION is an academic-led, pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase IV clinical trial that aims to enroll around 600 patients at 40 sites participating in the Coalition COVID-19 Brazil initiative. Eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms up to 14 days and elevated D-dimer levels will be randomized to a strategy of full-dose anticoagulation for 30 days with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or full-dose heparin if oral administration is not feasible) vs standard of care with any approved venous thromboembolism prophylaxis regimen during hospitalization. A confirmation of COVID-19 was mandatory for study entry, based on specific tests used in clinical practice (RT-PCR, antigen test, IgM test) collected before randomization, regardless of in the outpatient setting or not. Randomization will be stratified by clinical stability at presentation. The primary outcome is a hierarchical analysis of mortality, length of hospital stay, or duration of oxygen therapy at the end of 30 days.

For these reasons, active administration of anticoagulants (such as heparin) is recommended to patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of different doses of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study was performed retrospectively in intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) positive (+) patients were included in the study. Patients demographic data, length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit, laboratory values (D-dimer, CRP, creatinine) on the last day of intensive care stay, mortality and invasive mechanical ventilator needs were recorded. Group O: consisted of patients not receiving anticoagulants, and Group 1 received a single daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin sodium (equivalent to 4000 anti-Xa IU), and Group 2 received 2 daily doses of 1 mg/kg enoxaparin sodium. Results: A total of 191 patients were included in the study. 45% of the patients were female (n: 86), 55% were male. The mean age was found to be 67.6  13.8. Patient numbers;group 0: 12, group 1: 90, group 2: 89. 7-day mortality was 50% in group 0, 22.2% in group 2, and 23.5% in group 3 (p value &lt;0.05). Conclusion: In a recent lung dissection report in critically ill patient with COVID-19;occlusion of pulmonary small vessels and formation of microthrombosis have been demonstrated.

However, it is not known how robust these rate estimates are to inaccuracies in the data, particularly in sampling dates that are used for molecular clock calibration. Here we report on the rate of evolution of the emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which has significantly different rates of evolution for the same outer capsid (VP60) gene published in the literature. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of RHDV s evolutionary history, we undertook fresh Bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV based on the VP60 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. RESULTS: Through these control methods, we were able to identify a single misdated taxon, a passaged lab strain used for vaccine production, which was responsible for depressing the RHDV capsid genes rate of evolution by 65%. Without this isolate, the polymerase and the capsid protein genes had nearly identical rates of evolution: 1.90x10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, ns/s/y, (95% highest probability density (HPD) 1.25x10(-3)-2.55x10(-3)) and 1.91x10(-3) ns/s/y (95% HPD 1.50x10(-3)-2.34x10(-3)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of RHDV, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus. The control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates. These jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous dates of isolation.","output":"One misdated sequence of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus prevents accurate estimation of its nucleotide substitution rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host response to infection is known to be influenced by many factors, including genetics, nutritional status, age, as well as drug and chemical exposures. Recent advances reveal that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulates aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral, bacterial, and parasitic organisms. Although many of these observations were made using the high affinity but poorly metabolized AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), not all of the effects are detrimental to the host. Sometimes AhR activation, even with TCDD, was beneficial and improved host resistance and survival. A similar dichotomy is observed in infected AhR-deficient mice, wherein absence of functional AhR sometimes, but not always, alters host resistance. When examined in their totality, current data indicate that AhR controls multiple regulatory pathways that converge with infection-associated signals and depending on the context (e.g., type of pathogen, site of infection), lead to distinct outcomes. This creates numerous exciting opportunities to harness the immunomodulatory action of AhR to transform host responses to infection. Moreover, since many of the mechanisms cued in response to infectious agents are pivotal in the context of other diseases, there is much to be learned about AhR's cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of action.","output":"New insights into the aryl hydrocarbon receptor as a modulator of host responses to infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The kallikrein\\\\kinin system is involved in many (patho)physiological processes and kinin peptides are considered potential clinical biomarkers. Variance in blood specimen collection and processing, artificial ex vivo bradykinin formation, and rapid degradation of kinins have contributed to divergence in published plasma levels, therefore limiting their significance. Thus, reliable preanalytical settings are highly required. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a standardized preanalytical procedure for reliable kinin quantification. The procedure was based on identification of the most impactful variables on ex vivo plasma level alterations. METHODS: Suitable protease inhibitors and blood specimen collection and handling conditions were systematically investigated. Their influence on plasma levels of seven kinins was monitored using an established in\\\\house liquid chromatographyCtandem mass spectrometry platform. RESULTS: In nonstandardized settings, ex vivo rise of bradykinin was found to already occur 30 seconds after blood sampling with high interindividual variation. The screening of 17 protease inhibitors resulted in a customized seven\\\\component protease inhibitor, which efficiently stabilized ex vivo kinin levels. The reliability of kinin levels was substantially jeopardized by prolonged rest time until centrifugation, phlebotomy methodology (eg, straight needles, catheters), vacuum sampling technique, or any time delays during venipuncture. The subsequently developed standardized procedure was applied to healthy volunteers and proved it significantly limited interday and interindividual kinin level variability. CONCLUSION: The developed procedure for blood specimen collection and handling is feasible in clinical settings and allows for determination of reliable kinin levels.

One tempting working hypothesis is that pathological changes in the peripheral olfactory system where the body is exposed to many adverse environmental stressors may have a causal role for the brain alteration. Whether and how the peripheral pathology spreads to more central brain regions may be effectively studied in rodent models, and there is successful precedence in experimental models for Parkinson's disease. It is of interest to study whether a similar mechanism may underlie the pathology of psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia. However, direct comparison between rodent models and humans includes challenges under light of comparative neuroanatomy and experimental methodologies used in these two distinct species. We believe that neuroimaging modality that has been the main methodology of human brain studies may be a useful viewpoint to address and fill the knowledge gap between rodents and humans in this scientific question. Accordingly, in the present review article, we focus on brain imaging studies associated with olfaction in healthy humans and patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and if available those in rodents. We organize this review article at three levels: 1) olfactory bulb (OB) and peripheral structures of the olfactory system, 2) primary olfactory cortical and subcortical regions, and 3) associated higher-order cortical regions. This research area is still underdeveloped, and we acknowledge that further validation with independent cohorts may be needed for many studies presented here, in particular those with human subjects. Nevertheless, whether and how peripheral olfactory disturbance impacts brain function is becoming even a hotter topic in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, given the risk of long-term changes of mental status associated with olfactory infection of SARS-CoV-2. Together, in this review article, we introduce this underdeveloped but important research area focusing on its implications in neurological and psychiatric disorders, with several pioneered publications.","output":"A comparative neuroimaging perspective of olfaction and higher-order olfactory processing: on health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines constitute highly effective tools for controlling and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and are assessed to avert between two to three million deaths per year globally.

In connection with the ordinance of the Minister of Health of 13 March 2020 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 433), announcing the state of epidemic threat in the territory of the Republic of Poland, common units of the prosecutor's office faced a new challenge regarding a quick and effective response to crimes arising in connection with the use of the state of emergency for unlawful purposes. Certainly, for people who act against the law, this is a typical opportunity, a situation that can be used to generate spectacular profits. On the other hand, for law-enforcing organizations, the state of epidemic threat is, if not a crisis, certainly an emergency situation. Apart from the specific dichotomy that emerged as part of the analysis carried out for this article (the relationship between opportunity and crisis), the actions taken in the public entity during the crisis caused by COVID-19 are worth presented.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the electrophysiologic findings and arrhythmias associated with pediatric COVID-19 and its treatment. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review was undertaken and included all patients with (1) symptoms of COVID-19 and (2) PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 who were placed on continuous telemetry for the duration of their hospitalization during March through May, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. Significant arrhythmias were found in 6 (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 5 and sustained atrial tachycardia in 1). All were self-resolving and half prompted prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients with significant arrhythmias were likely to have noncardiac comorbidities (4/6), but these were not more common than in patients without arrhythmias (20/30, P = 1). The use of HCQ was associated with statistically significant QTc prolongation (413  19 ms vs 425  16 ms, P =.005). QTc was not statistically different in patients with and without arrhythmias (425  15 ms vs 425  15 ms, P = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with PCR-positive active COVID-19 infection, significant arrhythmias are infrequent, but are more common than expected in a general pediatric population. Comorbidities are not more common in patients with arrhythmias than in patients without arrhythmias.

Authors present an overview of the library services that were organized continuously all the time and some new ones that were introduced and implemented in order to satisfy various social, cultural, educational, and even psycho-logical needs of their users. The abovementioned services were analyzed and compared to library services implemented on the national and international levels. The authors have also presented their example of best practice in creating high-impact communication and gave an overview of results of quantitative and content analysis of e-mail communication with users and all press releases. Findings. The comparison of library services that were organized continuously and the new ones with library services implemented on national and international levels have shown a high level of compatibility and consistency, while the results of quanti-tative and content analysis of communication with users and all press releases confirm reasonableness of the used model of impact management and high-impact communica-tion. Practical implications. Practical implications of the presented impact management and library management examples of best practice and results are immense for all public libraries in Croatia. Social implications. The impact of COVID-19 on library management is unprece-dented, causing closure of all libraries and organization of services under strict preven-tive measures and social distancing. The management of the Zagreb City Libraries was even more aggravated due to an earthquake that hit Zagreb in March and the floods that occurred in July.

Methods: Eye bank operations were temporarily halted in March after the government-mandated \\"Lockdown\\" in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Before restarting eye bank operations in May, we studied sources of exposure, performed risk assessment, instituted additional process validations and redefined the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in consultation with the guidelines published by the Eye bank Association of India and All India Ophthalmological Society. The eye bank staff were rigorously trained before and after operations were restarted. We conducted a survey at the end of July to gauge staff attitude and reaction. Results: Eye banks services resumed on 20th May 2020. Since reopening till the end of July total 41 keratoplasties have been done. 91.75% of all keratoplasties done were therapeutic surgeries and 17% of the surgeries were done using glycerine preserved tissues. No staff had COVID-19 symptoms when the operations restarted and none developed symptoms up to the end of July. All eye bank staff were aware of COVID-19 pandemic and 86% said they felt safe working at the eye bank. 86% of the staff said that they received adequate training and 66% of the staff expressed that they always received proper PPE and kits. Overall, 93% of the staff expressed that the measures taken by the eye bank ensured their safety. Conclusion: Based on our experience we suggest the following activities for planned resumption of eye bank services during the pandemic: Exposure Risk Analysis, Personal Protective Equipment usage training, SOP Revision and staff training on modified SOPs.

As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but in patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia, COVID-19 disease can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but can also harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call on our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously.

These studies highlighted that the tidal volume can be estimated by using different technologies ranging from IMUs to strain sensors (e.g., resistive, capacitive, inductive, electromagnetic, and optical) or acoustic sensors. Noticeably, the relative volumetric error of these solutions during quasi-static tasks (e.g., resting and sitting) is typically &#8805;10% but it deteriorates during dynamic motor tasks (e.g., walking). As such, additional efforts are required to improve the performance of these devices and to identify possible applications based on their accuracy and reliability.","output":"Assessing the Tidal Volume through Wearables: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patients with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to investigate cancer incidence in patients with COVID-19 and to determine whether cancer was associated with mortality among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and medRxiv were conducted to collect studies that provided data regarding the incidence and mortality of cancer patients with COVID-19. Meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled incidences, risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity among studies was detected using I(2) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 19 retrospective studies involving 63,019 patients (2,682 patients with cancer) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled incidence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 6% (95% CI: 3%C9%). The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with cancer was higher than that of those without cancer [risk ratio (RR): 1.8, 95% CI: 1.38C2.35, P < 0.01]. Studies on specific types of cancer showed that among COVID-19 patients, the mortality rate of lung cancer patients was higher than that of patients without lung cancer (RR: 1.8, 95% CI: 0.85C3.80, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer were more susceptible to COVID-19. As a risk factor, cancer increased mortality among COVID-19 patients. Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, those who had lung cancer had a higher mortality than those without lung cancer. Our findings suggested that clinicians should pay more attention to cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and provide useful information for their clinical management.","output":"Effects of cancer on patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 63,019 participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a popular method from graph representation learning that have proved effective for tasks like node classification tasks. Although typical GCN models focus on classifying nodes within a static graph, several recent variants propose node classification in dynamic graphs whose topologies and node attributes change over time, e.g., social networks with dynamic relationships, or literature citation networks with changing co-authorships. These works, however, do not fully address the challenge of flexibly assigning different importance to snapshots of the graph at different times, which depending on the graph dynamics may have more or less predictive power on the labels. We address this challenge by proposing a new method, GCN-SE, that attaches a set of learnable attention weights to graph snapshots at different times, inspired by Squeeze and Excitation Net (SE-Net). We show that GCN-SE outperforms previously proposed node classification methods on a variety of graph datasets. To verify the effectiveness of the attention weight in determining the importance of different graph snapshots, we adapt perturbation-based methods from the field of explainable machine learning to graphical settings and evaluate the correlation between the attention weights learned by GCN-SE and the importance of different snapshots over time. These experiments demonstrate that GCN-SE can in fact identify different snapshots' predictive power for dynamic node classification.","output":"GCN-SE: Attention as Explainability for Node Classification in Dynamic Graphs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Aotearoa health inequities for Mori are seen across the life course These inequities are influenced by the social determinants of health and the cumulative effects of colonisation Total cardiovascular disease mortality rate among Mori is more than twice as high as that among non-Mori Maintaining a healthy nutrition lifestyle is important to reduce the risk of CVD This presentation will discuss the literature and oral narratives from three disparate sources of nutrition advice mtauranga (knowledge) Mori, Western science, and social media as part of a discussion of a larger Heart Foundation funded kaupapa Mori research project Method: The review was conducted in three parts 1) A literature search of the current evidence base of nutrition recommendations and guidelines, 2) Utilisation of community partners and networks within Mori health to collect information about mtauranga Mori in nutrition Discussions with kaumatua (elders) and others in the Mori community who hold traditional knowledge A search of oral sources of mtauranga, for example whakatauki (proverbs) and karakia (prayers) looking for nutrition or food references, 3) An appraisal of popular social media and current trends in the non-evidence-based nutrition space Results: The results will highlight the findings of the review and provide some detail from focus group sessions with communities Conclusion: To effectively navigate nutrition advice, it needs to be tailored in a way that is acceptable to the community Building the Mori nutrition evidence base in order to inform policy makers and the design of nutrition programmes for Mori is recommended","output":"How Do Mori Navigate Advice About Nutrition?

Local health impacts depend on a large number of factors including specific regional climate impacts, demographics and human vulnerabilities, and existing local adaptation capacity. There is a need to incorporate local data and concerns into climate adaptation plans and evaluate different approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided funding, technical assistance, and an adaptation framework to assist localities with climate planning and activities. The differing processes with which states, cities, and tribes develop and implement adaptation plans have been observed. We outline examples of the implementation of CDCs framework and activities for local adaptation, with a focus on case studies at differing jurisdictional levels (a state, a city, and a sovereign tribe).

It is handled by persons with different hygiene standards and can transit in different environments. Hence, money can constitute a reservoir for different types of human pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Algerian banknotes to shelter opportunistic pathogenic and multiresistant bacteria. To that end, 200 circulating notes of four different denominations were collected from various places and analyzed for their bacterial loads and contents. Besides, predominant strains were identified and characterized by biochemical and molecular methods, and their resistance profiles against 34 antibiotics were determined. Our results indicated that 100% of the studied banknotes were contaminated with bacteria. The total bacterial concentrations were relatively high, and different bacterial groups were grown, showing important diversity. In total, 48 predominant strains were identified as belonging to 17 genera. Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were the most prevalent genera, followed by Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all the isolates harbored resistance to at least two molecules, and worrying resistance levels were observed. These findings prove that Algerian currency harbors opportunistic multiresistant bacteria and could potentially act as a vehicle for the spread of bacterial diseases and as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes among the community. Therefore, no cash payment systems should be developed and generalized to minimize cash handling and subsequent potential health risks.","output":"Multidrug-resistant Opportunistic and Pathogenic Bacteria Contaminate Algerian Banknotes Currency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutual proximity and exposure time can provide critical information to assess the risk of propagation of highly contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV2.

Although promising, the high variability of the radio propagation channel for ISM-band technologies suggests that a deep analysis of BLE is needed in order to isolate the different propagation factors. In this paper we show, through extensive measurements, the fluctuation of BLE channel in various environments and provide a ray tracing model to fully capture the BLE channel behavior. Results show how unpredictable BLE measurements become at increasing distances and under different positioning configurations, leading to misleading detections for contact tracing apps.

Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has decreased considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for the identification of viraemic carriers and to effective vaccines. Infection Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30C40% will develop persistent viraemia, 30C40% show transient viraemia and 20C30% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection. Disease signs The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2C3 years. Diagnosis In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host. Vaccination recommendations All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8C9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later. The ABCD suggests that, in cats older than 3C4 years of age, a booster every 2C3 years suffices, in view of the significantly lower susceptibility of older cats.","output":"Feline leukaemia.

We determined which baseline angiography features predict response to intravenous thrombolytics in ischemic stroke using randomized controlled trial data. METHODS We analyzed angiograms from the IST-3 (Third International Stroke Trial), an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial of intravenous alteplase. Readers, masked to clinical, treatment, and outcome data, assessed prerandomization computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography for presence, extent, location, and completeness of obstruction and collaterals. We compared angiography findings to 6-month functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and tested for interactions with alteplase, using ordinal regression in adjusted analyses. We also meta-analyzed all available angiography data from other randomized controlled trials of intravenous thrombolytics. RESULTS In IST-3, 300 patients had prerandomization angiography (computed tomographic angiography=271 and magnetic resonance angiography=29). On multivariable analysis, more extensive angiographic obstruction and poor collaterals independently predicted poor outcome (P<0.01). We identified no significant interaction between angiography findings and alteplase effect on Oxford Handicap Scale (P0.075) in IST-3. In meta-analysis (5 trials of alteplase or desmoteplase, including IST-3, n=591), there was a significantly increased benefit of thrombolytics on outcome (odds ratio>1 indicates benefit) in patients with (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.64; P=0.011) versus without (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.35; P=0.566) arterial obstruction (P for interaction 0.017).

Most published literature focuses on adults with COVID-19, but little is understood on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We created a database for children with COVID-19 at Childrens Hospital Colorado (CHCO), a large tertiary care pediatric hospital, to better understand the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of this disease in children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all pediatric and youth patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results from March-May 2020. Univariate logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of hospital admission, need for critical care, and need for respiratory support among symptomatic patients, with p-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients with SARS-CoV-2 (age range: 17 days-25 years). We noted a Hispanic predominance with 68% of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 identifying as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 29% among all CHCO visits in 2019 (Figure 1). The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, or shortness of breath in 94% of symptomatic patients. Sixty-eight patients (28%) were admitted, of which 7 (10%) required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for symptomatic COVID-19 disease (Figure 2). Age 0C3 months, certain symptoms at presentation, and several types of underlying medical conditions were predictors for both hospital admission and need for respiratory support (Figure 3). Initial and peak C-reactive protein (CRP) values were predictors for PICU admission with median peaks of 24.8mg/dL vs. 2.0mg/dL among PICU vs. non-PICU patients (OR 1.27, p=0.004).

A questionnaire was carried out in the University of Malta Faculties of Health Sciences, Dentistry and Medicine to ascertain degree of vaccine hesitancy vis--vis influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was sent through the faculty Deans and the respective secretaries via Google forms. RESULTS: The response rate was 23% (n = 852). The percentages of who took the influenza vaccine last year and who will take it this year increased at all ages, highest for Medicine and Academics. For COVID-19 vaccination, unlikely, undecided and likely to take were 30.5/25.3/44.2% respectively. Medicine and Academics was also likeliest to take, as were males overall. The proportion of those likelier to take the COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were related to insufficient knowledge about such a vaccine and potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The increased influenza vaccine uptake is unsurprising in view of the current heightened awareness of respiratory disease. The hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination is of concern particularly in this health related group who should be better informed. The association of vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 with influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy.

The time to enhancement, classified as early pulmonary-arterial (PA) pattern of enhancement versus delayed bronchial-arterial (BA) pattern of enhancement, the extent of enhancement, classified as marked or reduced, the homogeneity of enhancement, classified as homogeneous or inhomogeneous, and the decrease of enhancement, classified as rapid washout (<120 seconds) or a late washout (120 seconds), were analyzed retrospectively. Furthermore, the tissue samples from the study patients and as a control group, 10 samples of normal lung tissue obtained by autopsy, and 10 samples of lung tissue with acute pneumonia obtained by autopsy were immunohistochemically stained with CD34 antibody. The presence of avascular areas (AAs) and the VPs were evaluated in all tissue samples. RESULTS On CEUS, all PPGLs showed a reduced inhomogeneous BA pattern of enhancement and a rapid washout (<120 seconds). On CD34 staining, all PPGLs showed central AAs in granulomas and a chaotic VP similar to angiogenesis in lung tumors. The lung tissue in control groups revealed on CD34 staining a regular alveolar VP. CONCLUSION The PPGLs on CEUS show an identical perfusion pattern similar to those of malignant lesions.

We aim to assess the PH toward children COVID-19 vaccination as compared to PH toward children routine vaccination among the residents of Saudi Arabia. METHOD: Before the official approval of children's COVID-19 vaccination in the country, a cross-sectional study using an electronically distributed survey was performed. Responses from parents of children younger than 18 years of age were accepted. The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale (OC19-VHS) and the routine vaccination hesitancy scale (R-VHS) were used. Parents were classified as hesitant, non-hesitant, and unsure. RESULTS: Between June 18th?30th, 2021, we included 1,052 parents. More than half of the parents were positive toward the childhood COVID-19 vaccination (63%) while 10% were unsure. Higher parental hesitancy toward children COVID-19 vaccination among mothers, parents younger than 40 years, did not receive COVID-19 nor influenza vaccines, had higher educational levels, and parents who recovered from COVID-19 infection. Hesitancy was mainly driven by the novelty of the vaccines and the fear of serious adverse effects. Compared to the routine vaccination, parents were more hesitant toward COVID-19 vaccination (6 vs. 27%).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of consensus among Italian pediatricians on different topics related to treatment of fever in children by using the Delphi technique. METHODS: A Delphi study was undertaken between June and September 2021, when two questionnaires were consecutively sent to a panel of experts to be answered anonymously. An invitation to participate was sent to 500 pediatricians distributed over the whole national territory and 80 (16%) of them accepted to participate on a voluntary basis. The questionnaires were structured into three specific topics: therapeutic appropriateness and management of the febrile child, management of the febrile child in the presence of other diseases, and future perspectives in remote management. Each topic had six statements. RESULTS: A first-round questionnaire was sent to 80 accepting pediatricians from different Italian regions. Of the 72 respondents (23% working in hospitals and 72% outside), 33% were from northern, 12% central, and 55% southern Italy or islands. A second-round questionnaire was sent to the same 80 pediatricians and 69 of them responded, without significant differences for workplaces or geographical distribution as compared with the first questionnaire. Overall, 75 participants answered at least one of the two questionnaires. All the statements on the topics of therapeutic appropriateness and management of the febrile child and future perspectives in remote management reached the predefined cut off for consensus (75% or more). Only one statement on management of the febrile child in the presence of other diseases did not achieve the consensus even after the second round.

Quaternization stands out as an alternative to modify this natural polymer, aiming to improve its solubility over a wide pH range and, consequently, expand its range of applications. Quaternization occurs by introducing a quaternary ammonium moiety onto or outside the chitosan backbone, via chemical reactions with primary amino and hydroxyl groups, under vast experimental conditions. The oldest and most common forms of quaternized chitosan involve N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) and N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethyl ammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC) and, more recently, quaternized chitosan by insertion of pyridinium or phosphonium salts. By modifying chitosan through the insertion of a quaternary moiety, permanent cationic charges on the polysaccharide backbone are achieved and properties such as water solubility, antimicrobial activity, mucoadhesiveness and permeability are significantly improved, enabling the application mainly in the biomedical and pharmaceutical areas. In this review, the main quaternized chitosan compounds are addressed in terms of their structure, properties, synthesis routes and applications.

In this prospective study, we describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, disease course, management, and outcome in a large cohort of BS patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. We defined a cohort of 1047 registered BS patients who were aged between 16 and 60 years and seen routinely before the pandemic at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic. We followed prospectively this cohort from beginning of April 2020 until the end of April 2021. During 13 months of follow-up, of the 1047 (599 M/448 F) patients, 592 (56.5%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR at least once and 215 (20.5%; 95% CI 0.18C0.23) were tested positive. We observed 2 peaks which took place in December 2020 and April 2021. Of the 215 PCR positive patients, complete information was available in 214. Of these 214, 14 (6.5%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19. In the remaining, the most common symptoms were anosmia, fatigue, fever, arthralgia, and headache. A total of 40 (18.7%) had lung involvement, 25 (11.7%) were hospitalized, 1 was admitted to the intensive care unit while none died. Favipiravir was the most prescribed drug (74.3%), followed by colchicine (40.2%), and hydroxychloroquine (20.1%) in the treatment of COVID-19. After COVID-19, 5 patients (2.3%) were given supplemental O(2) and 31 (14.5%) antiaggregant or anticoagulants. During COVID-19, of the 214 PCR positive patients, 116 (54.2%) decreased the dose of their immunosuppressives or stopped taking completely; 36 (16.8%) experienced a BS flare which was mostly oral ulcers (10.3%). None of the patients reported a thrombotic event. A total of 93 (43.5%) patients reported BS flares after a median 45 days of COVID-19 infection and this was found to be significantly associated with immunosuppressive drug discontinuation. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age and gender indicated that smoking and using interferon-alpha decreased the likelihood of getting COVID-19. The incidence and severity of COVID-19 did not differ between those who were using colchicine or not. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in this prospectively followed cohort of BS patients was almost two folds of that estimated for the general population living in Istanbul, Turkey, however, the clinical outcome of COVID-19 was not severe and there was no mortality. The protective effect of smoking and interferon deserves further investigation. On the other hand, colchicine did not have any positive or negative effect against COVID-19. Significant number of patients flared after COVID-19, however, this was significantly associated with immunosuppressive discontinuation during the infection. Contrary to our previous observations, COVID-19 did not seem to exacerbate thrombotic events during or after the infection.

A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the fast-tracked vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has advanced the clinical translation pathway for nanomedicine drug delivery systems. The laboratory science of lipid-based nanoparticles was ready and rose to the clinical challenge of rapid vaccine development. The successful development and fast tracking of SARS-CoV-2 nanomedicine vaccines has exciting implications for the future of nanotechnology-enabled drug and gene delivery; it demonstrates that nanomedicine is necessary and critical to the successful delivery of advanced molecular therapeutics such as nucleic acids, it is establishing the precedent of safety and the population effect of phase four clinical trials, and it is laying the foundation for the clinical translation of more complex, non-lipid nanomedicines.

Clinical signs, virus replication and (histo)pathological changes in the lungs, percentage of neutrophils and bioactive TNF-alpha and IL-1 in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were examined. The effects of separate virus or LPS inoculations were subclinical and failed to induce high and sustained cytokine levels. In a preliminary study, pigs were inoculated with PRCV and then with LPS 24 h later and killed sequentially. Severe respiratory disease and significantly enhanced TNF-alpha titres (208-3601 U/ml versus 40-89 U/ml after LPS only) were seen during the first 12 h after LPS inoculation. IL-1 levels (106-1631 U/ml versus 28-654 U/ml after LPS only) were also increased, but persisted for longer after clinical recovery than TNF-alpha. In a second study, pigs were inoculated with PRCV and subsequently with LPS at various time intervals ranging from 0 to 24 h, and killed 5 h after inoculation with LPS. A time interval of at least 12 h between inoculations was necessary for prominent respiratory signs to develop. Production of TNF-alpha, but not IL-1, was also dependent on the time interval between inoculations and was tightly correlated with disease. Lung neutrophil infiltration and pathological changes were comparable after combined PRCV-LPS and single LPS inoculations, and were not associated with disease. These data show that exposure to high endotoxin concentrations in swine buildings can precipitate respiratory disease in PRCV-infected pigs, and that TNF-alpha is probably an important mediator of these effects.

These recombinant H1-H3 hemagglutinin ectodomain fusions could be transiently expressed at high yield in mammalian cell culture using Expi293F suspension cells. Fusions were trimeric, and as stable in solution as their individual trimeric counterparts.

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic.

This is the basic question discussed in this essay, within a philosophical/existential context. The central argument is that the concept of death is problematic and, following Levinas, the author holds that death cannot lead to nothingness. This accords with the teaching of all religious traditions, which hold that there is life beyond death, and Plato's and Aristotle's theories about the immortality of the soul. In modernity, since the Enlightenment, God and religion have been placed in the margin or rejected in rational discourse. Consequently, the anthropocentric promethean view of man has been stressed and the reality of the limits placed on humans by death deemphasised or ignored. Yet, death remains at the centre of nature and human life, and its reality and threat become evident in the spread of a single virus.

The Structural Equation Modeling method was applied to analyze the collected 1516 complete responses. The survey results and measurement equations confirmed the association between observed and corresponding latent variables. The results of SEM revealed that the travelers Awareness of Consequences (AC) and Ascription of Responsibility (AR) are positively correlated with Personal Norms (PN), whereas attitudes towards public transport are negatively related to the PN. The perceived behavioral control (PBC) and PN have negative structural correlations with public transport use. However, the attitudes towards public transport are strong predictors of travelers behavior towards public transport. The current motorcycle users and high-income people have low preferences, whereas current users of public transport modes and middle-income people have high preferences to choose public transport during a pandemic. The travelers perceived difficulty of complying with safety guidelines while traveling, such as wearing a facemask, use of sanitizers, and maintaining a social distance, have a significant impact on their public transport use.

Human bocavirus was detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and real-time PCR. Of the 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples, 104 (5.7%) were positive for hBoV; a similar prevalence was observed in all three periods studied. Among hBoV-infected children, 53.8% were between 1C2 years old, and hBoV was detected alone in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. All of the detected hBoV strains belonged to genotype 1. The median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples containing strains with both the N546H and T590S mutations compared to other samples (p<0.05). Children with a single hBoV-1 infection more frequently had upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than those who were co-infected (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization was longer among children with high viral loads than that observed among children with low viral loads (8.0 2.2 days vs 5.0 1.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and the use of aerosol therapy was more frequent among children with high viral loads than among those with low viral loads (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). This study shows that hBoV is a relatively uncommon but stable infectious agent in children and that hBoV1 seems to be the only strain detected in Italy in respiratory samples. From a clinical point of view, hBoV1 seems to have in the majority of healthy children relatively low clinical relevance.

METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out in electronic databases for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and experimental studies which investigated the efficacy and safety of CQ, HCQ with or without Azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Findings from the reviews were synthesised using tables and forest plots and the quality effect model was used for the updated meta-analysis. The main outcomes were mortality, the need for intensive care services, disease exacerbation, viral clearance and occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: Thirteen reviews with 40 primary studies were included. Two meta-analyses reported a high risk of mortality, with ORs of 2.2 and 3.0, and the two others found no association between HCQ and mortality. Findings from two meta-analyses showed that HCQ with Azithromycin increased the risk of mortality, with similar ORs of 2.5.

Social distancing has been and will be one of the most effective measures and sometimes, the only available one for fighting epidemics and saving lives. However, it has not been so clear how social distancing should be practiced or managed, especially when it comes to regulating everyones otherwise normal social activities. The debate on how to implement social distancing often leads to a heated political argument, while research on the subject is lacking. This paper is to provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of the scientific nature of social distancing by considering it as a social dilemma game played by every individual against his/her population. From this perspective, every individual needs to make a decision on how to engage in social distancing, or risk being trapped into a dilemma either exposing to deadly diseases or getting no access to necessary social activities. As the players of the game, the individuals decisions depend on the populations actions and vice versa, and an optimal strategy can be found when the game reaches an equilibrium. The paper shows how an optimal strategy can be determined for a population with either closely related or completely separated social activities and with either single or multiple social groups, and how the collective behaviors of social distancing can be simulated by following every individuals actions as the distancing game progresses. The simulation results for populations of varying sizes and complexities are presented, which not only justify the choices of the strategies based on the theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate the convergence of the individual actions to an optimal distancing strategy in silico and possibly in natura as well, if every individual makes rational distancing decisions.","output":"Social distancing is a social dilemma game played by every individual against his/her population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have focused on how different school ground environments can stimulate physical activity (PA) in children.

This study described two school ground environments that provided large and multifunctional spaces, giving the children several affordances for being physically active during the school day. The constructed schoolyard afforded a space of 44 m(2) per child and had an access to sports and game courts and various types of equipment for PA.

Characteristics of commonly used knots have not been studied. OBJECTIVES To compare the modified transfixing and giant knots and the emasculator in open and closed equine castration techniques. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo experiment. METHODS A total of 144 testicles were randomly assigned to 2 groups for open or closed castration. Both groups were divided into 3 subgroups of 18 specimens each: emasculator only, emasculator plus giant knot and emasculator plus transfixing knot and the open castration group also contained 2 further subgroups of 18 testicles each: giant knot only and transfixing knot only. The length of suture material used was measured for each knot and the leaking pressure of the testicular artery measured using dye injection. In the closed castration group, parietal tunic tensile strength was measured with a tensiometer. RESULTS Leaking pressure was higher in open compared with closed castration, with no significant difference among subgroups. In the closed castration group, minimum leaking pressure for the emasculator plus transfixing knot and emasculator only subgroups were close to standard physiological arterial pressures. The giant knot required less suture material than the transfixing knot. Parietal tunic tensile strength was higher when ligatures were applied. CONCLUSIONS The giant and transfixing knot techniques have comparable haemostatic capability and parietal tunic tensile strength, but the giant knot requires less suture material. In open castration, using the emasculator alone may produce adequate haemostasis. In closed castration, using the giant knot in combination with the emasculator increases the bursting pressure and possibly reduces the incidence of haemorrhage. In closed castration, application of a ligature may reduce the risk of evisceration.","output":"Ex vivo comparison of the giant and transfixing knot in equine open and closed castration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and AimsThe outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect the disease status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. MethodsA questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. ResultsA total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohns disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ[a?]50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009). ConclusionsThe outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. The patients disease condition could be assessed by our questionnaires.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged 18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). FINDINGS: We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 59 months (IQR 49C65) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40C59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity. INTERPRETATION: We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

In the field of language teacher education, this line of research has been evolving, with the recent trend being streamlined into teacher cognition as a generic or umbrella term. Despite increasing amounts of research output so far, research into foreign language teachers cognitions about their own teaching and decision-making is still insufficient, particularly with regard to university-level English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in China. Drawing on Vygotskys Sociocultural Theory, this qualitative research focused on EFL teachers cognitions about form-focused instruction in Chinese university settings. It intended to discover how teachers cognitions changed when they were expected to teach in actual classrooms and what factors contributed to these changes. Data collected from four teacher-participants through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and follow-up stimulated recall interviews showed participants support for focus-on-form instruction, which means they not only paid attention to the grammatical form of the language but also to the meaning it is intended to convey. However, data also showed that the teacher-participants shifted from focus-on-form to focus-on-formS instruction in actual teaching, which suggests that they might have realized the challenges of carrying out teaching activities surrounding focus-on-form and would like to take an easier approach by only teaching the grammar of the language by focusing on formS. Such incongruences are interpreted with reference to a plethora of sociocultural factors including traditional Chinese thinking and institutional expectations. The implications of the findings for stakeholders in universities, including faculty members, students, and curriculum developers in similar contexts, are also discussed.","output":"A Sociocultural Perspective on English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) Teachers Cognitions About Form-Focused Instruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 M, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 M, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 M), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 M at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) self-care interventions offer the best solution for improving access to quality healthcare services with efficiency and economy. This manuscript documents country experience in introducing and scaling up two selected SRHR self-care interventions. A prospective qualitative study design was used and a semi-structured questionnaire was shared with identified SRHR private sector partners selected through convenience and purposive sampling. The two interventions include the use of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage and the use of subcutaneous depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) as injectable contraceptive method. Data collection was done through emails and telephone follow-up calls. RESULTS: Nine of the 13 partners consulted for the study responded. The two selected self-care interventions are mainly supported by private sector partners (national and international nongovernmental organizations) having national or subnational existence. Their mandates include all relevant areas, such as policy advocacy, field implementation, trainings, supervision and monitoring. A majority of partners reported experience related to the use of misoprostol; it was introduced more than a decade ago, is registered and is procured by both public and private sectors. Subcutaneous DMPA is a new intervention, having been introduced only recently, and commodity availability remains a challenge. It is being delivered through health workers/providers and is not promoted as a self-administered contraceptive. Community engagement and awareness raising is reported as an essential element of successful field implementation; however, no beneficiary data was collected for the study. Training approaches differ considerably, are standalone or integrated with SRHR topics and their duration varies between 1 and 5 days, covering a range of cadres. CONCLUSION: Pubic sector ownership and patronage is essential for introducing and scaling up self-care interventions as a measure to support the healthcare system in delivering quality sexual and reproductive health services. Supervision, monitoring and reporting are areas requiring further support, as well as the leadership and governance role of the public sector. Standardization of trainings, community awareness, supervision, monitoring and reporting are required together with integration of self-care in routine capacity building activities (pre- and in-service) on sexual and reproductive health in the country.","output":"The role of partners in promoting self-care for misoprostol and subcutaneous DMPA in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines can help end the pandemic, but with dangerous variants and limited supplies, how do you protect people fairly?

Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycations effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester- and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. METHODS. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing -galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and cross-linked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. RESULTS. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40- to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of >700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in >95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times m ore efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. CONCLUSIONS. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide- and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.","output":"Cross-linked Small Polyethylenimines: While Still Nontoxic, Deliver DNA Efficiently to Mammalian Cells in Vitro and in Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the recent issue,1 which raised the concern about the co-circulation of dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A pooled analysis was performed of data from five published studies. The primary outcome was tolerability as evaluated by the severity of hyperemia. The secondary objectives were patient tolerance based on a composite ocular surface disease (OSD) score arising from ocular signs and symptoms, patient and investigator satisfaction, and a comparison of IOP-lowering efficacy. RESULTS: There were three randomized controlled trials and two observational studies included in the analysis. Conjunctival hyperemia improved significantly in 25.6% (388) of patients switched to the PFL group versus 11.7% (117) of patients switched to the PCL group (p < 0.001). PFL was two times superior to PCL in reducing ocular hyperemia (odds ratio = 1.96; p < 0.001). The mean OSD composite score decreased by 32.2% in patients switched to the PFL group and 14.1% in the PCL group (p < 0.001). At 3 months, the mean IOP was similar between groups (p = 0.312). CONCLUSION: This post hoc pooled analysis confirmed the findings of the individual studies that PFL is as efficacious at reducing IOP as PCL but better tolerated. After switching to PFL, there was twice the improvement in the OSD composite score. PFL was twice as effective at reducing ocular hyperemia and other ocular signs.

Additionally, 226 surface swab samples were collected from medical instrument surfaces and the surrounding areas before and after ambulance runs. Groups or genus of isolated bacteria and fungi were preliminarily identified by Gram's stain and lactophenol cotton blue. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient with a p-value of less than 0.050 considered significant. RESULTS The mean and standard deviation of bacterial and fungal counts at the start of ambulance runs were 318485cfu/m(3) and 522581cfu/m(3), respectively. Bacterial counts during patient services were 468607cfu/m(3) and fungal counts were 656612cfu/m(3). Mean bacterial and fungal counts during patient services were significantly higher than those at the start of ambulance runs, p=0.005 and p=0.030, respectively. For surface contamination, the overall bacterial counts before and after patient services were 0.80.7cfu/cm(2) and 1.31.1cfu/cm(2), respectively (p<0.001).

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN The data of 212 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively analyzed. Computed tomography (CT)-obtained DT was measured in cross-sectional images of the mediastinal window at the level of the outlet of the celiac trunk at admission and at 2 weeks, then the rate of change in DT(RCDT) at 2 weeks was calculated. Nutritional risk and malnutrition were evaluated at admission. RESULTS A total of 91 patients were involved in the study. The mean DT was 3.060.58 mm (3.150.63 mm in male and 2.930.50 mm in female). DT was significantly negatively correlated with malnutrition based on Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria (r=-0.324, p=0.002), Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score (r=-0.364, p=0.000) and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score (r=-0.326, p=0.002) at admission. For the prediction of LOS 4 weeks in patients with COVID-19, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the RCDT at 2 weeks was 0.772, while the AUCs of DT, NRS-2002, MUST and Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill scores at admission were 0.751, 0.676, 0.638 and 0.699 respectively. According to the model of multiple linear regression analysis, the DT at admission (=-0.377, p=0.000), RCDT at 2 weeks ( =-0.323, p=0.001), and mechanical ventilation (=0.192, p=0.031) were independent risk factors contributed to LOS.

With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host.

The fate of SUSD2+ eMSC during pregnancy and their role in decidualization is not fully known. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of progesterone on the stemness of the SUSD2+ eMSC isolated from non-pregnant uterine samples. Secondary objectives were to characterize the functional capacity including differentiation and clonogenicity assays of SUSD2+ eMSC isolated from decidua at full term and compare it to the capacity of those isolated from non-pregnant uterine samples. Progesterone treatment induced changes in the decidual gene expression profile in non-pregnant SUSD2+ eMSC. Data analysis of a publicly available single cell RNA-seq data set revealed differential expression of several mesenchymal and epithelial signature genes between the SUSD2+ eMSC and the decidual stromal cells, suggesting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition occurs during decidualization. Histological analysis revealed a significantly lower abundance of SUSD2+ eMSC in 1st trimester and full term samples compared to non-pregnant samples, p = 0.0296 and 0.005, respectively. The differentiation and the colony forming capacity did not differ significantly between the cells isolated from non-pregnant and pregnant uterine samples. Our results suggest that SUSD2+ eMSC undergo decidualization in vitro, while maintaining MSC plasma membrane phenotype.

The risk of restarting activities is unknown. OBJECTIVE: assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, both to patients and healthcare workers, in relation to esophageal and anorectal functional tests during the pandemic without protective measures. METHOD: a questionnaire was designed to determine whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed by either a test or compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. RESULTS: the survey was answered by 263 (92.9 %) patients. Four (1.52 %) patients had confirmed COVID-19 in the two weeks after the functional test (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 [95 % CI -0.06-16.74], OR 0.84 [95 % CI: 0.83-0.85], p < 0.001) and no patient after anorectal manometry. Another five had only compatible symptoms, for a total of nine patients (3.42 %) (adjusted rate 27.50 cases/1,000 [95 % CI: 7.27-47.74], OR 2.84 [95 % CI: 2.81-2.87]). In the total study period, 18.25 % had confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms. The average number of days between the procedure and the first day of symptoms was progressively shortened (January: 56 days, February: 33 days, March: 10.5 days). Two of ten healthcare workers (20 %) had confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: the risk of COVID-19 infection when performing functional tests is low and more related to the evolution of the pandemic rather than to the procedure itself.

The heterogeneous nature of asthma may be attributed to a complex interplay between risk factors (either intrinsic or extrinsic) and specific pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and even bacteria. The intrinsic risk factors are highly correlated with asthma exacerbation in host, which may be mediated via genetic polymorphisms, enhanced airway epithelial lysis, apoptosis, and exaggerated viral replication in infected cells, resulting in reduced innate immune response and concomitant reduction of interferon (types I, II, and III) synthesis. The canonical features of allergic asthma include strong Th2-related inflammation, sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), eosinophilia, enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines, goblet cell hyperplasia, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway remodeling. However, the NSAID-resistant non-Th2 asthma shows a characteristic neutrophilic influx, Th1/Th17 or even mixed (Th17-Th2) immune response and concurrent cytokine streams. Moreover, inhaled corticosteroid-resistant asthma may be associated with multifactorial innate and adaptive responses.

The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing. This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003. It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial. Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency. Key Points ? In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. ? Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. ? Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two patients with MS and 32 controls were included in the study. Bilateral C5, C6, and C7 mean nerve root diameters, and mean elasticity values in kiloPascal (kPa) were measured in the patient and control groups. The relationship between the age, height, and weight values and nerve diameter-elasticity values of the patient and control groups was compared. RESULTS The elasticity values of the C5 and C6 nerve roots were increased, and the nerve root thickness was decreased in the MS group compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the C7 mean nerve root elasticity (kPa) and diameter measurements in the patient and control groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Our study showed an increase in the BP nerve root elasticity values (kPa) in patients with MS compared to that of the control group and a decrease in diameter values thought to be related to the possible chronic atrophic process.

Methods: A cohort of 55 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was prospectively recruited - blood sampling was performed at baseline, post-treatment and hospital discharge. Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory investigations were compared between treatment groups and across timepoints. Acute serum IL-6 and CRP levels were then compared to those with suspected COVID-19 (SCOVID) and age and sex matched patients with SAB and patients hospitalized for any non-infectious condition (NIC). Results: IL-6 was elevated at admission in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort but at lower levels compared to matched SAB patients. Median (IQR) IL-6 at admission was 73.89 pg/mL (30.9, 126.39) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to 92.76 pg/mL (21.75, 246.55) in SAB (p=0.017); 12.50 pg/mL (3.06, 35.77) in patients with NIC; and 95.51 pg/mL (52.17, 756.67) in SCOVID. Median IL-6 and CRP levels decreased between admission and discharge timepoints. This reduction was amplified in patients treated with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. CRP and bedside vital signs were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 severity. Conclusions: Knowledge of the kinetics of IL-6 did not offer enhanced predictive value for disease severity in COVID-19 over common investigations such as CRP and vital signs.","output":"The Role of Immunological and Clinical Biomarkers to Predict Clinical COVID-19 Severity and Response to Therapy-A Prospective Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have suggested that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may be associated with higher risks of tuberculosis and pneumonia in patients with COPD. However, it is not known whether ICS increases the risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Aim of this study was to explore the relationship between ICS and URTI. Through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception to March 2016, we identified randomized controlled trials of ICS therapy lasting at least 6 months. A meta-analysis by the Peto approach was also conducted to generate summary estimates comparing ICS with non-ICS treatment on the risk of URTI. A total of 14 studies involving 19,777 subjects were considered in the meta-analysis. Compared with non-ICS treatment, ICS were associated with a significantly increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.29; I2 = 9%; p = .004). Subgroup analyzes were performed for different dose, high-dose ICS was associated with a significantly increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05-1.34; I2 = 0%; p = .005), whereas low-dose ICS showed a non-significant increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.91-1.33; I2 = 0%; p = .32). Moreover, fluticasone was observed with an increased risk of URTI but not mometasone; high-dose fluticasone treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of URTI but not low-dose.

This study aims to provide the current data to allow adequate consent regarding the risks of post-surgery COVID-19 infection and subsequent COVID-19-related mortality. Methods: All orthopaedic trauma cases at the Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust from 'lockdown' (23 March 2020) to date (15 June 2020) were collated and split into three groups. Adult ambulatory trauma surgeries (upper limb trauma, ankle fracture, tibial plateau fracture) and regional-specific referrals (periprosthetic hip fracture) were performed at a stand-alone elective site that accepted COVID-19-negative patients. Neck of femur fractures (NOFF) and all remaining non-NOFF (paediatric trauma, long bone injury) surgeries were performed at an acute site hospital (mixed green/blue site). Patients were swabbed for COVID-19 before surgery on both sites. Age, sex, nature of surgery, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, associated comorbidity, length of stay, development of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, and post-surgical COVID-19-related deaths were collected. Results: At the elective site, 225 patients underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery; two became COVID-19-positive (0.9%) in the immediate perioperative period, neither of which was fatal. At the acute site, 93 patients underwent non-NOFF trauma surgery, of whom six became COVID-19-positive (6.5%) and three died. A further 84 patients underwent NOFF surgery, seven becoming COVID-19 positive (8.3%) and five died. Conclusion: At the elective site, the rate of COVID-19 infection following orthopaedic trauma surgery was low, at 0.9%. At the acute mixed site (typical district general hospital), for non-NOFF surgery there was a 6.5% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection (seven-fold higher risk) with 50% COVID-19 mortality; for NOFF surgery, there was an 8.3% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, with 71% COVID-19 mortality.

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on emergency department (ED) presentations and admissions. DESIGN: We analysed ED presentations and admissions from a 5-year period (April 2016-February 2021). An interrupted time series analysis was used to estimate the presentations and admissions that would have been seen in year 5 without the pandemic using the data from years 1 to 4. These estimations were used to calculate the difference between the expected and the observed presentations and admissions during the pandemic year. RESULTS: There were 166 459 presentations over 5 years. There was a 38.1% (95% CI 33.9% to 42.3%) reduction in presentations during the pandemic with no variation by sex, age, deprivation or ethnicity. Largest reductions were associated with children being home schooled rather than with lockdowns. For admissions, there was a 23.4% (17.4% to 29.4%) reduction, less for 5-17 year age group. Infection and asthma/wheeze presentations reduced by around 60% with smaller reductions for mental health and trauma. There was no change for surgical presentations, burns/scolds or allergic reactions. There was an increase in females aged 11-17 years presenting with mental health issues during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, there was a substantial reduction in both ED presentations and admissions. The differential impact on specific presentations suggests this was due to the impact of social distancing and reduced social mixing rather than widening of health inequality or increased barriers to care.

A popular model for such data is the Hurdle model, which explicitly models the probability of a zero count, while assuming a sampling distribution on the positive integers. We consider data from multiple count processes. In this context, it is of interest to study the patterns of counts and cluster the subjects accordingly. We introduce a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to cluster multiple, possibly related, zero-inflated processes. We propose a joint model for zero-inflated counts, specifying a Hurdle model for each process with a shifted Negative Binomial sampling distribution. Conditionally on the model parameters, the different processes are assumed independent, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of parameters as compared to traditional multivariate approaches. The subject-specific probabilities of zero-inflation and the parameters of the sampling distribution are flexibly modelled via an enriched finite mixture with random number of components. This induces a two-level clustering of the subjects based on the zero/non-zero patterns (outer clustering) and on the sampling distribution (inner clustering). Posterior inference is performed through tailored MCMC schemes.

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC were included during stable and/or progressive disease. The initial activating EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations) at stable disease and at progressive disease (together with T790M) were assessed in simultaneously collected plasma and sputum samples and detected by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). RESULTS: Activating EGFR mutations were detected in 47% of the plasma samples and 41% of sputum samples during stable disease, and in 57% of plasma samples and 64% of sputum samples during progressive disease. T790M was detected in 44% of the plasma samples and 66% of the sputum samples at progressive disease. In ddPCR T790M-negative results for both specimens (plasma and sputum), negativity was confirmed by rebiopsy in 5 samples. Concordance rate of plasma and sputum for T790M was 0.86, with a positive percent agreement of 1.0 and a negative percent agreement of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that EGFR mutation analysis with ddPCR is feasible in sputum samples.

Aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis are the most important infections reported in patients with hematologic malignancies that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These infections are caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens that do not cause severe issues in healthy individuals, but in patients with hematologic malignancies lead to disseminated infection with different clinical manifestations. Prophylaxis and creating a safe environment with proper filters and air pressure for patients to avoid contact with the pathogens in the surrounding environment can prevent IFI. Furthermore, due to the absence of specific symptoms in IFI, rapid and accurate diagnosis reduces the mortality rate of these infections and using molecular techniques along with standard mycological methods will improve the diagnosis of disseminated fungal infection in patients with hematologic disorders.

Attracted by its fast-developing economy, the population of Shenzhen has reached 14 million and has become one of the top five largest cities by population size in China. The incidence of pertussis here was about 2.02/100,000, far exceeding that of the whole province and the whole country (both < 1/100,000). There are increasing numbers of reports demonstrating variation in Bordetella pertussis antigens and genes, which may be associated with the increased incidence. Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 387 suspected cases were collected in Shenzhen in 2018 for genotypic and molecular epidemiological analysis. METHODS There were 387 suspected cases of pertussis enrolled at surveillance sites in Shenzhen from June to August 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected pertussis cases were collected for bacterial culture and the identity of putative Bordetella pertussis isolates was confirmed by real-time PCR. The immunization history of each patient was taken. The acellular pertussis vaccine (APV) antigen genes for pertussis toxin (ptxA, ptxC), pertactin (prn) and fimbriae (fim2 and fim3) together with the pertussis toxin promoter region (ptxP) were analyzed by second-generation sequencing. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences publicly available from GenBank, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ). The antimicrobial susceptibility was test by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. RESULTS Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis were successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 387 suspected cases, with a positivity rate of 16.79%, including 28 males and 22 females, accounting for 56.0% and 44.0% respectively. Thirty-eight of the 50 (76%) patients were found to be positive for B. pertussis by culture. Among the positive cases with a history of vaccination, 30 of 42 (71.4%) cases had an incomplete pertussis vaccination history according to the national recommendation. Three phylogenetic groups (PG1-PG3) were identified each containing a predominant genotype. The two vaccines strains, CS and Tohama I, were distantly related to these three groups. Thirty-one out of fifty (62%) isolates belonged to genotype PG1, with the allelic profile prn2/ptxC2/ptxP3/ptxA1/fim3-1/fim2-1. Eighteen out of fifty (36%) isolates contained the A2047G mutation and were highly resistant to erythromycin, and all belonged to genotype PG3 (prn1/ptxA1/ptxP1/ptxC1/fim3-1/fim2-1), which is closely related to the recent epidemic strains found in northern China. CONCLUSIONS The positive rate of cases under one-year-old was significantly higher than that of other age groups and should be monitored. The dominant antigen genotypes of 50 Shenzhen isolates are closely related to the epidemic strains in the United States, Australia and many countries in Europe. Despite high rates of immunization with APV, epidemics of pertussis have recently occurred in these countries. Therefore, genomic analysis of circulating isolates of B. pertussis should be continued, for it will benefit the control of whooping cough and development of improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies.","output":"Molecular epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis and analysis of vaccine antigen genes from clinical isolates from Shenzhen, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to characterize the bacterial community and functional diversity in co-composting microcosms of crude oil waste sludge amended with different animal manures, and to evaluate the scope for biostimulation based in situ bioremediation.

Given the important role of obesity in the increased risk of heart failure, especially that with preserved systolic function and the recent rises in COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality, this review should provide compelling evidence for the presence of obesity cardiomyopathy, independent of various comorbid conditions, underlying mechanisms, and offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches (pharmacological and lifestyle modification) for the clinical management of obesity cardiomyopathy.","output":"Obesity cardiomyopathy: evidence, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68-46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F(1,1103)=423.83, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses' QOL, a heightened awareness of, and early treatment for depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.","output":"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead to large transmission clusters. Characterizing the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk. As data from detailed contact-tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we developed an R package called o2geosocial to reconstruct the transmission clusters and the importation status of the cases from their age, location, genotype and onset date. We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the USA between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model. Spatial heterogeneity in vaccine coverage is difficult to measure directly. Our approach was able to highlight areas with potential for local transmission using a minimal number of variables and could be applied to assess the intensity of ongoing transmission in a region.","output":"Probabilistic reconstruction of measles transmission clusters from routinely collected surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) is a type of oxygen therapy that provides humidified and heated oxygen through a nasal cannula at much higher flow rates than standard oxygen therapy, while also allowing control over the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2).

The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","output":"Small Resistance Artery Disease and ACE2 in Hypertension: A New Paradigm in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of control algorithms oriented to robotic assistance and rehabilitation tasks for people with motor disabilities has been of increasing interest in recent years.

We studied the effect of the lockdown on mental health care utilisation rates in private-sector care in South Africa. MethodsWe did an interrupted time series analysis using insurance claims from January 1, 2017, to June 1, 2020 of beneficiaries 18 years or older from a large private sector medical aid scheme. We calculated weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates for organic mental disorders, substance use disorders, serious mental disorders, depression, anxiety, other mental disorders, any mental disorder, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the effect of the lockdown on weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates and the weekly change in rates during the lockdown until June 1, 2020. Results710,367 persons were followed up for a median of 153 weeks. Hospital admission rates (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.44) and outpatient consultation rates (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63-0.87) for any mental disorder decreased substantially after the lockdown and did not recover to pre-lockdown levels until June 1, 2020. Health care utilisation rates for alcohol withdrawal syndrome doubled after the introduction of the lockdown, but the statistical uncertainty around the estimates was large (OR 2.24; 95% CI 0.69-7.24). ConclusionsReduced mental health care contact rates during the COVID-19 lockdown likely reflect a substantial unmet need for mental health services with potential long-term consequences for mental health patients and their families.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, containment measures such as shelter-in-place, lockdown, social distancing, and self-quarantine have severely impacted the foundation of human society, resulting in a drastic change in our everyday experience. In this paper, the relationships between musical behavior, lifestyle, and psychological states during the shelter-in-place period of the COVID-19 pandemic are investigated. An online survey on musical experience, lifestyle changes, stress level, musical behaviors, media usage, and environmental sound perception was conducted. The survey was conducted in early June 2020. Responses from 620 people in 24 countries were collected, with the large proportion of the responses coming from the U.S. (55.5%) and India (21.4%). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed causal relationships between lifestyle, stress, and music behaviors. Elements such as stress-level change, work risk, and staying home contribute to changes in musical experiences, such as moderating emotion with music, feeling emotional with music, and being more attentive to music. Stress-level change was correlated with work risk and income change, and people who started living with others due to the outbreak, especially with their children, indicated less change in stress level. People with more stress-level change tended to use music more purposefully for their mental well-being, such as to moderate emotions, to influence mood, and to relax. In addition, people with more stress-level change tend to be more annoyed by neighbors' noise. Housing type was not directly associated with annoyance; however, attention to environmental sounds decreased when the housing type was smaller. Attention to environmental and musical sounds and the emotional responses to them are highly inter-correlated. Multi-group SEM based on musicians showed that the causal relationship structure for professional musicians differs from that of less-experienced musicians. For professional musicians, staying at home was the only component that caused all musical behavior changes; stress did not cause musical behavior changes. Regarding Internet use, listening to music via YouTube and streaming was preferred over TV and radio, especially among less-experienced musicians, while participation in the online music community was preferred by more advanced musicians. This work suggests that social, environmental, and personal factors and limitations influence the changes in our musical behavior, perception of sonic experience, and emotional recognition, and that people actively accommodated the unusual pandemic situations using music and Internet technologies.","output":"Music in Quarantine: Connections Between Changes in Lifestyle, Psychological States, and Musical Behaviors During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Greece, there are many audiovisual resources available on the Internet that interest scientists and the general public.

The Pub and the People is a classic text for its distinctly sociological approach, seeing patterns of drinking and socialising in context rather than focusing primarily on pathological consequences. The main conclusions were that the pub is a living social organism and that the traditional approach of British sociology, which, MO argued, focused on 'the drink problem' and the links between alcohol, crime and delinquency, failed to take account of the full social context. Mass Observation's focus on the pub as a place anticipates themes taken up in work on alcohol in cultural geography. Later alcohol researchers and epidemiologists have continued this orientation, recognising the importance of physical and social environments in relation to alcohol consumption. Other studies have built on the MO initiative by looking at how drug and alcohol consumption links to identity, friendship and sociality or at the connections between intoxication and pleasure.

To investigate the transcriptional control of the porcine arterivirus, a recombinant PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pCPV expressing the capsid gene of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) between PRRSV ORF1b and ORF2a was developed. The rescued recombinant viruses contained a range of disparate deletions of the inserted PCV2 sequence, yet two stable recombinant viruses containing 41 and 275 nt of foreign sequences were generated upon plaque purification and serial passages. Further analysis of the sg RNA2 profile revealed that an array of novel sg RNA species was generated in cells infected with the recombinant virus. One group was formed by utilizing the inserted PCV2 sequence as TRS; another group was generated from cryptic TRS-like PRRSV sequences located 19, 37 and 97 nt immediately downstream of the PRRSV ORF2 AUG. These results demonstrated that (1) the recombinant virus from direct insertion of foreign sequences was genetically unstable, while two recombinant PRRSVs containing foreign sequence of 41 or 275 nt in length, respectively, became stable upon plaque purification and further serial passages; (2) PRRSV can utilize foreign TRS-like sequence as transcriptional promoter; (3) the insertion of foreign sequence provoked the generation of novel subgenomic RNAs utilizing cryptic TRS-like sequences that remain non-functional in native PRRSV.","output":"Recombinant PRRSV expressing porcine circovirus sequence reveals novel aspect of transcriptional control of porcine arterivirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective adoption of online platforms for teaching, learning, and skill development is essential to both academic institutions and workplaces.

At Belfast Health and Social Care Trust it has not been possible to manage all eligible patients surgically on their index admission within the allotted resources. In addition, the route to outpatient cholecystectomy was ineffective introducing multiple delays for patients. This project aimed to identify the sources of delay and streamline the pathway. Methods: Using quality improvement methodology 927 consecutive admissions with acute biliary pathology were followed over 16 months and analysed fully mapping the existing pathways, identifying key interfaces and delays on the patients journey to surgery. Results: Several barriers were identified including unnecessary clinic visits, redundant pre-assessment of fit patients and missed opportunities to provide procedure information or obtain consent. Collaboration with the anaesthetic team led to development of a pre-assessment screening questionnaire which was included in a resource pack introduced for biliary admissions. This also contained a decision-making tool / pathway flowchart, information leaflets, consent and haemovigilence forms.

Daily intake of calcitriol before the onset of clinical manifestations can prevent them in affected children. METHODS: A genetic screening test was developed and validated for the CYP27B1 gene c.262del pathogenic variant. Newborn screening was implemented in the SLSJ region for this variant, and the feasibility and acceptability were assessed. Sixteen medical records of children affected with VDDR1A were reviewed to document the consequences of the disease at diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 2000 newborns were tested for VDDR1A. Most families (96.5%) accepted the genetic test. We found a carrier rate of 1/29 for the c.262delG variant in our cohort, which is suggestive of a founder effect. We identified one child affected with VDDR1A and treatment was initiated before the onset of clinical manifestations. On average, children with VDDR1A were diagnosed at 13.8  5 months of age, they had a significant failure to thrive at diagnosis, among other harmful health consequences. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that in our population, the newborn genetic screening program is safe and feasible, it has high acceptability, and it is efficient to identify affected children.

Longhaul COVID-19 is the current name being given to the long-term sequelae (symptoms lasting beyond 6 weeks) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multiple case definitions for ME/CFS exist, but post-exertional malaise (PEM) is currently emerging as the hallmark symptom. The inability to identify a unique trigger of ME/CFS, as well as the inability to identify a specific, diagnostic laboratory test, led many physicians to conclude that the illness was psychosomatic or non-existent. However, recent research in the US and the UK, championed by patient organizations and their use of the internet and social media, suggest underlying pathophysiologies, e.g., oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The similarity and overlap of ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 symptoms suggest to us similar pathological processes. We put forward a unifying hypothesis that explains the precipitating events such as viral triggers and other documented exposures: For their overlap in symptoms, ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 should be described as Post Active Phase of Infection Syndromes (PAPIS). We further propose that the underlying biochemical pathways and pathophysiological processes of similar symptoms are similar regardless of the initiating trigger. Exploration of the biochemical pathways and pathophysiological processes should yield effective therapies for these conditions and others that may exhibit these symptoms. ME/CFS patients have suffered far too long. Longhaul COVD-19 patients should not be subject to a similar fate. We caution that failure to meet the now combined challenges of ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 will impose serious socioeconomic as well as clinical consequences for patients, the families of patients, and society as a whole.","output":"Our Evolving Understanding of ME/CFS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dr Hamdi Aziz Pasha, started autonomous bacteriology studies in the Medical School and worked as a bacteriology lecturer for many years He also chaired the health committee during the cholera epidemic which prevailed in the Aleppo Province, the Sanjak of Zor and Iraq between the years 1902-1904 He collected his findings during this assignment into a book titled \\"Suriye Kttastyla Zor Sancagt ye Hitta-t Irakiye'de Kolera istilatt, 1318-1320\\" (Cholera Epidemic in Syrian Region, the Sanjak of Zor and Iraq, 1318-132) This work, which is one of the significant resources of our study, contains the damage of cholera in Iraq, its spreading routes and measures required to be taken against cholera This work, written 115 years ago, also shows past examples of some mistakes nowadays The article's findings guide the protection of Public Health for the administrators of the period Besides, these findings will contribute to today's administrators who have faced similar situations in the days when we are fighting the Covid-19 outbreak The purpose of our study is to provide information about the life, services and works of Dr Hamdi Aziz Pasha and to reveal his findings on the cholera epidemic which prevailed in Iraq regions between the years 1902-1904 Essential resources of our study are the documents we have obtained from various classifications of the Ottoman Empire and the aforementioned book of Dr Hamdi Aziz Pasha In addition, some research works related to our subject was also used","output":"Pioneer of Bacteriology Education in the Ottoman Empire Hamdi Aziz Pasha and His Findings on 1902-1904 Iraq Cholera Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter lays the foundation for the book by situating it within the subfield of the sociolinguistics of tourism. In this chapter I am concerned with various complex processes pertaining to tourism and of adventure tourism in particular. First, I am concerned with the circulation of people as both tourists and transnational migrant workers in two global adventure meccas since these two distinct groups of people are currently considered to be the largest groups traversing the world to date, but for very different socioeconomic and political reasons. Second, I am interested in the ways in which places are experienced, performed and sold, and thus adopt a performative approach to place in my discussion of place-making practices. Third, I am interested in the semiotic industry of tourism and the commodification of adventure both online and offline, where thrill, risk and safety of embodied challenges are bottled up, packaged and sold linguistically, visually and thus semiotically, where individuals identities and bodies are reassessed and imbued with cultural, social and network capital. Fourth, I am interested in current theories of mobility that epistemologically question the boundaries and breakdown between labor, migration and leisure happening in contemporary times where the circulation of individuals, material and symbolic resources are taking place at rapid speeds. This discussion centers around places of play where a kind of post-precariat workforce has emerged as a result of distinct labor and immigration policies that have been created in order to both facilitate and block movement of people between certain nation-states in order to remain competitive within the global new economy. How mobility is theoretically being accounted for and empirically captured in postmodern times does not only pertain to the participants of this study and my discussion of adventure tourism hubs, but also to me as a researcher and the methodological approach taken in this study, which is one of a global, multi-sited and mobile ethnography. Engaging in this type of method means that the research being carried out is inevitably epistemologically linked with mobility, and contributes to the existing literature on the sociolinguistics of tourism.","output":"Theorizing Mobility, Place and Adventure Tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has impacted essentially every country's healthcare system in extraordinary ways, fundamentally changing the way we deliver care.

This recommendation has become more crucial with the current health crisis and the worldwide spread of COVID-19 pandemic. However, most face touches are done unconsciously, that is why it is difficult for people to monitor their hand moves and try to avoid touching the face all the time. Hand-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are equipped with multiple sensors that can be utilized to track hand moves automatically. This work proposes a smartwatch application that uses small, efficient, and end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to classify hand motion and identify Face-Touch moves. To train the models, a large dataset is collected for both left and right hands with over 28k training samples that represents multiple hand motion types, body positions, and hand orientations. The app provides real-time feedback and alerts the user with vibration and sound whenever attempting to touch the face. Achieved results show state of the art face-touch accuracy with average recall, precision, and F1-Score of 96.75%, 95.1%, 95.85% respectively, with low False Positives Rate (FPR) as 0.04%.

Prior studies have reported on outcomes of sporadic ampullary lesions, and only small cohort studies have reported outcomes associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome. AIMS We performed a systematic review with pooled analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of EP for treating ampullary adenomas in FAP. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search of major databases from inception to May 2020. Studies that included patients with endoscopically resected ampullary lesions and FAP were eligible. The rate of technical success, en bloc resection, piecemeal resection, recurrence, and adverse events was pooled by means of a random-effects model to obtain a proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Six studies, including a total of 99 patients, were included in our final analysis. Patient age ranged from 28 to 91 years. Pooled technical success was 90.3% (CI 76.9-96.3%, I2 = 31%). Rate of en bloc resection was 60.6% (CI 47.9-72.0%, I2 = 0%). Recurrence rate was 25.4% (5.7-65.9%, I2 = 82%). The post-procedural pancreatitis rate was 14.7% of which 68% (51 of 75) utilized prophylactic pancreatic stenting. Other adverse events included bleeding (9.2%) and perforation (4%).

This can be overwhelming in the beginning, mentally taxing, and induce errors into the resulting annotations;especially in citizen science or crowd sourcing scenarios where domain expertise is not required and only annotation guidelines are provided. To alleviate these issues, we propose annotation curricula, a novel approach to implicitly train annotators. Our goal is to gradually introduce annotators into the task by ordering instances that are annotated according to a learning curriculum. To do so, we first formalize annotation curricula for sentence- and paragraph-level annotation tasks, define an ordering strategy, and identify well-performing heuristics and interactively trained models on three existing English datasets. We then conduct a user study with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results show that using a simple heuristic to order instances can already significantly reduce the total annotation time while preserving a high annotation quality. Annotation curricula thus can provide a novel way to improve data collection.

METHODS: We undertook a quasi-experimental study reporting on a 5-month implementation period in 58 primary health care centres from municipal areas within Bogot (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru). Within the municipal areas, units were randomized to four arms: (1) care as usual (control); (2) training alone; (3) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a less intensive clinical and training package; and (4) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a more intense clinical and training package. The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of consulting adult patients out of the population registered within the centre whose alcohol consumption was measured (coverage). RESULTS: The combination of municipal support and training did not result in higher coverage than training alone (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.8). Training alone resulted in higher coverage than no training (IRR = 9.8, 95% CI = 4.1 to 24.7). Coverage did not differ by intensity of the clinical and training package (coefficient = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Training of providers is key to increasing coverage of alcohol measurement amongst primary health care patients.

Here, we aim to investigate the association between poverty level, as an indicator of SES, and COVID-19 related clinical outcomes including hospitalization and all-cause mortality. This retrospective cohort study included 3528 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 seen at a large New York City health system between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Data for neighborhood level poverty was acquired from the American Community Survey 2014C2018 and defined as the percent of residents in each ZIP code whose household income was below the federal poverty threshold (FPT): 0% to < 20% below FPT (low poverty) and > 20% below FPT (high poverty). COVID-19 positive patients who resided in high poverty areas were significantly younger, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities and were more likely to be of female gender or a racial minority when compared to individuals living in low poverty areas. Residence in a high poverty area was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization and was found to be associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality. This study suggests the existence of an unequal socioeconomic gradient in the demographic and clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients including differences in age, gender and race between poverty groups.

The key component of VV-ECMO is the double-lumen cannula (DLC) that enables single-site access. The biofluid dynamics of this compact device is particularly challenging for neonatal patients due to high Reynolds numbers, tricuspid valve location and right-atrium hemodynamics. In this paper we present detailed findings of our comparative analysis of the right-atrial hemodynamics and salient design features of the 13Fr Avalon Elite DLC (as the clinically preferred neonatal cannula) with the alternate Origen DLC design, using experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics. Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.","output":"Hemodynamic performance limits of the neonatal Double-Lumen cannula."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With technological progress in particular telemedicine and health care, the information should meet and serve as well the needs of people and in particular whom with reduced mobility, the elderly as well as people with difficulties to access to medical resources and services.

This review summarizes certain phytochemical agents along with their mode of actions and potential antiviral activities against important viral pathogens. A special focus has been given on medicinal plants and their extracts as well as herbs which have shown promising results to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 as alternatives for treatment under phytotherapy approaches during this devastating pandemic situation.","output":"Medicinal Plants, Phytochemicals, and Herbs to Combat Viral Pathogens Including SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Working as an Australian hospital Social Worker during a major viral pandemic was always going to be an unpredictable and rapidly evolving experience We knew the COVID-19 virus was coming, within weeks it had arrived, and Australian society transformed overnight With so much rapid loss and change our sense of mastery over our lives was quickly lost Health services and individuals alike battled to prepare, to understand, and to make meaning in a new world It was an opportunity to seek meaning in literatures both professional and artistic ?

This constant monitoring process enables instructors to dynamically adapt the training activities according to the perceived student reactions, which aims to keep them engaged in the learning process. However, when shifting from face-to-face to synchronous virtual learning environments (VLEs), assessing to what extent students are engaged to the training process during the lecture has become a challenging and arduous task. Typical indicators such as students faces, gestural poses, or even hearing their voice can be easily masked by the intrinsic nature of the virtual domain (e.g., cameras and microphones can be turned off). The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology and its associated model to measure student engagement in VLEs that can be obtained from the systematic analysis of more than 30 types of digital interactions and events during a synchronous lesson. To validate the feasibility of this approach, a software prototype has been implemented to measure student engagement in two different learning activities in a synchronous learning session: a masterclass and a hands-on session. The obtained results aim to help those instructors who feel that the connection with their students has weakened due to the virtuality of the learning environment.","output":"A Data-Driven Approach to Quantify and Measure Students Engagement in Synchronous Virtual Learning Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular knowledge of biological processes is a cornerstone in omics data analysis.

T1 (highest red and far-red, low blue) and T3 (high red, balanced blue, green and far-red) led to a better developed photosynthetic apparatus compared to T2 (red peak in 631 nm) and T4 (highest blue and green), highlighted by PIABS and its structural components: RC/ABS, P0, E0, and VIP. Elevated salinity only affected the latter parameter. T1 induced the maximum yield production but also the highest nitrate content which was far below the maximum level permitted by European legislation.

The ASFV has brought enormous economic loss to many countries, and no effective vaccine or treatment for the ASFV is currently available. Therefore, the on-site rapid and accurate detection of the ASFV is key to the timely implementation of control. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR effector CRISPR-associated 13 (Cas13a; previously known as C2c2) exhibits a collateral effect of promiscuous RNase activity upon the target recognition. The collateral cleavage activity of LwCas13a is activated to degrade the non-targeted RNA, when the crRNA of LwCas13a binds to the target RNA. In this study, we developed a rapid and sensitive ASFV detection method based on the collateral cleavage activity of LwCas13a, which combines recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) and a lateral flow strip (named CRISPR/Cas13a-LFD). The method was an isothermal detection at 37 C, and the detection can be used for visual readout. The detection limit of the CRISPR/Cas13a-LFD was 10(1) copies/L of p72 gene per reaction, and the detection process can be completed within an hour.

Using a national sample, 300 caregivers of children ages 6-18 were surveyed using Amazon Mechanical Turk platform during the first three months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Caregivers reported on family demographics, COVID-19-related stress, engagement in family routines (prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic), stress mindset, self-efficacy, and family resiliency. Overall, families reported engaging in fewer routines during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to the pandemic. COVID-19-related stress was highest in low-income families, families of healthcare workers, and among caregivers who had experienced the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, COVID-19-related stress was negatively related to self-efficacy, positively related to an enhancing stress mindset, and negatively related to family resilience. Engagement in family routines buffered relations between COVID-19-related stress and family resilience, such that COVID-19-related stress was not associated with lower family resilience among families that engaged in high levels of family routines.

Documenting how the COVID-19 affects diets, nutrition and food security can help generating evidence-informed recommendations for mitigating interventions and policies. Methods We carried out a systematic literature review. A structure search strategy was applied in MEDLINE (Pubmed?), EMBASE?, Scopus? and Web of Science?. Grey literature was retrieved by screening a pre-set list of institutions involved in monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on nutrition and food security. The first search was done on 20th August 2020, and updated in mid-November 2020 and mid-January 2021. All research steps were described as recommended in the PRISMA statement. Results Out of the 2085 references identified, thirty-five primary studies were included. In spite of their heterogeneity, studies converge to demonstrate a detrimental effect of COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures on diet quality and food insecurity. One of the major direct effects of COVID-19 on food and nutrition outcomes has been through its impact on employment, income generating activities and associated purchasing power. Other channels of impact, such as physical access, availability and affordability of food provided a heterogeneous picture and were assessed via binary and often simplistic questions. The impacts of COVID-19 manifested with various intensity degrees, duration and in different forms. Factors contributing to these variations between and within countries were: 1) timing, duration and stringency of national COVID-19 restriction measures and policies to mitigate their adverse impacts; 2) context specific food value chain responses to domestic and international containment measures; 3) differentiated impacts of restriction measures on different groups, along lines of gender, age, socio-economic status and employment conditions. Dietary changes and food insecurity manifested various intensity degrees, duration and in different forms between and within countries. Shorter value chains and traditional smallholder farms were somewhat more resilient in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the impact of the pandemic has been particularly adverse on women, individuals with a low socio-economic status, informal workers and young adults that relied on daily wages. Finally, there were heterogeneous government responses to curb the virus and to mitigate the damaging effects of the pandemic. It has been demonstrated that existing and well-functioning social protection programmes and public distribution of food can buffer the adverse effects on food insecurity. But social safety nets cannot be effective on their own and there is a need for broader food systems interventions and investments to support sustainable and inclusive food systems to holistic achieve food and nutrition security. Conclusion In conclusion, the current economic and heath crisis impact diet quality and food security, and this raises concerns about long term impacts on access to and affordability of nutrient-rich, healthy diets and their health implications. Women and individuals with a low socio-economic are the most at risk of food insecurity. Social safety nets can be effective to protect them and must be urgently implemented. We advocate for improved data collection to identify vulnerable groups and measure how interventions are successful in protecting them.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on diet quality, food security and nutrition in Low and Middle Income Countries: A systematic review of the evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has highly variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening disease.

These sounds were recorded by 120 COVID-19 and 120 healthy subjects via a smartphone microphone through a website application. A deep learning framework was proposed herein the relies on hand-crafted features extracted from the original recordings and from the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as well as deep-activated features learned by a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory units (CNN-BiLSTM). Analysis of the normal distribution of the combined MFCC values showed that COVID-19 subjects tended to have a distribution that is skewed more towards the right side of the zero mean (shallow: 0.59{+/-}1.74, deep: 0.65{+/-}4.35).

At the beginning, patients may have normal lung compliance and be responsive to noninvasive ventilatory support, such as CPAP. However, the transition to more severe respiratory failure - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), necessitating invasive ventilation is often abrupt and characterized by a severe V/Q mismatch that require cycles of prone positioning. The aim of this case is to report the effect on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics of tripod (or orthopneic sitting position) used as an alternative to prone position in a patient with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ventilated with helmet CPAP. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old awake and collaborating male patient with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and ventilated with Helmet CPAP, showed sudden worsening of gas exchange without dyspnea. After an unsuccessful attempt of prone positioning, we alternated three-hours cycles of semi-recumbent and tripod position, still keeping him in CPAP. Arterial blood gases (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaCO2 and A/a gradient), respiratory (VE, VT, RR) and hemodynamic parameters (HR, MAP) were collected in the supine and tripod position. Cycles of tripod position were continued for 3 days. The patient had a clinically important improvement in arterial blood gases and respiratory parameters, with stable hemodynamic and was successfully weaned and discharged to ward 10 days after pneumonia onset. CONCLUSIONS: Tripod position during Helmet CPAP can be applied safely in patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, with improvement of oxygenation and V/Q matching, thus reducing the need for intubation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia succesfully treated with cpap and cycles of tripod position: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This mini review includes two case descriptions.

It is generally accepted that a new procedure will undergo technical changes during its evolution; however, quantitative accounts of the process are limited. METHODS Multiple groups, including our own, have recently described a minimally-invasive approach to conventional kidney transplantation (KT) operation. Unique to our experience is a structured development of the technique within the confines of a safe surgical innovation framework - the IDEAL framework (idea, development, exploration, assessment, long-term monitoring; stages 0-4). We here provide a first-hand narrative of the progress of robotic KT operation from preclinical trial to clinical application. RESULTS Overall, 54 patients underwent robotic KT with regional hypothermia successfully. Major technical changes including selection of optimal patient position (flank vs. lithotomy), robotic instrumentation, vascular occlusion method (bulldog vs. tourniquet) and suture material (prolene vs. GoreTex) occurred early during the procedure development (IDEAL stage 0, preclinical). Minor technical changes such as utilization of the aortic punch for arteriotomy (case 3), use of barbed suture during ureteroneocystostomy (case 6) and extraperitonealization of the graft kidney (case 6) that increased the efficiency and safety of the procedure continued throughout procedure development (IDEAL stages 1-2, clinical stages). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that a surgical technique evolves continually; although, the majority of technical alterations occur early in the life-cycle of the procedure.

The survey collected data on demographics, patterns of using greenspace during the pandemic, and major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) were applied to identify probable cases of MD and GAD. A logistic regression model assessed the association decreased visits to greenspace after the outbreak compared to 2019 and probable MD and GAD. Among the 322 survey participants, prevalence of probable MD and GAD were 19.3% and 14.9%, respectively. High rates of probable MD (23.3%) and GAD (19.4%) were found among persons currently having job-related and financial issues. Of the total participants, 64.9% reported decreased visits to greenspace after the COVID-19 outbreak. Persons with decreased visits to greenspace had 2.06 higher odds (95% CI: 0.91, 4.67, significant at p < 0.10) of probable MD at the time of the survey than persons whose visits to greenspace increased or did not change. Decreased visits to greenspace were not significantly associated with GAD (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63, 3.34). Findings suggest that barriers to greenspace use could deprive people of mental health benefits and affect mental health during pandemic; an alternative explanation is that those experiencing poor mental health may be less likely to visit greenspaces during pandemic. This implies the need of adequate interventions on greenspace uses under an outbreak especially focusing on how low-income populations may be more adversely affected by a pandemic and its policy responses.","output":"Impact of Changed Use of Greenspace during COVID-19 Pandemic on Depression and Anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herzrhythmusst?rungen und St?rungen der Erregungsleitung treten beim Intensivpatienten relativ h?ufig auf.

MethodsSystematic search was conducted on April 6th, 2022, on databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus). VE difference (VED) estimates were assessed using random-effects model and DerSimonian-Laird tau estimators. Two models result, i.e., within 3 months and within 3 months or more, are compared. VE versus time meta-regression analysis was evaluated using mixed-effects model with Restricted-Maximum Likelihood tau estimators and Hartung-Knapp adjustments. FindingsAd26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and mRNA-1273 vaccines were included in the analyses. Compared to full dose, booster dose of overall vaccines provided better protection against any (VED=22% (95%CI 15%-29%), p<0.001), severe (VED=20% (95%CI 8%-32%), p=0.001) and symptomatic (VED=22% (95%CI 11%-34%), p<0.001) Omicron infections within 3 months, as well as within 3 months or more (VED=30% (95%CI 24%-37%), p<0.001 for any, VED=18% (95%CI 13%-23%), p<0.001 for severe and VED=37% (95%CI 29%-46%), p<0.001 for symptomatic infections). The meta-regression analysis of overall vaccines revealed that the full dose VE against any and symptomatic Omicron infections were significantly reduced each month by 3.0% (95%CI 0.9%-4.8%, p=0.004) and 5.2% (95%CI 3.3%-7.1%, p=0.006), respectively; whereas booster dose effectiveness against severe and symptomatic Omicron infections were decreased by 3.7% (95%CI 5.1%-12.6%, p=0.030) and 3.9% (95%CI 1.2%-6.5%, p=0.006), respectively. InterpretationCompared to full dose only, a booster dose addition provides better protection against B.1.1.529 infection. Although the VE estimates of Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and mRNA-1273 vaccines against B.1.1.529 infection after both full and booster doses are generally moderate, and the booster dose provides excellent protection against severe infection, it is important to note that the VE estimates decline over time, suggesting the need for a regular Covid-19 booster injection after certain period of time to maintain VE.","output":"Effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529): A systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Dermatophytosis is an infectious disease of global significance caused by several fungal species, which affects the hair, nails, or superficial layers of the skin. The most common zoonotic dermatophytes are Microsporum canis, Nannizzia gypsea and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Woods lamp examination, microscopic identification and fungal culture are the main conventional diagnostic methods used in clinics. Less common methods are dermatophyte PCR and biopsy/histopathology. However, these methods also have limitations for providing both accuracy and timely on-site detection. The recent development of CRISPR-based diagnostic platform provides the possibility of a rapid, accurate, and portable diagnostic tool, which has huge potential for clinical applications. Objectives The purpose of this study is to establish a molecular method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of clinical dermatophytes, which can accelerate clinical diagnostic testing and help timely treatment. Methods In this paper, we design a Cas12a-based assay combined with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) to differentiate three main zoonotic dermatophytes. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined by using standard strains. A total of 25 clinical samples (hair and scurf) are identified to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this assay. Results The RPA-Cas12a method showed high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 100%, respectively). The results could be observed directly by naked-eyes, and all tested samples were consistent with fungal culture and sequencing results. Conclusions Compared with other methods, the RPA-Cas12a-fluorescence assay requires less time (30 minutes) and less complicated equipment, and visible changes can be clearly observed, which is suitable for on-site clinical diagnosis.","output":"Rapid and Visible RPA-Cas12a fluorescence Assay for Accurate Detection of Zoonotic Dermatophytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whatsapp as one of the most popular social media and widely used by people in Indonesia.

One of the medical fields that may experience significant consequences of the pandemic is that of psychiatry. Importantly, individuals who already live with mental disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological stress associated with the pandemic. However, data on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects this group of people is largely absent from the literature. Here, we report data from a quality development project conducted at the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region (CDR), which has a catchment area of approximately 1.3 million people covered by five psychiatric hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient treatment of all types of mental disorders. Based on a manual screening of all clinical notes from the period from February 1st to March 23rd 2020 that contained at least one of the following words: corona, COVID, virus, epidemic, pandemic, and contaminate/contamination (including compound words), we found 1357 notes from 918 adult patients that described pandemic-related psychopathology (symptoms that appeared to be caused/deteriorated by the pandemic and/or its societal consequences). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology from a large psychiatric treatment setting. The results clearly suggest that this phenomenon exists among individuals with mental illness. However, as the data from this investigation stems from standard clinical practice where the patients were not systematically assessed for pandemic-related psychopathology, we cannot speak to its overall prevalence. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings underline the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with mental disorders. A low-cost intervention would be to simply discuss the ongoing pandemic and its societal consequences with patients seeking care in psychiatric settings - as this may lead to relief of pandemic-related symptoms via general comforting, and clarification of misunderstandings/false beliefs regarding the pandemic.","output":"Psychiatric Symptoms Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: In patients who receive antiplatelet therapy (APT), the bleeding risk profile after mild head trauma (MHT) still needs clarification. Some studies have demonstrated an association with bleeding risk, whereas others have not. We studied the population of our level II emergency department (ED) trauma center to determine the risk of bleeding in patients receiving APT and whether bleeding results not from antiplatelet agents but rather from age. We assessed the bleeding risk, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) that necessitated hospitalization for observation, the need for cranial neurosurgery, the severity of the patients condition at discharge, and the frequency of ED revisits for head trauma in patients receiving APT. Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 483 patients receiving APT who were in the ED for MHT in 2019. The control group consisted of 1443 patients in the ED with MHT over the same period who were not receiving APT or anticoagulant therapy. Our ED diagnostic therapeutic protocol mandates both triage and the medical examination to identify patients with MHT who are taking any anticoagulant or APT. Results: APT was not significantly associated with bleeding risk (p > 0.05); as a risk factor, age was significantly associated with the risk of bleeding, even after adjustment for therapy. Patients receiving APT had a greater need of surgery (1.2% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.0001) and a higher rate of hospitalization (52.9% vs. 37.4%; p < 0.0001), and their clinical condition was more severe (evaluated according to the exit code value on a one-dimensional quantitative five-point numerical scale) at the time of discharge (p = 0.013). The frequency of ED revisits due to head trauma did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: The risk of bleeding in patients receiving APT who had MHT was no higher than that in the control group. However, the clinical condition of patients receiving APT, including hospital admission for ICH monitoring and cranial neurosurgical interventions, was more severe.","output":"Mild Head Trauma: Is Antiplatelet Therapy a Risk Factor for Hemorrhagic Complications?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Municipal bond markets experienced a significant amount of strain in response to the COVID-19 crisis, creating liquidity and credit concerns among market participants.

Outcome Measures Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results of Base-Case Analysis Without surveillance or screening, lifetime CRC incidence for patients aged 50 years was 10.9% after LRA removal and 17.2% after HRA removal at screening colonoscopy. Subsequent colonoscopic screening, low-intensity surveillance, or high-intensity surveillance decreased incidence by 39%, 46% to 48%, and 55% to 56%, respectively. Incidence of CRC and surveillance benefits were higher for adenomas detected at FIT screening and lower for older patients.

However, there is uncertainty regarding whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was acquired at work versus in the community. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to examine exposure history of personnel with COVID-19 infection or asymptomatic carriage in a VA healthcare system. High-risk exposures were classified based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. RESULTS: Of 578 personnel tested, 49 (8%) had nasopharyngeal swabs with positive PCR results, including 45 (92%) with and 4 (8%) without COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 49 cases, 21 (43%) had a documented high-risk exposure at work, including 14 exposures to COVID-19 patients and 7 exposures to colonized or infected personnel. Exposures to infected patients most often were a result of delays in recognition of COVID-19 due to atypical presentations. Exposures to personnel with COVID-19 most often involved activities such as meals when facemasks were not worn. Most cases occurred among nurses (26, 53%) and administrative personnel (10, 20%); only 3 physicians developed COVID-19. No cases occurred in personnel working on COVID-19 wards. All personnel had mild or moderate disease. CONCLUSION: Forty-three percent of healthcare personnel with COVID-19 had prior high-risk exposures at work.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021).

However, image distortions caused by gradient non-linearity (GNL) can have detrimental impacts on real-time radiotherapy using MRI-Linac systems, where accurate geometric information of tumours is essential. METHODS: In this work, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network-based method to efficiently recover undistorted images (ReUINet) for real-time image guidance. The ReUINet, based on the encoder-decoder structure, was created to learn the relationship between the undistorted images and distorted images. The ReUINet was pre-trained and tested on a publically available brain MR image dataset acquired from 23 volunteers. Then, transfer-learning was adopted to implement the pre-trained model (i.e., network with optimal weights) on the experimental 3D grid phantom and in-vivo pelvis image datasets acquired from the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac system. RESULTS: Evaluations on the phantom (768 slices) and pelvis data (88 slices) showed that the ReUINet achieved over 15-times and 45-times improvement on computational efficiency in comparison with standard interpolation and GNL-encoding methods, respectively. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the ReUINet provided better correction results than the standard interpolation method, and comparable performance compared to the GNL-encoding approach. CONCLUSIONS: Validated by simulation and experimental results, the proposed ReUINet showed promise in obtaining accurate MR images for the implementation of real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy.","output":"ReUINet: a Fast GNL Distortion Correction Approach on a 1.0T MRI-Linac Scanner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, we suggested that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) transplantation can significantly improve coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms based on evidential relations (10.4252/wjsc.v12.i8.721).

However, the incidence and outcomes of IPA following other RVIs is not well-described. We hypothesized that IPA may be an underreported complication of non-influenza RVIs. The objective of this study was to quantify the incidence and associated outcomes of IPA following RVI in hospitalized patients. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of adult hospitalized patients with RVI diagnosed by multiplex PCR-based assay at the University of Kansas Hospital (Kansas City, Kansas) from September 2018-October 2019. Patients with a diagnosis of proven or probable IPA prior to RVI and those with hospital admission < 24 h were excluded from analysis. Proven or probable IPA was defined according to EORTC/MSGERC consensus definitions. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Results A total of 195 patients met study criteria and were included in the analysis. The most common types of RVI observed were rhinovirus/enterovirus (57.9%, n=113), parainfluenza (13.3%, n=26), influenza (8.2%, n=16), and respiratory syncytial virus (7.7%, n=15). The cumulative incidence of IPA infection within 6 weeks of RVI was 5.6% (n=11). Excluding patients co-infected with multiple respiratory viruses (n=5), IPA was numerically more likely to occur following influenza compared to non-influenza RVI (12.5% [ n=2/16] vs. 4.6% [n=8/174];odds ratio, 2.96;95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-15.3;P=0.176). Overall, one-year all-cause mortality was 20% (n=39/195) in this cohort. Development of IPA as a complication of RVI was associated with a significant decrease in 1-year survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.04;95% CI, 1.19-7.78;P=0.021), and this relationship persisted after adjustment for age (HR, 2.77;95% CI, 1.08-7.10;P=0.034). Conclusion In a cohort of hospitalized patients with RVI, 5.6% of patients developed proven or probable IPA. Although IPA was more likely to occur in patients with influenza, this complication was also observed with other types of RVI. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may be an underappreciated complication of non-influenza RVI in hospitalized patients and warrants continued study.

Results: Consequently, 60 studies were included in the present qualitative synthesis. Data on models, high-fat diet, intervention time, outcome measures, efficacy, and mechanisms were collected. Finally, 23 formulas that could alleviate AS were correlated to the amelioration of plaques, improvement of plaque stability, modification of lipid level and lipid metabolism, and the effects of anti-inflammation and antioxidant stress with multiple components and targets. However, the methodological quality was low and incomplete among the included literature.

However, the stay-at-home order could have reduced PA the most, i.e., the ban of unnecessary outdoor activities. It affected free walking, running, skiing, active tourism, etc. It is, therefore, crucial to estimate how the stay-at-home order affected PA. We estimated how the stay-at-home order affected perceived PA and sedentary behavior compared to the pre-pandemic time in Poland. METHODS: We used a self-reported International Physical Activity QuestionnaireLong Form (IPAQ-LF) to estimate the time (minutes per day) of vigorous and moderate PA and walking and sitting time. RESULTS: We gathered data from 320 Polish participants. Bayesian approaches, including t-test and Bayesian correlations, were used to find differences and correlations between PA before and during the stay-at-home lockdown. Our data supported the hypotheses that vigorous PA, as well as walking, declined during the lockdown. Surprisingly, our data did not support the hypothesis that moderate physical activity was reduced. We found that moderate PA during lockdown increased compared to the pre-lockdown PA. As hypothesized, our data strongly evinced that sitting time inclined during the lockdown. PA decline was not correlated with the available living space. People who had access to gardens did not demonstrate a higher PA level than those without. DISCUSSION: Walking and sitting time have drastically changed during the stay-at-home lockdown, decreasing and increasing, respectively. Given results from studies focusing on lockdowns without the stay-at-home restriction, it may be assumed that letting people go outside is crucial in keeping them more active and less sedentary. Authorities should take into account the effect the stay-at-home order may have on PA and sedentary behavior and as a result, on health. Stay-at-home orders should be the last considered restriction, given its detrimental consequences.","output":"Perceived physical activity during stay-at-home COVID-19 pandemic lockdown MarchCApril 2020 in Polish adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>To investigate the consequence of COVID-19 pandemic on the financial reporting and disclosure (FRD) practices, the study has been conducted.

The study was approved by Ethical Committee, Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi (IRB form no.905/Trg-ABP 1K2). A qualitative questionnaire was developed and was shared via different social networks. The questionnaire was closed when 241 responses were received. Statistical Analysis Descriptive analysis was performed on demographic data. Chi-squared analysis was performed between demographic data and PPE-usage patterns among participants with or without de novo headaches. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare variables with the development of new-onset headaches. Chi-squared test was also performed between demographic data and other factors that may be causing new-onset headaches. A p -value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 241 healthcare workers participated, of which 68 participants (28.2%) reported de novo headaches since the start of the pandemic. Incidence of pre-existing headaches (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99C0.37; p = 0.049) was associated with new-onset headaches. Post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis stated that incidence of pre-existing headaches (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 0.94C3.78; p = 0.75) and age (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.47C10.33; p = 0.36) was independently associated with new-onset PPE-induced headaches but was not statistically significant. Chi-squared analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between other factors (sleep deprivation, emotional stress, etc.) and department of activity, gender, and occupation ( p < 0.05). Conclusion Healthcare workers with previous history of pre-existing headaches were found to be more susceptible to PPE-induced headaches during COVID-19 pandemic.

For modeling, the airborne bacteria's inactivation was determined by critical survival fraction probability (CSFP) and maximal bearable UV dose (MBUD) methods, respectively. The results indicated that Lagrangian modeling utilizing the MBUD method needs to appropriately evaluate the maximal UV dose (D(mb)), which is bearable for airborne microorganisms. The disinfection efficacy obtained by using the CSFP method agreed well with experimental measurements. Within the Lagrangian framework, the recommended empirical value for critical survival fraction (F(sc)) was 0.4 for modeling the disinfection efficacy of in-duct UV lamps.

Changes in health seeking behavior (HSB) during the outbreak resulted in dramatic underreporting and substantial declines in hospital presentations to public health facilities, resulting in an estimated tens of thousands of additional maternal, infant, and adult deaths per year. Sierra Leones Kenema District, a major Ebola hotspot, is also endemic for Lassa fever (LF), another often-fatal hemorrhagic disease. Here we assess the impact of the West African Ebola epidemic on health seeking behaviors with respect to presentations to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) Lassa Ward, which serves as the primary health care referral center for suspected Lassa fever cases in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Presentation frequencies for suspected Lassa fever presenting to KGH or one of its referral centers from 2011C2019 were analyzed to consider the potential impact of the West African Ebola epidemic on presentation patterns. There was a significant decline in suspected LF cases presenting to KGH following the epidemic, and a lower percentage of subjects were admitted to the KGH Lassa Ward following the epidemic. To assess general HSB, a questionnaire was developed and administered to 200 residents from 8 villages in Kenema District. Among 194 completed interviews, 151 (78%) of respondents stated they felt hospitals were safer post-epidemic with no significant differences noted among subjects according to religious background, age, gender, or education. However, 37 (19%) subjects reported decreased attendance at hospitals since the epidemic, which suggests that trust in the healthcare system has not fully rebounded. Cost was identified as a major deterrent to seeking healthcare. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of patient demographic data suggests that fewer individuals sought care for Lassa fever and other febrile illnesses in Kenema District after the West African Ebola epidemic. Re-establishing trust in health care services will require efforts beyond rebuilding infrastructure and require concerted efforts to rebuild the trust of local residents who may be wary of seeking healthcare post epidemic.","output":"Health seeking behavior after the 2013C16 Ebola epidemic: Lassa fever as a metric of persistent changes in Kenema District, Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with cancer are prone to develop venous thromboembolism (VTE) that is the second leading cause of mortality among them.

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and analytical statistics (Chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests) were performed at a 95% significance level using STATA software version 15 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: From 6600 participants, 4775 responded (response rate = 72.3%). Of the participants, 1460 (30.6%) received the AstraZeneca vaccine, 1564 (32.8%) received the Sinopharm vaccine and 1751 (36.7%) received the Sputnik V vaccine. 2653 participants (55.56%) reported adverse effects after the first dose and 1704 (35.7%) after the second dose. Sputnik V caused the most adverse effects with 1449 (82.7%) vaccine recipients reporting symptoms after the first or second dose, compared with 1030 (70.5%) for AstraZeneca and only 585 (37.4%) for the Sinopharm vaccine. The most common adverse effects after the first dose were fatigue (28.37%), chill/fever (26.86%), and skeletal pain (22.38%). These three adverse effects were the same for the second dose, although their prevalence was lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate that the Sputnik V vaccine has the highest rate of adverse effects, followed by the AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines used in Iran are safe and there were no reports of serious adverse effects.

The descriptive spatiotemporal analysis showed a clear NorthCSouth gradient, where northern regions tended to report more pneumonia- and influenza-related deaths. After adjustment for potential confounders, it was found that each 1% increase in influenza vaccination coverage rate would be associated (P < .001) with a 1.6C1.9% decrease in pneumonia- and influenza-related mortality. Moreover, each 1% increase in the use of MF59?-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine would be associated (P < .05) with a further 0.4% decrease in pneumonia- and influenza-related mortality.

METHODS: This retrospective study included 164 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom a CT chest examination was performed at a single institution between April 2020 and July 2020. Of them, 101 patients was RT-PCR positive for COVID-19. Six readers with varying radiological experience (two each of chest radiologists, general radiologists, and radiologists in training) independently assigned a CO-RADS assessment category for each CT chest study. The Fleiss K was used to quantify inter-observer agreement. The inter-observer agreement was also assessed based on the duration of onset of symptoms to CT scan. ROC curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CO-RADS. The area under curve was calculated to determine the reader accuracy for detection of COVID-19 lung involvement with RT-PCR as reference standards. The data sets were plotted in ROC space, and Youdens J statistic was calculated to determine the threshold cut-off CO-RADS category for COVID-19 positivity. RESULTS: There was overall moderate inter-observer agreement between all readers (Fleiss K 0.54 [95% CI 0.54, 0.54]), with substantial agreement among chest radiologists (Fleiss K 0.68 [95% CI 0.67, 0.68]), general radiologists (Fleiss K 0.61 [95% CI 0.61, 0.61]), and moderate agreement among radiologists-in-training (Fleiss K 0.56 [95% CI 0.56, 0.56]). There was overall moderate inter-observer agreement in early disease (stages 1 and 2), with cumulative Fleiss K 0.45 [95% CI 0.45, 0.45]). The overall AUC for CO-RADS lexicon scheme to accurately diagnose COVID-19 yielded 0.92 (95% CI 0.91, 0.94) with strong concordance within and between groups, of chests radiologists with AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88, 0.94), general radiologists with AUC 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98), and radiologists in training with AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.87, 0.94). For detecting COVID-19, ROC curve analysis yielded CO-RADS > 3 as the cut-off threshold with sensitivity 90% (95% CI 0.88, 0.93), and specificity of 87% (95% CI 0.83, 0.91).

Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

After each in-custody death, ICE produces detainee death reviews, which describe the circumstances of the death and determine whether ICE Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) were violated. OBJECTIVE: To describe factors associated with deaths in ICE detention facilities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series used data extracted from detainee death reviews of deaths among individuals detained in ICE facilities for whom these reviews were available from January 2011 to December 2018. EXPOSURES: All individuals were in the custody of ICE at the time of death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data including demographic information, medical histories, recorded medical data, and reported violations of PBNDS were systematically extracted and summarized. RESULTS: Among 71 individuals who died in an ICE detention facility during the study period, detainee death reviews were available for 55 (77.5%). Most were male (47 [85.5%]), and the mean (SD) age at death was 42.7 (11.5) years. Individuals resided in the US for a mean (SD) of 15.8 (13.2) years before detention and were in ICE custody for a median of 39 days (interquartile range, 9-76 days) before death. Most had low burdens of preexisting disease, with 18 (32.7%) having a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 0 and 15 (27.3%) having a score of 1 or 2. A total of 47 deaths (85.5%) were attributed to medical causes and 8 (14.5%) to suicide. Markedly abnormal vital signs were documented in the death reviews before 29 of 47 deaths from medical causes (61.7%), and 21 of these 29 deaths (72.4%) were preceded by abnormal vital signs during 2 or more encounters with ICE personnel before death or terminal hospital transfer. Overall, 43 detainee death reviews (78.2%) identified PBNDS violations related to medical care, with a mean (SD) of 3.2 (3.0) deficiencies per detainee death review. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case series, deaths in ICE detention facilities from 2011 to 2018 occurred primarily among young men with low burdens of preexisting disease. Markedly abnormal vital signs preceded death or hospital transfer for most nonsuicide deaths. The PBNDS were violated in most detainee death reviews. These results suggest that additional oversight and external evaluation of practices related to medical and psychiatric care within ICE facilities are needed.","output":"Characteristics of Deaths Among Individuals in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detention Facilities, 2011-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims to apply the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to model workplace safety in the Oil and Gas Industry (OGI) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A number of positive and negative factors constantly shape the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalization, and mortality. Among these factors, the rise in increasingly transmissible variants on one side and the effect of vaccinations on the other side create a picture deeply different from that of the first pandemic wave. Starting from the observation that in several European countries the number of COVID-19 infections in the second and third pandemic wave increased without a proportional rise in disease severity and mortality, we hypothesize the existence of an additional factor influencing SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. This factor consists of an immune defence against severe COVID-19, provided by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells progressively developing upon natural exposure to low virus doses present in populated environments. As suggested by recent studies, low-dose viral particles entering the respiratory and intestinal tracts may be able to induce T cell memory in the absence of inflammation, potentially resulting in different degrees of immunization. In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical interventions would play a double role, one in the short term by reducing the detrimental spreading of SARS-CoV-2 particles, and one in the long term by allowing the development of a widespread (although heterogeneous and uncontrollable) form of immune protection.","output":"Repeated Exposure to Subinfectious Doses of SARS-CoV-2 May Promote T Cell Immunity and Protection against Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"p-Hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA), which exists extensively in plants, is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects, but various adverse side effects have also been reported.

This study investigated determinants of formal and informal help-seeking by those who had experienced lifetime physical, sexual or psychological IPV. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based New Zealand study conducted from 2017 to 2019 recruited 2,887 participants (1,464 women and 1,423 men) aged 16 years and older. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Of these, 1,373 participants experienced physical, sexual or psychological IPV. Two series of logistic regressions were conducted: 1) comparing those who sought help with those who did not, and 2) comparing those who had not sought help with those who sought informal help only, or with those who also sought formal help. RESULTS: Of the 1,373 participants who reported experience of physical, sexual or psychological IPV 835 participants (71.3% of women and 49.0% of men) sought some form of help. In both genders self-reported physical and mental health or work-related IPV impacts were significantly associated with help-seeking.

This article used exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to test the reliability and validity of each factor system and its measurement scale. The variance analysis is used to judge the differences between the elements. The regression analysis is used to verify the hypothesis of a causal relationship between factors. The structural equation analysis is used to fit the model and make necessary amendments. The results reveal that the government service environment has a significant positive impact on the ability of an entrepreneur. In addition, the regional soft environment significantly impacts the competitive advantage of small- and medium-sized tourism and hospitality enterprises in Macao. Contrary, the impact of laws of Macao on the acquisition of financial resources and the promotion of entrepreneur ability and innovation ability is found insignificant. In conclusion, the results showed that market of Macao lacks venture investors where enterprises cannot obtain funds through angel financing or risk financing.","output":"Study on Survival and Sustainable Development of Small- and Medium-Sized Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises in Macao Based on Regional Soft Environment and Competitive Advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) strategy and its effect on implementation leadership, transformational leadership, and implementation climate. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized study design enrolling 47 first-level leaders from child- and adult-specialized mental health clinics within Norwegian health trusts across three cohorts. All therapists (n = 790) received training in screening of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress, and a subgroup of therapists (n = 248) received training in evidence-based treatment methods for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First-level leaders and therapists completed surveys at baseline, 4, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-months assessing leadership and implementation climate. General linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate whether the LOCI strategy would lead to greater therapist-rated scores on implementation leadership, transformational leadership, and implementation climate. RESULTS: After introducing the LOCI strategy, there was a significant increase in therapist-rated implementation and transformational leadership and implementation climate. The increase was sustained at all measurement time points compared to non-LOCI conditions, which demonstrated a steady decrease in scores before LOCI. CONCLUSIONS: The LOCI strategy can develop better transformational and implementation leadership skills and contribute to a more positive implementation climate, which may enhance successful EBP implementation. Thus, LOCI can help leaders create an organizational context conducive for effective EBP implementation.

In this work, we chose a model plant, wheat, as the test material to determine the effects of applying 10 mg/kg S-ME to soil on its fresh weight, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the diversity and structural composition of the phyllosphere microorganisms after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Our work showed that this concentration of residual S-ME in soil only slightly decreased plant biomass and had little effect on lipid peroxidation, the antioxidant enzyme system and chlorophyll content. Interestingly, although the test concentration of S-ME did not exert strong inhibitory effects on the physiological activities of wheat, it decreased the diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities and changed their structure, indicating that microorganisms were more sensitive stress indicators. S-ME reduced the colonization by some beneficial bacteria related to plant nitrogen fixation among the phyllosphere microorganisms, which influenced the growth and yield of wheat because these bacteria contribute to plant fitness. In addition, S-ME affected the association between the host and the composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities under different growth conditions. Our work provides insights into the ecological implications of the effects of herbicides on the phyllosphere microbiome.","output":"Effects of residual S-metolachlor in soil on the phyllosphere microbial communities of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been substantial research on megaprojects in project management literature.

However, there are few epidemiological studies investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and the incidence of disability. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the incidence of disability in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and to verify whether there are sex differences in this association. METHODS: A 4-y follow-up study was conducted involving individuals aged 50 y or older who participated in ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). The sample consisted of 4814 participants free of disability at baseline according to the modified Katz Index. Vitamin D was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and the participants were classified as sufficient (>50 nmol/L), insufficient (>30 to &#8804;50 nmol/L), or deficient (&#8804;30 nmol/L). Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were also investigated. BADL were re-evaluated after 2 and 4 y of follow-up. The report of any difficulty to perform &#8805;1 BADL was considered as an incident case of disability. Poisson models stratified by sex and controlled for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were carried out. RESULTS: After 4-y follow-up, deficient serum 25(OH)D was a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in both women (IRR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.03) and men (IRR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.02). However, insufficient serum 25(OH)D was not a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS: Independently of sex, deficient serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with increased risk of incidence of BADL disability in adults >50 y old and should be an additional target of clinical strategies to prevent disability in these populations.","output":"Association of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Deficiency with Risk of Incidence of Disability in Basic Activities of Daily Living in Adults >50 Years of Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been posited that populations being exposed to long-term air pollution are more susceptible to COVID-19 Evidence is emerging that long-term exposure to ambient PM2 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2 5 mum or less) associates with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, but whether it also associates with the speed at which the disease is capable of spreading in a population is unknown Here, we establish the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2 5 in the United States (US) and COVID-19 basic reproduction ratio R0- a dimensionless epidemic measure of the rapidity of disease spread through a population We inferred state-level R0 values using a state-of-the-art susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model initialized with COVID-19 epidemiological data corresponding to the period March 2-April 30 This period was characterized by a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases across the US states, implementation of strict social distancing measures, and a significant drop in outdoor air pollution We find that an increase of 1 mug/m3 in PM2 5 levels below current national ambient air quality standards associates with an increase of 0 25 in R0 (95% CI: 0 048-0 447) A 10% increase in secondary inorganic composition, sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, in PM2 5 associates with =10% increase in R0 by 0 22 (95% CI: 0 083-0 352), and presence of black carbon (soot) in the ambient environment moderates this relationship We considered several potential confounding factors in our analysis, including gaseous air pollutants and socio-economical and meteorological conditions Our results underscore two policy implications - first, regulatory standards need to be better guided by exploring the concentration-response relationships near the lower end of the PM2 5 air quality distribution;and second, pollution regulations need to be continually enforced for combustion emissions that largely determine secondary inorganic aerosol formation","output":"Ambient PM2.5 exposure and rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Adults are at risk for illness, hospitalization, disability and, in some cases, death from vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly influenza and pneumococcal disease. CDC recommends vaccinations for adults on the basis of age, health conditions, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults remains low. REPORTING PERIOD: August 2017CJune 2018 (for influenza vaccination) and JanuaryCDecember 2018 (for pneumococcal, herpes zoster, tetanus and diphtheria [Td]/tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination). DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. NHISs objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. Adult receipt of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, Td/Tdap, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and at least 1 dose of HPV vaccines was assessed. Estimates were derived for a new composite adult vaccination quality measure and by selected demographic and access-to-care characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, indication for vaccination, travel history [travel to countries where hepatitis infections are endemic], health insurance status, contacts with physicians, nativity, and citizenship). Trends in adult vaccination were assessed during 2010?2018. RESULTS: Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measure was low in all age groups. Racial and ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all vaccinations, with lower coverage for most vaccinations among non-White compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Linear trend tests indicated coverage increased from 2010 to 2018 for most vaccines in this report. Few adults aged 19 years had received all age-appropriate vaccines, including influenza vaccination, regardless of whether inclusion of Tdap (13.5%) or inclusion of any tetanus toxoidCcontaining vaccine (20.2%) receipt was measured. Coverage among adults for influenza vaccination during the 2017?18 season (46.1%) was similar to the estimate for the 2016?17 season (45.4%), and coverage for pneumococcal (adults aged 65 years [69.0%]), herpes zoster (adults aged 50 years and aged 60 years [24.1% and 34.5%, respectively]), tetanus (adults aged 19 years [62.9%]), Tdap (adults aged 19 years [31.2%]), hepatitis A (adults aged 19 years [11.9%]), and HPV (females aged 19C26 years [52.8%]) vaccination in 2018 were similar to the estimates for 2017. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged 19 years and health care personnel (HCP) aged 19 years increased 4.2 and 6.7 percentage points to 30.0% and 67.2%, respectively, from 2017. HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19C26 years increased 5.2 percentage points to 26.3% from the 2017 estimate. Overall, HPV vaccination coverage among females aged 19C26 years did not increase, but coverage among Hispanic females aged 19C26 years increased 10.8 percentage points to 49.6% from the 2017 estimate. Coverage for the following vaccines was lower among adults without health insurance compared with those with health insurance: influenza vaccine (among adults aged 19 years, 19C49 years, and 50C64 years), pneumococcal vaccine (among adults aged 19C64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (among all age groups), Tdap vaccine (among adults aged 19 years and 19C64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (among adults aged 19 years overall and among travelers aged 19 years), hepatitis B vaccine (among adults aged 19 years and 19C49 years and among travelers aged 19 years), herpes zoster vaccine (among adults aged 60 years), and HPV vaccine (among males and females aged 19C26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting 1 physician contact during the preceding year compared with those who had not visited a physician during the preceding year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and 10 physician contacts during the preceding year, depending on the vaccine, 20.1%C87.5% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was significantly higher than that of foreign-born adults, including influenza vaccination (aged 19 years), pneumococcal vaccination (all ages), tetanus vaccination (all ages), Tdap vaccination (all ages), hepatitis B vaccination (aged 19 years and 19C49 years and travelers aged 19 years), herpes zoster vaccination (all ages), and HPV vaccination among females aged 19C26 years. Vaccination coverage also varied by citizenship status and years living in the United States. INTERPRETATION: NHIS data indicate that many adults remain unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measures was low in all age groups. Individual adult vaccination coverage remained low as well, but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for hepatitis B (among adults aged 19 years and HCP aged 19 years), and HPV (among males aged 19C26 years and Hispanic females aged 19C26 years). Coverage for other vaccines and groups with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccination indications did not improve from 2017. Although HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19C26 years and Hispanic females aged 19C26 years increased, approximately 50% of females aged 19C26 years and 70% of males aged 19C26 years remained unvaccinated. Racial/ethnic vaccination differences persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Having health insurance coverage, having a usual place for health care, and having 1 physician contacts during the preceding 12 months were associated with higher vaccination coverage; however, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage, and findings indicate missed opportunities to vaccinate remained. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Substantial improvement in adult vaccination uptake is needed to reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Following the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-practice/standards/index.html), all providers should routinely assess adults vaccination status at every clinical encounter, strongly recommend appropriate vaccines, either offer needed vaccines or refer their patients to another provider who can administer the needed vaccines, and document vaccinations received by their patients in an immunization information system.","output":"Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage Among Adult Populations United States, 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 has caused unprecedented public health concerns, triggering an escalated burden to health systems worldwide. The pandemic has altered people's living norms, yet coherently escalating countries' socioeconomic instability. This real-time consensus review aims to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic across six South-East Asian nations, and countryspecific experiences on pandemic preparedness, responses and interventions. METHODS Consensus-driven approach between authors from the six selected countries was applied. Country specific policy documents, official government media statements, mainstream news portals, global statistics databases and latest published literature available between January-October 2020 were utilised for information retrieval. Situational and epidemiological trend analyses were conducted. Country-specific interventions and challenges were described. Based on evidence appraised, a descriptive framework was considered through a consensus. The authors subsequently outlined the lessons learned, challenges ahead and interventions that needs to be in place to control the pandemic. RESULTS The total number of people infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 16 November 2020 had reached 48,520 in Malaysia, 58,124 in Singapore, 3,875 in Thailand, 470,648 in Indonesia, 409,574 in Philippines and 70,161 in Myanmar. The total number of people infected with COVID- 19 in the six countries from January to 31 October 2020 were 936,866 cases and the mortality rate was 2.42%. Indonesia had 410,088 cases with a mortality rate of 3.38%, Philippines had 380,729 cases with a mortality rate of 1.90%, Myanmar had 52,706 cases with a mortality rate of 2.34%, Thailand had 3,780 cases with a mortality rate of 1.56%, Malaysia had 31,548 cases with a mortality rate of 0.79%, and Singapore had 58,015 cases with a mortality rate of 0.05% over the 10- month period. Each country response varied depending on its real-time situations based on the number of active cases and economic situation of the country. CONCLUSION The number of COVID-19 cases in these countries waxed and waned over the 10-month period, the number of cases may be coming down in one country, and vice versa in another. Each country, if acting alone, will not be able to control this pandemic. Sharing of information and resources across nations is the key to successful control of the pandemic. There is a need to reflect on how the pandemic affects individuals, families and the community as a whole. There are many people who cannot afford to be isolated from their families and daily wage workers who cannot afford to miss work.

Are there any other avenues which can curb the epidemic while reducing its impact on the health and socio-economic condition of the individual, community and the nation?","output":"Battling COVID-19 pandemic waves in six South-East Asian countries: A real-time consensus review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A pandemic afflicts the entire world. The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy's potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES: COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS: All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION: This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. Larger studies are likely to define the role of HBOT in the treatment of this novel disease.","output":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in preventing mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic since December 2019.

METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using in-depth interviews with the participants in English. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and inductive coding followed by thematic analysis was performed using NVivo version 12. PARTICIPANTS: Six participants in charge of managing their respective primary health care settings were included in the study. Purposive sampling was used to identify participants until saturation was reached. After agreement, the interviews were scheduled as per availability. RESULTS: The results were grouped into three major themes and nine subthemes. Most leaders reported that they were trained in pandemic preparedness, but there was a lack of focused readiness to handle a massive-scale, infectious disease outbreak or pandemic. The initial lack of guidelines specific to COVID-19 was a barrier in making decisions related to staff and patient care. Services were interrupted initially and there was lack of staff since many acquired COVID-19 and were isolated. The shortage of the staff was delt by repurposing staff from other departments to the essential care services. Fears related to pandemic was one of the main concerns reported among staff and patients. Several initiatives were taken to ensure staff safety and uninterrupted service delivery to patients. The use of technology was an effective mechanism in preparing for the pandemic.

Patients who require prolonged isolation until recovery, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, present multiple therapeutic dilemmas to their caregivers. Therefore, utilizing remote care in the daily workflow would be a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic ocular conditions in this challenging clinical setting. Our aim is to review the latest technological and methodical advances in teleophthalmology and highlight their implementation in screening and managing various ocular conditions. We present them as well as potential diagnostic and treatment applications in view of the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak. METHODS: A computerized search from January 2017 up to March 2020 of the online electronic database PubMed was performed, using the following search strings: telemedicine, telehealth, and ophthalmology. More generalized complementary contemporary research data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was also obtained from the PubMed database. RESULTS: A total of 312 records, including COVID-19-focused studies, were initially identified. After exclusion of non-relevant, non-English, and duplicate studies, a total of 138 records were found eligible. Ninety records were included in the final qualitative analysis. CONCLUSION: Teleophthalmology is an effective screening and management tool for a range of adult and pediatric acute and chronic ocular conditions. It is mostly utilized in screening of retinal conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration; in diagnosing anterior segment condition; and in managing glaucoma.

METHODS: For this 2019-2020 pilot project, the resident physician authors first created and administered a simple five-item questionnaire screening process to systematically identify food insecure patients in their metropolitan Detroit residency clinic. A sample of patients who had been identified as food insecure and pre-diabetic were then provided improved access to healthy foods, supplemented by a six-week program of nutritional education classes using a nationally recognized Cooking Matters six-week long curriculum with a licensed chef and nutrition educator RESULTS: After institutional review board approval, the authors enrolled a sample of 10 adults. The authors successfully measured both pre- and post-program Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels for all participants who completed the required course and subsequent clinic follow up visits. Using a series of initial non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank matched pair tests, post-program follow-up at three months revealed statistically significant reductions in documented HbA1c levels from baseline for six enrolled patients (W=1, Z = - 2.226, p = 0.026) and six-month follow up (i.e., more than four months after completion of the program) (W = 1, Z = - 2.060, p = 0.039). In post-program surveys, each respondent indicated that they found the class content to be generally beneficial to increase their nutritional knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors setting, this food insecurity program has subsequently led to a more formal screening process to evaluate and identify food insecure patients. The authors discuss the scheduling difficulties they experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic for their sample patients. However, these pilot results suggest that prolonged benefits may require ongoing virtual teaching sessions with pre-diabetic patients to address the complex factors influencing food insecurity levels identified in similar inner-city settings.","output":"Evaluation of a COVID-influenced Curriculum to Address Food Insecurity in a Detroit Family Medicine Residency Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The background of this study is the problem of education in pandemic of Covid 19 where the students should study from home The students are tended to extra learn and they are asked to understand and comprehend the material deeply by themselves One of learning approach that can solve their problem is by implementing constructivism approach, especially in physics learning This study aims to analyze previous studies related to implementing constructivism approach in improving students critical thinking ability and to obtain sources to develop physics learning module about constructivism approach for grade VIII This research method is a meta-analysis with a sample of 10 articles in national and international journals The data collection is done by collecting and classifying similar scientific articles and then analyzing them The result of study shows that there are 8 out of articles used experimental research, and others used field research and classroom action research Furthermore, there are 40% of articles show the effectiveness of constructivist approach to improve students critical thinking ability in physics learning such as students can express their ideas by discussing with others students, they can make a conclusion after doing experiment activity, and they train to express their mind by debating In conclusion, constructivism approach can improve students critical thinking ability and it is needed developing beneficial physics module to get more improvement and to be a source in physics learning","output":"Implementation of constructivism approach in physics learning on students critical thinking ability of junior high school students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current SARS-COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the dangers that airborne virus (AV) pandemics pose to the health of all workers (particularly in the meat processing industry), the economic health of the food industry, and food security.

Previous studies showed positive results on accuracy, effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility, but also found some ineffective implementations. In this paper, we assessed the effect of implementation of EMMs on treatment outcomes. METHODS: The longitudinal ecological method was used at the county level with aggregate secondary programmatic data. All the notified TB cases in 138 counties were involved in this study from April 2017 to June 2019, and rifampicin-resistant cases were excluded. We fitted a multilevel model to assess the relative change in the quarterly treatment success rate with increasing quarterly EMM coverage rate, in which a mixed effects maximum likelihood regression using random intercept model was applied, by adjusting for seasonal trends, population size, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and clustering within counties. RESULTS: Among all 69 678 notified TB cases, the treatment success rate was slightly increased from 93.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 93.0C94.0] in second quarter of 2018 to 94.9% (95% CI: 94.4C95.4) in second quarter of 2019 after implementing EMMs. There was a statistically significant effect between quarterly EMM coverage and treatment success rate after adjusting for potential confounders (P = 0.0036), increasing 10% of EMM coverage rate will lead to 0.2% treatment success rate augment. Besides, an increase of 10% of elderly or bacteriologically confirmed TB will lead to a decrease of 0.4% and 0.9% of the treatment success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Under programmatic settings, we found a statistically significant effect between increasing coverage of EMM and treatment success rate at the county level. More prospective studies are needed to confirm the effect of using EMM on TB treatment outcomes. We suggest performing operational research on EMMs that provides real-time data under programmatic conditions in the future.

Scientific indications revealed the effect of biflavonoids (BFs) against respiratory syndrome viruses. The functional importance of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in forming viral RNA raises its potential to be targeted in SARS-CoV2. This study is devoted to the computational analysis of privileged BFs within the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro active site. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were collectively used to explore the most probable binding modes and stable ligandCenzyme chemical interactions. Despite the structural resemblance, a wide range of binding affinities was retrieved for BFs (Gb?7.11?12.66kcal/mol). Garciniaflavone C (Gb?12.66kcal/mol), 7,7, 4-tri-O-methylagathisflavone (Gb?12.16kcal/mol) and 8,8-biapigenil (Gb?12.08kcal/mol) were top enzyme binders. The stability of acquired complexes was analyzed through 50-ns all-atom MD simulations. Garciniaflavone C, 7,7, 4-tri-O-methylagathisflavone and 8,8-biapigenil showed 29%, 22% and 23% persevered binding residues, respectively. SARS-CoV2-garciniaflavone C complex was mediated by several nonpolar interactions. MD simulations assigned H-bond interaction between the catalytic dyad residue Cys145 and garciniaflavone C. 7,7, 4-tri-O-methylagathisflavone participated in a -cation interaction to His41. Solvent accessible surface area distribution indicated the sufficiency of MD simulation time (50ns) to screen equilibrated complex systems. Although a detailed pharmacological mechanism is to be elucidated, our findings indicated superior binding stability of 7,7, 4-tri-O-methylagathisflavone within SARS-CoV2 active site.

Public health mitigation solutions ranging from isolation of infected or suspected cases to implementation of national lockdowns have proven their effectiveness for the outbreaks control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review to identify healthcare systems interventions, experiences and recommendations that have been used to manage different respiratory viral infections outbreaks in the past. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until 17 April 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. When applicable, quality assessment was conducted for the included articles. We performed a narrative synthesis of each implemented public health approaches. RESULTS: We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health approaches implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks for COVID-19, influenza A H1N1, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome. The identified approaches are ascribable to two main categories: healthcare system strategies and healthcare provider interventions. The key components of an effective response on respiratory viral outbreaks included the implementation of evidence-based contextual policies, intrahospital management actions, community healthcare facilities, non-pharmaceutical interventions, enhanced surveillance, workplace preventive measures, mental health interventions and communication plans. CONCLUSION: The identified healthcare system strategies applied worldwide to face epidemics or pandemics are a useful knowledge base to inform decision-makers about control measures to be used in the transition phases of COVID-19 and beyond.","output":"How health systems approached respiratory viral pandemics over time: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 79-year-old Final Diagnosis: Cervical spinal epidural hematoma Symptoms: Neck pain ? unilateral weakness Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Neurosurgery ? Orthopedics and Traumatology OBJECTIVE: Rare disease BACKGROUND: This report presents the case of a woman with no known coagulopathy, use of anticoagulants, or history of trauma who spontaneously developed an epidural hematoma of the spine. This is an uncommon condition, with the potential for missed diagnosis and potential harm to the patient. CASE REPORT: The patient was an elderly woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Of note, she had recently recovered from COVID-19. Because the woman presented with right-sided weakness and pain in the back of her neck, the stroke team was activated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her neck revealed a very subtle hyperdensity, which on further investigation was found to be an acute epidural hematoma at C2CC3 space through the C6 vertebra. While awaiting surgery, the patient had spontaneous improvement of her right-sided weakness and her condition eventually was managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is an uncommon condition, and a high index of suspicion is required to accurately diagnose and appropriately manage it. In the case presented here, the hematoma was subtle on the CT scan, and the patients weakness easily could have been misdiagnosed as an ischemic stroke. That may have resulted in administration of thrombolytics, potentially causing significant harm. In addition, the patient had recently recovered from COVID-19 disease, which may or may not be incidental.

Damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are normal intracellular components or metabolites that, when released from cells, signal cellular damage/lysis. Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress. Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development. Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP, adenosine, and cyclic AMP exposure, at 0 and 14 hours post infection, on C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E development. In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity. Because chlamydial infection and other infections may increase local DAMP concentrations, DAMPs may influence Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections.","output":"Damage/Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) Modulate Chlamydia pecorum and C. trachomatis Serovar E Inclusion Development In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Complex immune dysregulation in interferon (IFN) and T cell response has been observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-infected patients as well as in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)/HIV-1 coinfection has been described in only few cases worldwide and no data are available on immunological outcomes in HIV-1-patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, this study aims to compare type I IFN response and T cell activation levels between a SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient and age-matched HIV-1-positive or uninfected women. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old woman diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1 coinfection, ten HIV-1-positive women and five age-matched-healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. DIAGNOSES: SARS-CoV-2 infection caused severe pneumonia in the second week of illness in HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors. Chest high-resolution computed tomography images of the SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected patient showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. INTERVENTIONS: SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient under darunavir/cobicistat regimen received a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. Analysis of IFN/ mRNA levels and CD4 and CD8 T cell (CD38, human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DR], CD38 HLA-DR) frequencies were performed by RT/real-time PCR assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Median relative difference (MRD) was calculated for each immunological variable. For values greater than reference, MRD should be a positive number and for values that are smaller, MRD should be negative. OUTCOMES: The severe pneumonia observed in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors was reversed by a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. At the end of treatment, on day 7, patient reported resolution of fever, normalization of respiratory rate (14 breaths/min), and improved oxygen arterial pressure with a F(i)O(2) of 30%. MRD values for IFN/ and CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CD38 and/or HLA-DR found in SARS-CoV-2-/HIV-1-coinfected woman were approximatively equal to 0 when refereed respectively to HIV-1-positive female patients [MRDs IFN/: median ?0.2545 (range: ?0.5/0.1); T cells: median ?0.11 (range: ?0.8/1.3)] and  6 when referred to healthy individuals [MRDs IFN/: median 28.45 (range: 15/41.9); T cells: median 10 (range 6/22)].

Consider the findings in relation to gender balance of dental and specialist registrants. Method Gender, presentation length and professional role were extracted from conference programmes. Acceptable gender balance was pre-specified as 40-60%. Gender data were extracted from the GDC registration report. Results Of 352 invited speakers, 39.8% (n = 140) were identified as female and 60.2% (n = 212) as male. Gender was acceptably balanced in 21.4% (n = 3) of conferences. Gender balance of specialist speakers varied, as does gender distribution within the specialties themselves. Only 38.5% (n = 5) of specialties had a specialist speaker gender balance representative of their speciality. Conclusion There is a call for further research to drive equity in the characteristics of invited speakers and to determine whether there is correlation with representation in the composition of conference organising committees, leadership, professional roles and the workforce.

Average annual tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates among the Guarani-Kaiow are nearly 400/100,000 in Mato Grosso do Sul state, ten times the national average. Although stigma is considered crucial for TB control in indigenous communities, few studies have investigated TB stigma among indigenous populations. This study sought to understand the role of TB-related stigma and perceptions of TB in maintaining hyperendemic TB transmission in the Guarani-Kaiow communities. METHODS: Various forms of stigma were explored through semi-structured interviews with 19 patients, 11 relatives, and 23 community members. Patients were identified from the registry of the healthcare service. Community members, selected by snowball sampling, were matched by gender and village of residence. Interviews were conducted in Guarani and Portuguese and later translated into English. Framework analysis was performed using NVivo. RESULTS: Traditional beliefs of a weakening of the body allowing the disease to enter were common, but the exact mechanism of transmission was unknown. Strong community/public stigma associated TB with uncleanliness, abuse, and irresponsibility. Anticipated stigma led to significant treatment delays for fear of exclusion and losing employment. While most patients felt supported by their families, nearly all patients related experienced/enacted stigma in the community such as gossip, avoidance, and social exclusion, leading to long-lasting internalized/self-stigma. Secondary stigmatization of relatives was widespread, and blanket latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment of patients households was a contributing factor in treatment delay. The healthcare service unnecessarily added to stigmatization by enforcing separate utensils and sleeping arrangements for patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that stigma is a driver for treatment delay and continued transmission of TB in the community. The stigmatization of TB was rooted in a poor understanding of TB transmission, partly because of incorrect orientation by the healthcare service. Interventions to reduce TB-associated stigma are urgently needed.","output":"The contribution of stigma to the transmission and treatment of tuberculosis in a hyperendemic indigenous population in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables, could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to detailed epidemic modelling.

We compared the characteristics and outcomes of children 0-59 months of age who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza or RSV between 2009 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. METHODS We included hospitalized children who were tested for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, and were positive for a single virus. We characterized individuals by their demographics and healthcare utilization patterns, and compared their hospital outcomes, in-hospital cost, and post-discharge healthcare use by virus type and by presence of underlying comorbidities. RESULTS We identified and analyzed 7,659 hospitalizations during which a specimen tested positive for influenza or RSV. Children with RSV were the youngest whereas children with influenza B were the oldest (median ages 6 months [interquartile range {IQR}: 2-17 months] and 25 months [IQR: 10-45 months], respectively). Complex chronic conditions were more prevalent among children with all influenza (sub)types than RSV (31%-34% vs 20%). In-hospital outcomes were similar by virus type, but in children with comorbidities, post-discharge outcomes varied. We observed no differences in in-hospital cost between viruses or by presence of comorbidities (overall median cost: $4,150 CAD [IQR: $3,710-$4,948]). CONCLUSION Influenza and RSV account for large numbers of pediatric hospitalizations. RSV and influenza were similar in terms of severity and cost in hospitalized children.

Inter-annotator variability was assessed by (1) comparing the number of times ophthalmologists delineated each layer in the dataset; (2) quantifying how the consensus area for each layer (i.e., the intersection area of observers delineations) varied with the consensus threshold; and (3) calculating agreement among annotators using average per-layer precision, sensitivity, and Dice score. RESULTS: The SS showed the largest difference in annotation frequency (31%) and the minimum overall agreement in terms of consensus size (28% of the labeled pixels). The average annotator's per-layer statistics showed consistent patterns, with lower agreement on the CBB and SS (average Dice score ranges of 0.61C0.7 and 0.73C0.78, respectively) and better agreement on the IR, TM, and C (average Dice score ranges of 0.97C0.98, 0.84C0.9, and 0.93C0.96, respectively).

More than a year after the COVID-19 lockdown period, the mental health problems of elite athletes (particularly the symptoms of depression and fatigue) are even greater concern than in June 2020, despite the recovery in training conditions and competition. Of all of the subjects, 80% had high levels of distress in 2021 compared to 36% in 2020. According to the athletes, the availability of health care services was good (78.6%), but there was a lack of close cooperation with the coach. However, the athletes considered their coaches to be their main supporters, along with their family members and partners. Only 4.3% of the respondents considered a sports psychologist to be their main supporter (n = 6). Conclusions: More than a year after the COVID-19 lockdown period, the mental health indicators of Estonian elite athletes were worrisome. Most of subjects had high levels of distress even though their training conditions had returned to normal (i.e., to as they had been before COVID-19).","output":"Changes in the Mental Health Indicators and Training Opportunities for Estonian Elite Athletes Compared to the COVID-19 Isolation Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral diseases remain serious threats to public health because of the shortage of effective means of control. To combat the surge of viral diseases, new treatments are urgently needed. Here we show that small-molecules, which inhibit cellular anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2i), induced the premature death of cells infected with different RNA or DNA viruses, whereas, at the same concentrations, no toxicity was observed in mock-infected cells. Moreover, these compounds limited viral replication and spread. Surprisingly, Bcl-2i also induced the premature apoptosis of cells transfected with viral RNA or plasmid DNA but not of mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2i sensitizes cells containing foreign RNA or DNA to apoptosis. A comparison of the toxicity, antiviral activity, and side effects of six Bcl-2i allowed us to select A-1155463 as an antiviral lead candidate.

Preventing hospitalisation, death and long-COVID-19 with repurposed drugs remains a priority. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are the most commonly used in ambulatory care, with divergent results. With the aim of decentralizing early treatment to family practitioners, we addressed the question: Can early home treatment with AZM alone or with zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19? Methodology We conducted a scoping review of articles published from 31st December 2019 to 5th November 2020 in Pubmed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv databases, and a review of undergoing clinical trials published in the Clinicaltrial.gov database. Results Many studies report on outpatient treatment with a combination of AZM + HCQ versus AZM alone, and few studies propose the addition of Zinc (Zn) to AZM. In addition, we identified 5 clinical trials currently recruiting individuals for early outpatient treatment with AZM. However, we failed in identifying any study or clinical trial conducted with family practitioners responding to our question. Discussion The antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory benefits of AZM + Zn make this drugs combination a good candidate therapy to treat flu-like-COVID-19 and atypical pneumoniae. The antibacterial action of AZM can also help disrupting the bacteria/virus cooperation that is poorly documented. Considering pros and cons of macrolide use (including antimicrobial resistance), we call for early use of this therapy by family practitioners for home treatment of individuals presenting mild or moderate symptoms under rigorous scientific guidance to prevent hospitalisation, death and long-COVID.","output":"COVID-19: Can early home treatment with Azithromycin alone or with Zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19?

One aspect of the pandemic is its effect on Educational systems. Educators have had to shift to a pure online based system. This shift has been sudden and without any prior warning. Despite this the Educational system has survived and exhibited resilience. The resilience of a system can be determined if the system continues to operate or function as effectively as before a change. Resilience in a system implies the ability to work and develop when the forces in the environment are unexpected, abrupt and sudden as well. The environment may change or evolve but the underlying system must keep functioning, developing and responding. Resilience is a trait in a system. It is a set of characteristics in the system that enables it to sustain itself in the face of change. A resilient system can cope and prosper in the face of change. For the domain of education, the Covid-19 pandemic served as a phenomenal change event and a wakeup call to the education fraternity. As a social system, resilience meant that the people in the educational environment continued to function albeit differently. The environment, meaning the processes, hierarchy and the intricate social ties in the system contributed to the resiliency of the system. Thus the measure of resilience in education has three major facetspeople, the technology which facilitates the process and the process environment. This work aims to understand the resilience of the teachers due to the Covid-19 pandemic, especially how learning continued and what contributed to this continuity. Resilience research and understanding is as important as the pedagogical and technological aspects in an Educational system as it is a trait that encompasses the people, the socio-economic system and their relationships. In this work, we analyzed resilience as trait, its relevance in an Educational system, factors that make up resilience in an Educational system and finally the relevant research about resilience in Education during Covid-19. Based on the results of our literature review we formed a model for Educators. A survey was conducted among educators of three countries namely Malaysia, Fiji, and India to determine the essential elements of resilience that were relevant to the continuity of an educational system from the point of view of teachers. We arrived at a set of factors that are relevant to the teachers in the educational systems which can be an impetus for policy makers to focus on and develop. The major results from the study are the need for Educational systems to focus on three facetsinternal, interpersonal and external aspects of teachers and strengthen factors such as support for teachers, strong academic leadership, trust of teachers, increase self-motivation, enhance communication with stakeholders and emphasize systems that enhance student-teacher communication.

Detecting COVID-19 from radiography images using computational medical imaging method is one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. However, early detection with significant results is a major challenge, given the limited available medical imaging data and conflicting performance metrics.

Primary outcomes were weight loss and improvement in comorbidities. For weight loss, percent of total body weight loss (%TWL) and percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) were included. Comorbidities included were hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), cardiovascular risk (CV) and hypertension. RESULTS 266 Secondary bariatric procedures were analyzed. There were four Grade IIIb complications within 30 days. There was greater %EBMIL at 12 and 24 months in the AGB to RYGB group, and in %TWL at 24 months compared to AGB to SG group (p < 0.05). Only AGB to RYGB had significantly continued improvement in these two parameters at 24 months compared to at 6 months post-operatively-%EBMIL and %TWL tapered off in the other procedures. There was significantly lower CV risk in dyslipidemic patients at 24 months in the AGB to RYGB compared to the AGB to SG group. In the SG to RYGB patients, there was significant improvement in CV risk in dyslipidemic patients at 24 months compared to baseline. There was significant improvement in HbA1C in diabetics in AGB to RYGB patients at 6 and 12 months, in AGB to SG patients at 12 months, and in SG to RYGB patients at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline. In RYGB revision and SG to RYGB patients, there was a relative increase in the number of patients being normotensive at 24 months compared to baseline.

Furthermore, some inequalities have widened and become more apparent, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. With growing recognition of the uneven distribution of life expectancy and of mental and physical health, the current research was commissioned to identify future research priorities to address UK societal and structural health inequalities. Methods: : An expert opinion consultancy process comprising an anonymous online survey and a consultation workshop were carried out to investigate priority areas for future research into UK inequalities. The seven-question survey asked respondents (n=170) to indicate their current role, then identify and prioritise areas of inequality, approaches and evaluation methods. The workshop was held to determine areas of research priority and attended by a closed list of delegates (n=30) representing a range of academic disciplines and end-users of research from policy and practice. Delegates self-selected one of four breakout groups, to participate in determining research priority areas in four categories of inequality (health, social, economic, and other) and to allocate hypothetical sums of funding (half, one, five, and ten million pounds) to chosen priority areas. Responses were analysed using mixed methods. Results: : Survey respondents determined the main areas of inequality as health, social care, living standards, and economic factors. The highest research priorities were access to creative and cultural opportunities, sense of place and community. Approaches seen to benefit from more research were health/social care, advice services and adult education/training. Preferred evaluation methods were community/participatory, action research, questionnaires/focus groups and ethnographic studies. The key workshop finding was that health equity could only be achieved by tackling societal and structural inequalities, environmental conditions and housing, and having an active prevention programme. Conclusions: : Research demonstrates a clear need to assess the impact of cultural and natural assets in reducing inequality. Collaborations between community groups, service providers, local authorities, health commissioners, GPs and researchers using longitudinal approaches are needed within a multi-disciplinary approach to address societal and structural health inequalities.","output":"The Role of Cultural, Community and Natural Assets in Addressing Societal and Structural Health Inequalities in the UK: Future Research Priorities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose the Echo-Chamber Effect assessment of an online forum.

Among the various systems, Zoom is the most widely deployed video conference system. In October 2020, Zoom Video Communications rolled out their end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect conversations in a meeting from even insiders, namely, the service provider Zoom. In this study, we conduct thorough security evaluations of the E2EE of Zoom (version 2.3.1) by analyzing their cryptographic protocols. We discover several attacks more powerful than those expected by Zoom according to their whitepaper. Specifically, if insiders collude with meeting participants, they can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings, whereas Zoom indicates that they can impersonate only the current meeting participants. Besides, even without relying on malicious participants, insiders can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings though they cannot decrypt meeting streams. In addition, we demonstrate several impersonation attacks by meeting participants or insiders colluding with meeting participants. Although these attacks may be beyond the scope of the security claims made by Zoom or may be already mentioned in the whitepaper, we reveal the details of the attack procedures and their feasibility in the real-world setting and propose effective countermeasures in this paper.

Methods: A retrospective review of 121 infants who underwent initial arch reconstruction of the proximal and distal aortic arches between 2010 and 2020 was performed. Freedom from recoarctation was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine perioperative data associated with an increased risk of recoarctation after surgery. Results: Aortic arch reconstruction was performed by end-to-side anastomosis (ESA) (n=37) or patch repair [autologous pericardial patch (APP), n=53; bovine pericardial patch (BPP), n=20; autologous pulmonary artery patch (APAP), n=11].

There are several qRT-PCR assays with little evidence on their comparability. We report alterations to the developers' recommendations to sustain the testing capability in our setting, where the supply of testing reagents is limited. Methods: Standards generated from a serially-diluted positive control and previously identified positive/negative samples were used to determine the optimal volumes of the qRT-PCR reagents and to evaluate the validity and performance of four assays: Charit Berlin and European Virus Archive - GLOBAL (EVAg) primer-probe sets, and DAAN and Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) premixed commercial kits. A multiplex and singleplex RT-PCR kit was used with the two primer-probe sets and the recommended assay volumes of the two premixed kits were altered. Results: In comparison to the multiplex RT-PCR kit, the singleplex RT-PCR kit combined with the primer-probe sets yielded consistent cycle threshold (Ct) values across the different titrations tested. The DAAN premixed kit produced comparable Ct values across the titrations, while the BGI kit showed incomparable Ct values and inconsistent results between batches using the manufacturer's recommended volumes. Conclusion: We achieved a 2.5-fold and 4-fold increase in the number of tests/kit for the premixed kits and the primer-probe sets, respectively.

One of the most common symptoms caused by COVID-19 are lung problems like pneumonia, which can be detected using X-ray images. On the other hand, the popularity of Machine Learning models has grown exponentially in recent years and Deep Learning techniques have become the state-of-the-art for image classification tasks and is widely used in the healthcare sector nowadays as support for clinical decisions. This research aims to build a prediction model based on Machine Learning, including Deep Learning, techniques to predict the mortality risk of a particular patient given an X-ray and some basic demographic data. Keeping this in mind, this paper has three goals. First, we use Deep Learning models to predict the mortality risk of a patient based on this patient X-ray images. For this purpose, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks as well as Transfer Learning techniques to mitigate the effect of the reduced amount of COVID19 data available. Second, we propose to combine the prediction of this Convolutional Neural Network with other patient data, like gender and age, as input features of a final Machine Learning model, that will act as second and final layer. This second model layer will aim to improve the goodness of fit and prediction power of our first layer. Finally, and in accordance with the principle of reproducible research, the data used for the experiments is publicly available and we make the implementations developed easily accessible via public repositories. Experiments over a real dataset of COVID-19 patients yield high AUROC values and show our two-layer framework to obtain better results than a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving close to perfect classification.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality Risk Prediction Using X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify factors affecting rumination time (RT), factorial analyses in a dairy farm were performed. In univariate analyses, differences in distribution were observed between low (< 45 kg/d) and high ( 45 kg/d) milk yield (MY) before the heat season, early and peak lactation periods and mid and late at the start of the heat season, and 1-2 and  3 parity at the start of the heat season. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that RT was affected by low MY, early to peak and 1-2 parity cows, low MY, mid to late and 1-2 parity cows, and low MY, early to peak and  3 parity cows (coefficients = ?37.039, ?25.353, ?44.805 respectively, P < 0.05). When the cows were classified by MY before the heat season, the RT and MY of the high-MY group remained higher than the low-MY group until before the severe heat (THI  84 continued). However, when cows were classified by RT before the heat season, there was no difference in MY between the low-RT (< 485 min/d) and the high-RT group (> 485 min/d).

Conversely, little is known about the clinical course of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: The Italian Society of Hospital Neurosciences (SNO) promoted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study (SNO-COVID-19), involving 20 Neurological Departments in Northern Italy. Clinical data on patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases, admitted from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, were collected. A comparison was made of the demographical and clinical features of both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients with ICH. RESULTS: 949 patients were enrolled (average age 73.4 years; 52.7% males); 135 patients had haemorrhagic stroke and 127 (13.4%) had a primary ICH. Only 16 patients with ICH (12.6%) had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia or respiratory distress (OR 5.4), lobar location (OR 5.0) and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (OR 2.9) were the only factors significantly associated with increased mortality in ICH. SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of respiratory involvement, led to a non-significantly increased risk of in-hospital death (37.5% vs 23.4%, p = 0.2). DISCUSSION: ICH patients with COVID-19 did not experience an increase in mortality as striking as ischemic stroke. The inflammatory response and respiratory complications could justify the slight increase of death in ICH. Bleeding sites and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment were the only other predictors of a worse outcome.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on acute intracerebral haemorrhage in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cold-stress hormones (CSHs) stimulate thermogenesis and have direct neuroprotective effects on the brain.

Analysis of 2,331,175 unique patients tested March-May 2020 demonstrated an increasing trend in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity across Black non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 7.8% to 17.2%, P < 0.0001) and Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 8.4% to 15.5%, P < 0.0001) and a decreasing trend across White non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 17.4% to 7.1%, P < 0.0001). These trends in viral ribonucleic acid positivity remained in stratified analyses and in multivariable models that controlled for known risk factors including sex, population density, and the states initially hardest hit by COVID-19. These findings indicate that communities with the highest proportions of Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations have the highest SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates, even after controlling for other risk factors.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the immunopathology of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to that of non-COVID-19 ARDS, and to identify biomarkers associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: Prospective observational monocenter study. Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020 were included and compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was mortality at day 28. Flow cytometry analyses and serum cytokines measurements were performed at days 1-2 and 4-6 of ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: As compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS (n=36), those with COVID-19 (n=38) were not significantly different regarding age, gender, and SOFA and SAPS II scores but exhibited a higher day-28 mortality (34% vs 11%, p=0.030). COVID-19 patients showed profound and sustained T CD4+ (p=0.002), CD8+ (p<0.0001) and B (p<0.0001) lymphopenia, higher HLA-DR expression on monocytes (p<0.001) and higher serum concentrations of EGF, GM-CSF, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1a, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES, and CCL20/MIP-3a. After adjusting on age and SOFA, serum CXCL10/IP-10 (p=0.047) and GM-CSF (p=0.050) were higher and naso-pharyngeal RT-PCR cycle threshold values lower (p=0.010) in COVID-19 patients who were dead at day-28.

Methods: : The sample size was 2,004 individuals based on multistage sampling during the pre-investigation. Based on the results of the pre-investigation, the formal investigation expanded the sample size to 57,012 individuals. A single throat swab was collected from each individual for nucleic acid testing (NAT) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NAT was performed by a third-party institution, BGI. We collected information related to demographics, disease history, travel history, and personal protective measures before home quarantine, and monitored close-contact histories using the We Chat questionnaire. Results: : The total infection rate of home-quarantined individuals was 0.11% (95% CI: 0.05%C0.24%) out of the total sample size of 59,016. The detection period for seven confirmed cases was primarily concentrated between February 8 and 18, 2020, which was during the second incubation period after Wuhan's closure. The home quarantined individuals with epidemic histories (came from Hubei and any other affected regions) were considered the high risk population during the first two incubations after Wuhans closure. No positive cases were detected from February 25 to present (the third incubation after Wuhans closure). The number of newly-confirmed cases per day was 0 for 8 days from February 22 to 29 in Shenzhen. Thus, the strategies of prevention and control were effective. Conclusions: : The strategies and policies were effective for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Additionally, the strategy of implementing NAT during the first two incubations for home-quarantined individuals with epidemic histories (came from Hubei and any other affected regions), but without symptoms, facilitated early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early quarantining, and early treatment.

Our gene targeting study revealed that ERAD involving Derlin2 and SEL1L, but not Derlin1, is required for the viral genome replication. Derlin2 predominantly localized in the convoluted membrane (CM) of viral replication organelle, and viral NS proteins degraded in the CM.

Although underappreciated, many gut anaerobes are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen (1), with oxygen available to bacteria growing at the mucus layer. Using a combination of analyses, we show that Bacteroides species are metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the presence of 0.10 - 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions (2). Taking advantage of this metabolic capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields high fluorescence intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to image dynamic Type VI secretion system processes in metabolically active B. fragilis. The ability to visualize fluorescently-labeled Bacteroides and fluorescently-linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut symbionts ushers in a new age of imaging analyses in these bacteria. Significance Despite many recent technological advances to study the human gut microbiota, we still lack a facile system to image dynamic cellular processes in most abundant gut species due to the requirement of oxygen for chromophore maturation of commonly used fluorescent proteins. Here, we took advantage of the ability of anaerobes of the gut microbiota to respire aerobically and grow robustly at 0.10C 0.14% oxygen. This physiologic concentration of oxygen is sufficient for fluorescent proteins to mature, allowing for visualization of biological processes never before imaged in these bacteria. This advance will allow for numerous types of analyses in actively-growing nanaerobic gut bacteria including subcellular protein localizations, single-cell analyses, biofilm imaging, and protein interactions with other microbes and the host.","output":"Nanaerobic growth enables direct visualization of dynamic cellular processes in human gut symbionts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020, a study of The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City was conducted to better understand the challenge of adapting idealized infection control design guides to site-specific conditions during a pandemic The study aimed to capture quick interventions that are working, offer a new hypothesis and framework to guide future design interventions, and share lessons to assist other medical facilities as they pursue their own necessary spatial adaptations moving forward Three units repurposed for COVID-19 were studied Using action cameras and cloud-based videoconferencing, clinicians helped designers remotely peer in real time to active COVID-19 units, create ?heatmap? annotations of perceived risk by frontline clinicians, and conduct interviews with decision makers The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems around the world to provide safe and effective care Leveraging spatial design, architecture, and design hacks offers an untapped opportunity to support infection prevention and improved team dynamics, ultimately improving the safety and the effectiveness of the health care team by creating an environment that supports infection prevention and team function","output":"Architecture Can Heal: Spatial Literacy to Protect COVID-19 Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio (Tdap-IPV) are not optimal among German adolescents. Education in combination with easy access to vaccination may be a promising approach to improve vaccination rates. The present paper describes a pilot study of a planned cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in which we aim to improve MMR and Tdap-IPV vaccination rates together with knowledge and self-efficacy in a school setting. METHODS: The study covered 863 students from 41 classes of four schools. The optimization and feasibility of access to schools, recruitment strategies, intervention, and assessment procedures were examined. The course and content of the educational unit were evaluated with a mixed-methods approach. A pre-post measurement design was tested for the vaccination rate in all schools. Additionally, at two schools, improvement in vaccination-related knowledge and perceived self-efficacy were measured by questionnaire pre-educational unit (n=287) and post-educational unit (n=293). The remaining two schools provided only postintervention data. Finally, we evaluated the psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, retest reliability, and change rates) of the questionnaire, applying Cronbachs alpha, factor analyses, generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models. RESULTS: The findings of the pilot study indicated good feasibility. Of the total sample, 437 students (50.9%) brought their vaccination cards to school, 68 students received Tdap-IPV vaccinations, and 11 received MMR vaccinations. Out of six knowledge questions, on average, the students had M=2.84 (95% CI [2.69, 3.10]) correct answers before and M=4.45 (95% CI [4.26, 4.64]) after the class. Ranging from 1 to 4, the self-efficacy scale changed by 0.3 points (p <.001); Cronbachs alpha was 0.67 and 0.76 pre- and post-educational unit, respectively, and a one-factor solution was found. Content analysis of the five semistructured group interviews (n=12, 58.3% female) showed that all students found the length of the intervention to be appropriate.

We compared healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 naive (n=20), to those infected during the first wave prior to the emergence of Beta (n=20), and those infected in the second wave (n=20), when Beta was the dominant variant. We demonstrate that a priming exposure from infection significantly increased the magnitude of spike binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity (ADCC) against D614G, Beta and Delta variants. The magnitude of antibody boosting was similar in both waves, despite the longer time interval between wave 1 infection and vaccination (7 months), compared to wave 2 (2 months). ADCC and binding cross-reactivity was similar in both waves. However, neutralization cross-reactivity varied by wave, showing that the antibody repertoire was shaped by the spike sequence of the infecting variant. Robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to spike of similar or higher magnitude as those elicited by infection were induced after vaccination. In contrast to antibody responses, prior infection was not required for the generation of high magnitude T cell responses, and T cell recognition of the Beta variant was fully preserved. Therefore, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination following prior infection, even >6 months previously, may result in substantially enhanced protection against COVID-19, of particular relevance in settings of high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.

Additionally, some colleges are testing wastewater on their campuses for signs of infection, which can provide an early warning signal for campuses to locate COVID-positive individuals. However, a representation of wastewater surveillance has not yet been incorporated into epidemiological models for college campuses, nor has the efficacy of wastewater screening been evaluated relative to traditional individual surveillance testing, within the structure of these models. Here, we implement a new model component for wastewater surveillance within an established epidemiological model for college campuses. We use a hypothetical residential university to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater surveillance for maintaining low infection rates. We find that wastewater sampling with a 1-day lag to initiate individual screening tests, plus completing the subsequent tests within a 4-day period can keep overall infections within 5% of the infection rates seen with traditional individual surveillance testing. Our results also indicate that wastewater surveillance can effectively reduce the number of false positive cases by identifying subpopulations for surveillance testing where infectious individuals are more likely to be found. Through a Monte Carlo risk analysis, we find that surveillance testing that relies solely on wastewater sampling can be fragile against scenarios with high viral reproductive numbers and high rates of infection of campus community members by outside sources. These results point to the practical importance of additional surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus on campus and the necessity of a proactive response to the initial signs of outbreak.","output":"Evaluating the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates on college campuses to wastewater surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery and minilaparoscopy (ML) represent the evolution of laparoscopy for the treatment of urologic diseases.

Median operative time was 147.3min (interquartile range [IQR]: 110-195min); (2) safety: no intraoperative complications were reported. Only in two patients (10%), a urinoma was postoperatively identified and conservatively treated with an ureteral stent. The median difference in post- and preoperative creatinine and haemoglobin was +0.55mg/dl and -0.76mg/dl (IQR: -0.20/-1.20mg/dl); (3) efficacy: the median postoperative hospital stay was 4.4 d (IQR: 4-9 d). The overall success rate was 95% at the follow-up; (4) cosmesis: all patients were enthusiastic with the appearance of the scars; the median body image score and the median cosmesis score were 19.95 (IQR 19-20) and 23.95 (IQR 23-24), respectively. The limitations of this study are the limited series and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our phase 2a studies demonstrate that MILESS-DP is a safe and reproducible procedure with excellent cosmetic outcomes and short-term clinical outcomes in the hands of a surgical team with experience in laparoscopy. PATIENT SUMMARY Minilaparoscopy using 3-mm instruments and laparoendoscopic single-site using a single abdominal incision, still present several technical drawbacks which limit their reproducibility in urology. In order to overcome these technical limitations and equally combining the advantages of both these surgical procedures, we ideated a hybrid technique which we defined minilaparoendoscopic single-site. This study aims to demonstrate that minilaparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty is a safe and reproducible procedure with excellent cosmetic outcomes and short-term clinical outcomes in the hands of a surgical team with experience in mini-invasive surgery.","output":"Minilaparoendoscopic Single-site Pyeloplasty: The Best Compromise Between Surgeon's Ergonomy and Patient's Cosmesis (IDEAL Phase 2a)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Population-level health and mortality data are crucial for evidence-informed policy but scarce in Nigeria. To fill this gap, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in Nigeria and compared outcomes to other west African countries. METHODS: In this systematic analysis, using data and results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, we analysed patterns of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), and health system coverage for Nigeria and 15 other west African countries by gender in 1998 and 2019. Estimates of all-age and age-standardised disability-adjusted life-years for 369 diseases and injuries and 87 risk factors are presented for Nigeria. Health expenditure per person and gross domestic product were extracted from the World Bank repository. FINDINGS: Between 1998 and 2019, life expectancy and HALE increased in Nigeria by 18% to 643 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 622C666), mortality reduced for all age groups for both male and female individuals, and health expenditure per person increased from the 11th to third highest in west Africa by 2018 (US$186 in 2001 to $8375 in 2018). Nonetheless, relative outcomes remained poor; Nigeria ranked sixth in west Africa for age-standardised mortality, seventh for HALE, tenth for YLLs, 12th for health system coverage, and 14th for YLDs in 2019. Malaria (51763 YLLs per 100 000 people, 95% UI 24640C95911) and neonatal disorders (48188 YLLs per 100 000, 38659C60642) were the leading causes of YLLs in Nigeria in 2019. Nigeria had the fourth-highest under-five mortality rate for male individuals (24918 deaths per 100 000, 95% UI 19861C31401) and female individuals (21177 deaths per 100 000, 17567C25691), but among the lowest mortality for men older than 55 years. There was evidence of a growing non-communicable disease burden facing older Nigerians. INTERPRETATION: Health outcomes remain poor in Nigeria despite higher expenditure since 2001. Better outcomes in countries with equivalent or lower health expenditure suggest health system strengthening and targeted intervention to address unsafe water sources, poor sanitation, malnutrition, and exposure to air pollution could substantially improve population health.

This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. RESULTS: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNF blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNF agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.","output":"Associations between immune-suppressive and stimulating drugs and novel COVID-19a systematic review of current evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kondisi pandemik COVID-19 telah mengakibatkan berbagai sektor mengalami guncangan khususnya berkaitan dengan kegiatan ekonomi.

Glycolytic metabolism has been identified as a determinant of susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, but its role in the development and maintenance of HIV-1 latency has not been elucidated. By combining transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis, we here show that transition to latent HIV-1 infection downregulates glycolysis, while viral reactivation by conventional stimuli reverts this effect. Decreased glycolytic output in latently infected cells is associated with downregulation of NAD+/NADH. Consequently, infected cells rely on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway and its main product, the antioxidant NADPH, fueling antioxidant pathways maintaining HIV-1 latency. Of note, blocking NADPH downstream effectors, thioredoxin and glutathione, favors HIV-1 reactivation from latency in lymphoid and myeloid cellular models. This provides a shock and kill effect decreasing proviral DNA in cells from people-living-with-HIV/AIDS. Overall, our data show that downmodulation of glycolysis is a metabolic signature of HIV-1 latency that can be exploited to target latently infected cells with eradication strategies.","output":"Glycolysis downregulation is a hallmark of HIV-1 latency and sensitizes infected cells to oxidative stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological sicknesses are serious, multifactorial, debilitating disorders that may cause neurodegeneration.

Various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy, afflict many people worldwide, with increasing age representing the leading risk factor. Crocin is a natural carotenoid compound which was found to have therapeutic potentials in the management of the neurological disease. In this review, we focused on the restorative capabilities of Crocin as a neuroprotective agent. The general neuroprotective impact and the various conceivable basic components identified with Crocin have been examined. In light of the substantial proof indicating the neuro-pharmacological viability of Crocin to different exploratory standards, it is concluded that Crocin exerts direct antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities by multiple signaling pathways. Besides, Crocin was found to elevate dopamine level in the brain during the experimental model of Parkinson's disease. Thus, this compound has been demonstrated to be a promising option for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, with few adverse effects.

Therefore, we employed a prospective, intensive longitudinal design to examine whether emergency-eligible call volume would lead to higher intensity negative emotions post-shift when controlling for pre-shift negative emotions and a number of other work and individual factors, including work duration and night shift. A total of 47 ERS telecommunicators (dispatchers, operators, other) completed ratings over working shifts within a two-week period. Call frequency was gathered through the agency Computer-Assisted Dispatch database. Negative emotions of irritation, stress, worry, and fatigue were measured through the Visual Analogue Scale administered before and after shift. Mixed linear modeling demonstrated that telecommunicators who received more calls per hour (Estimate = 3.56, SE = 1.44, p < 0.05) and more-than-usual calls per hour (Estimate = 1.97, SE = .94, p < 0.05) had higher levels of post-shift irritability. Longer-than-usual working hours also predicted higher levels of post-shift irritability (Estimate = 1.32, SE = 0.59, p < 0.05). Call volume did not predict other negative emotions, although secondary analyses demonstrated that a larger number of chronic calls lead to greater levels of post-shift worry.

As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety, and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multisystems disease that disturbs the whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but the reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity, and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualize how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate, and accommodate stress. Critical Issues: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multiorgan/multilevel interdependencies. Host/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven \\"oxidative storm\\" alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic, and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at the individual and population level. Future Directions: While inflicting considerable damage to health and well-being, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve the diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. \\"Redox phenotyping\\" of patients to characterize whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.","output":"COVID-19: A Redox Disease-What a Stress Pandemic Can Teach Us About Resilience and What We May Learn from the Reactive Species Interactome About Its Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic affecting virtually every country. As of August 31, 2020, globally, there have been approximately 25,500,000 confirmed cases and 850,000 deaths; in the United States (50 states plus District of Columbia), there have been more than 6,000,000 confirmed cases and 183,000 deaths. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to predict and monitor COVID-19 mortality across the United States. The model captures skewed unimodal (prolonged recovery) or multimodal (multiple surges) curves. The results show that across all states, the first peak dates of mortality varied between April 4, 2020 for Alaska and June 18, 2020 for Arkansas. As of August 31, 2020, 31 states had a clear bimodal curve showing a strong second surge. The peak date for a second surge ranged from July 1, 2020 for Virginia to September 12, 2020 for Hawaii. The first peak for the United States occurred about April 16, 2020dominated by New York and New Jerseyand a second peak on August 6, 2020dominated by California, Texas, and Florida. Reliable models for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic are essential to informing resource allocation and intervention strategies. A Bayesian mixture model was able to more accurately predict the shape of the mortality curves across the United States than other models, including the timing of multiple peaks. However, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is important that the results be updated regularly to identify and better monitor future waves, and characterize the epidemiology of the pandemic.","output":"A Bayesian Mixture Model for Predicting the COVID-19 Related Mortality in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus, which emerged in China towards the end of 2019 and subsequently influenced the whole world, has changed the daily lives of people to a great extent.

In this period, very few people, including essential workers, had to leave their homes. Avoiding social contact is proven to be the best method to reduce the spread of the novel Coronavirus. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, people are adapting their behavior to this new reality, and it may change the type of public events people perform and how people go to these activities.

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of patients  18 years of age and admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March and June 2020 in 13 Hospitals in New Jersey, United States. Patients who received other formulation of corticosteroids were not included. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves were performed to test for discriminatory ability of each inflammatory makers. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression assessed the association of variables to in hospital survival. RESULTS: Propensity matched sample (n = 759) between no methylprednisolone (n = 380) and methylprednisolone (n = 379) had 338 Whites, 102 Blacks, 61 Asian/Indians, and 251 non-Black non-White Hispanics. Compared to CRP, area under receiving operating characteristic curve for d-dimer in Hispanics (0.742) was statistically different (DeLong Test P = 0.0041). Multivariate cox regression showed that different variables in Blacks [age  60 years (HR = 3.71, P = 0.0281), mechanical ventilation (HR = 5.07, P = 0.0281) and creatinine  1.5 mg/dL (HR = 3.61, P = 0.0007)], Whites [cancer (HR = 1.68, P = 0.0213), qSOFA score of 1 (HR = 1.81, P = 0.0213), qSOFA score of 2 (HR = 5.16, P < 0.0001), qSOFA score of 3 (HR = 11.81, P < 0.0001) and creatinine  1.5 mg/dL (HR = 2.16, P = 0.0006)], Hispanics [hypertension (HR = 2.52, P = 0.0007), cancer (HR = 2.99, P = 0.0244 and D-dimer  2 mcg/mL (HR = 2.22, P = 0.0077)], and Asian/Indians [ chronic kidney disease (HR = 6.36, P = 0.0031) and CRP > 20 mg/L (HR = 5.02, P = 0.0032)] were statistically significant for mortality. Low dose and high dose methylprednisolone were significantly associated with prolonged survival in Whites [low dose (HR = 0.37, P < 0.0001) and high dose (HR = 0.48, P < 0.0183)] and Asian/Indians [low dose (HR = 0.13, P = 0.0101) and high dose (HR = 0.15, P = 0.01)]. However, high dose was not associated with improved survival compared to low dose. Methylprednisolone was not associated with prolonged survival in Blacks and Hispanics.

In April 2021, the authorities in Zambia administered the first doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca? COVID-19 vaccine. However, little is known about the awareness and acceptability of the vaccines among the Zambian population. This study was undertaken to address this starting with undergraduate pharmacy students in Zambia. Materials and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among 326 undergraduate pharmacy students in Zambia using an online semi-structured questionnaire from 12th to 25th April 2021 and analysed using Stata version 16. Test of associations were undertaken using Pearson chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the determinants of awareness and acceptability. All statistical tests were performed at a 5% significance level and 95% confidence level. Results: Among 326 participants, 98.8% were aware of the COVID-19 vaccination programme but only 24.5% would accept the vaccine should it be made available to them. Awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by religious beliefs (aOR=0.01, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.20, p=0.004). Being male (aOR=1.78, 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.02, p=0.034) and single (aOR=2.61, 95% CI: 1.04 to 6.55, p=0.041) was associated with higher odds of accepting the vaccine. Being unemployed (aOR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.66, p=0.002) was associated with lower odds of vaccine acceptancy. Barriers to acceptance of the vaccine were possible side effects (78.5%) and scepticism about its effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 (10.2%). Conclusion: There was significant vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines among Zambian pharmacy students despite their awareness about the vaccines. Health authorities must work collaboratively with the Universities and other institutions to mitigate vaccine hesitancy, especially with pharmacy students a key part of the future healthcare workforce overseeing disease prevention strategies.

As a tertiary cancer center in Southwest China, we formulated and implemented an anti-infection protocol to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 in our department. METHODS: The anti-infection protocol divided patients into 3 categories, namely outpatients, inpatients, and patients receiving radiation therapy at our cancer center, and each category had a distinct anti-infection protocol to minimize the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 transmission. In each category, the patients were classified into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. Each risk group was managed differently. A survey of patient volume changes prior to and during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak was performed. RESULTS: We carried out the anti-infection protocol at our cancer center during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. We found that the total volume of both outpatient visits and inpatient treatment declined significantly depending on the conditions of each group. Radiation therapy and palliative service had the lowest and highest volume reductions at 58.3% and 100%, respectively. The decline in outpatient volumes was higher than the decline in inpatient treatment services (78.8% vs 71.8%). There was no Coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection at our center, or Coronavirus disease 2019Crelated injury or death. The anti-infection protocol measures continue to be taken at the hospital even today but they have been modified depending on the prevalent local conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges from the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic remain in our community. The anti-infection protocol implemented at our cancer center has been effective in preventing cross-infection. Whether our anti-infection protocol experience can be applied to curb the spread of the infection in other parts of the world remains to be tested.","output":"Challenges for a Cancer Center in the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) correlates with increased virus transmissibility and disease severity in humans.

Herein, the interaction of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with the Sprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. CQD molecules were optimized by the HF/3-21G level of theory;the probable interactions between the CQDs with Sprotein were studied by blind docking mode, considering the Sprotein as the receptor and CQDs as ligands. Ethanol, folic acid, Favipiravir, two kinds of functionalized triangular hexagonal graphene, and four kinds of functionalized CQDs were studied on a comparative basis. The results show that OH and amine-functionalized CQDs tend to interact with three branches of Sprotein, especially RBD.

Two members of this family, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are indispensable, since SOCS1 knockout in mice results in neonatal death due to interferon gamma (IFN?3) induced inflammatory disease, and SOCS3 knockout leads to embryonic lethality. We have shown that SOCS1 and SOCS3 (SOCS1/3) function as virus induced intrinsic virulence factors for influenza A virus, EMC virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and vaccinia virus infections. Other viruses such as pathogenic pig enteric coronavirus and coronavirus induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein also induce SOCS virus intrinsic virulence factors. SOCS1/3 exert their viral virulence effect via inhibition of type I and type II interferon (IFN) function. Specifically, the SOCS bind to the activation loop of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2 through the SOCS kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits STAT transcription factor activation by the kinases. Activated STATs are required for IFN function. We have developed a small peptide antagonist of SOCS1/3 that blocks SOCS1/3 inhibitory activity and prevents virus pathogenesis. The antagonist, pJAK2(1001-1013), is comprised of the JAK2 activation loop, phosphorylated at tyrosine 1007 with a palmitate for cell penetration. The remarkable thing about SOCS1/3 is that it serves as a broad, simple tool of perhaps most pathogenic viruses to avoid innate host IFN defense. We suggest in this Perspective that SOCS1/3 antagonist is a simple counter measure to SOCS1/3 and should be an effective mechanism as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic against the COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2.","output":"SOCS, Intrinsic Virulence Factors, and Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data on the management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) amid concerns about the risk of transmission during endoscopic procedures. We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, 24 of 1342 (1.8%) patients with COVID-19, presenting with GI bleeding from 22nd April to 22nd July 2020, were included. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 45.8  12.7 years; 17 (70.8%) were males; upper GI (UGI) bleeding: lower GI (LGI) 23:1. Twenty-two (91.6%) patients had evidence of cirrhosis- 21 presented with UGI bleeding while one had bleeding from hemorrhoids. Two patients without cirrhosis were presumed to have non-variceal bleeding. The medical therapy for UGI bleeding included vasoconstrictors-somatostatin in 17 (73.9%) and terlipressin in 4 (17.4%) patients. All patients with UGI bleeding received proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) and platelets were transfused in 14 (60.9%), 3 (13.0%) and 3 (13.0%), respectively. The median PRBCs transfused was 1 (0C3) unit(s). The initial control of UGI bleeding was achieved in all 23 patients and none required an emergency endoscopy. At 5-day follow-up, none rebled or died. Two patients later rebled, one had intermittent bleed due to gastric antral vascular ectasia, while another had rebleed 19 days after discharge. Three (12.5%) cirrhosis patients succumbed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Conservative management strategies including pharmacotherapy, restrictive transfusion strategy, and close hemodynamic monitoring can successfully manage GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and reduce need for urgent endoscopy. The decision for proceeding with endoscopy should be taken by a multidisciplinary team after consideration of the patient's condition, response to treatment, resources and the risks involved, on a case to case basis.","output":"Outcome of Conservative Therapy in Coronavirus disease-2019 Patients Presenting With Gastrointestinal Bleeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Droplet microfluidics has become a powerful tool in precision medicine, green biotechnology, and cell therapy for single-cell analysis and selection by virtue of its ability to effectively confine cells.

METHODS: Single-cell transcriptomic datasets of the early TE as well as the first- and second-trimester placentas have been reported1,2 . Here, we conducted the transcriptomic analysis of 4198 early TE cells, 1260 first-trimester placental cells and 189 EVTs at 24-week placentas (EVT_24W) by SMART-Seq2 method. Immunohistochemical staining of the human first-, second- and third- trimester placentas was performed to confirm bioinformatic results. RESULTS: Via bioinformatic analysis, we identified the existence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in human TE as well as in the first- and second- trimester placentas. In human TE data, 54.4% of TE1 cells, 9.0% of CTBs, 3.2% of EVTs and 29.5% of STBs were ACE2 positive. As for TMPRSS2, 90.7% of TE1 cells, 31.5% of CTBs, 22.1% of EVTs and 70.8% of STBs were TMPRSS2 positive. Amongst the placental cells, 20.4% of CTBs, 44.1% of STBs, 3.4% of EVT_8W and 63% of EVT_24W were ACE2 positive. And 1.6% of CTBs, 26.5% of STBs, 1.9% of EVT_8W and 20.1% of EVT_24W were TMPRSS2 positive. Pathway analysis revealed associations to morphogenesis of branching structure, extracellular matrix interaction, oxygen binding and antioxidant activity in ACE2+TMPRSS2+ EVT_24W cells. The ACE2+TMPRSS2+ TE1 cells were correlated with an increased capacity of viral invasion, epithelial cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Based on immunohistochemical results, expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in first- and second- and third-trimester placentas was observed.

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness in order to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear who is lonely in lockdown? Methods: This study compared socio-demographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n=31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL COVID-19 Social Study, n=60,341). Results: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical prior to and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone, and urban residents had a higher odds of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk for being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30, people with low household income, and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to usual (indicated by higher coefficients). Further, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those socio-demographic groups already identified as high-risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but to have an even higher odds than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","output":"Who is lonely in lockdown?

Investigating students' viewing behaviors while watching online video lectures is essential for instructors to understand their learning status so that the course content, structure, and media selection can be improved continuously. The current study identified the engagement level of the learners based on their online video-watching behaviors, and tested the correlation between the engagement level and learning outcome. METHODS: The action logs of watching online video lectures in 2020 Spring Pharmacology of the 4th-year medical students of the 6-year course and their feedbacks by questionnaires after each exam during the semester were provided anonymously. The data were analyzed and visualized for an efficient way to comprehend and interpret. To define the student's engagement level in his or her video-based learning journey, three viewing criteria, Completion, Pausing, and Repeated watching were identified. We evaluated the association between the engagement level and the students' learning outcomes, including their learning satisfaction, knowledge acquisition progresses based on assessment results, and the grades measured by the instructors. RESULTS: The graphs and the charts demonstrate whether the students allocated enough time to finish the video lectures (completion), paused for a while, then resumed the video (pausing), or replayed the specific sections of video content (repeated watching). The engagement level with video lectures, evaluated by pre-defined thresholds for Completion, Pausing, and Repeated watching had a positive correlation with the learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that an engagement dashboard containing real-time visualized information on students' online video-watching behaviors can be developed to help instructors to monitor students' learning progress and improve teaching in a timely fashion. It can also help each student to re-feel the stimulation of peers, prompt self-monitoring, improve their learning attitudes and disciplines for better learning outcomes.

To spread all the scientific outcomes and data around the world, all the major scientific journals and databases are providing open access to their content across the globe. Due to the focused research, a considerable amount of multidimensional data has been generated in a very short time to understand the fundamental behavior of the virus, which is useful for novel therapeutic development. Many countries are working on vaccine development;however progress towards the novel drug pipeline is also parallelly going on to reduce the mortality rate. From a 30kb size viral genome, many different experimentally characterized and validated proteins are identified followed by 3D structure determination to explore the antiviral targets more rapidly, which is included in this chapter. Proteases are always found as promising antiviral target proteins and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, cysteine proteases such as 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease) serve the same. Both cysteine proteases are involved in the cleavage process of polypeptide coming out from the RNA genome of the virus, and this cleavage assists in the replication apparatus complex formation necessary for the viral existence. To target proteases, many molecular mechanics-based computational screening protocols have been applied to find the inhibitors against them;however, due to the inherent limitation (selectivity) in the approach, no major success has been achieved yet. In the present study, we have reviewed different computational methods applied in search of inhibitors against the targets of COVID-19. In addition, using our method CliquePharm, we have attempted to generate the multi-target specific ab-initio pharmacophore models to search for the specific novel inhibitors from a database of antiviral chemicals. Apo-structures of both cysteine proteases are used to design the different sizes and types of the pharmacophore models, which are further utilized to screen the locally setup chemical database to identify the multi-class specific inhibitors. With the help of this study, we were not only able to explore the commonly available interactions within the selected proteases to capture the multi-targeted drugs but also this approach will suppress the chance of any resistance against the designed inhibitors.","output":"Molecular Multi-target Approach on COVID-19 for Designing Novel Chemicals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, and it subsequently spread in many countries around the world.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Influenza activity data from 2003C04 through 2007C08 were obtained from three US surveillance systems: Google Flu Trends, CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (CDC ILI Surveillance), and US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System (CDC Virus Surveillance). Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data. An analysis was performed to investigate outlier observations and determine the extent to which they affected the correlations between surveillance data. Pearson's correlation coefficient describing Google Flu Trends and CDC Virus Surveillance over the study period was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.79). The correlation between CDC ILI Surveillance and CDC Virus Surveillance over the same period was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.89).

Objective To determine whether it is feasible and safe to continue non-emergency surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic Design, setting and participants This is a cohort study of 500 consecutive patients undergoing non-emergency surgery in a dedicated COVID-19 cold site following the first case of COVID-19 that was reported in the institution. The study was carried out during the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, which currently has one of the highest number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 globally. We set up a hub-and-spoke surgical network amongst 14 National Health Service institutions during the pandemic. The hub was a cancer centre, which was converted into a COVID-19 cold site, performing urological, thoracic, gynaecological and general surgical operations. Outcomes The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and post-operative complications at 30-days. Results 500 patients underwent surgery with median age 62.5 (IQR 51-71). 65% were male and 60% had a known diagnosis of cancer. 44% of surgeries were performed with robotic or laparoscopic assistance and 61% were considered complex or major operations. None of the 500 patients undergoing surgery died from COVID-19 at 30-days. 30-day all-cause mortality was 3/500 (1%). 10 (2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 4 (1%) with confirmed laboratory diagnosis and 6 (1%) with probable COVID-19. 33/500 (7%) of patients developed Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications, with 1/33 (3%) occurring in a patient with COVID-19. Conclusion It is safe to continue non-emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate service reconfiguration.","output":"Evaluation of 30-day mortality for 500 patients undergoing non-emergency surgery in a COVID-19 cold site within a multicentre regional surgical network during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The link between oral bacteria and respiratory infections is well documented. Dental plaque has the potential to be colonized by respiratory pathogens and this, together with microaspiration of oral bacteria, can lead to pneumonia particularly in the elderly and critically ill. The provision of adequate oral care is therefore essential for the maintenance of good oral health and the prevention of respiratory complications. MAIN BODY: Numerous oral care practices are utilised for intubated patients, with a clear lack of consensus on the best approach for oral care. This narrative review aims to explore the oral-lung connection and discuss in detail current oral care practices to identify shortcomings and offer suggestions for future research. The importance of adequate oral care has been recognised in guideline interventions for the prevention of pneumonia, but practices differ and controversy exists particularly regarding the use of chlorhexidine. The oral health assessment is also an important but often overlooked element of oral care that needs to be considered. Oral care plans should ideally be implemented on the basis of an individual oral health assessment. An oral health assessment prior to provision of oral care should identify patient needs and facilitate targeted oral care interventions. CONCLUSION: Oral health is an important consideration in the management of the critically ill. Studies have suggested benefit in the reduction of respiratory complication such as Ventilator Associated Pneumonia associated with effective oral health care practices. However, at present there is no consensus as to the best way of providing optimal oral health care in the critically ill. Further research is needed to standardise oral health assessment and care practices to enable development of evidenced based personalised oral care for the critically ill.","output":"Oral health care for the critically ill: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with the oncogenic -herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) cause several severe malignancies in humans. Inhibition of the lytic replication of EBV and KSHV eliminates the reservoir of persistent infection and transmission, consequently preventing the occurrence of diseases from the sources of infection. Antiviral drugs are limited in controlling these viral infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate that niclosamide, an old anthelmintic drug, inhibits mTOR activation during EBV lytic replication. Consequently, niclosamide effectively suppresses EBV lytic gene expression, viral DNA lytic replication and virion production in EBV-infected lymphoma cells and epithelial cells. Niclosamide exhibits cytotoxicity toward lymphoma cells and induces irreversible cell cycle arrest in lytically EBV-infected cells. The ectopic overexpression of mTOR reverses the inhibition of niclosamide in EBV lytic replication. Similarly, niclosamide inhibits KSHV lytic replication. Thus, we conclude that niclosamide is a promising candidate for chemotherapy against the acute occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases of oncogenic -herpesviruses.","output":"Niclosamide inhibits lytic replication of Epstein-Barr virus by disrupting mTOR activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteriophages or phages are the most abundant organisms in the biosphere, and they have a unique feature for prokaryotic organisms.

METHODS: We used 2020 monthly Medicare data from January 1CSeptember 30, 2020, reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to compute hospitalization rates per 100 COVID-19 MBs with FFS claims who were hospitalized (ICD-10-CM codes: B97.29 before April 1, 2020; ICD-10-CM codes: U07.1 from April 1, 2020, onward) with or without selected chronic conditions. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for association of person-level rate of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and each of 27 chronic conditions by race/ethnicity, controlling for age, sex, and urban-rural residence among MBs. RESULTS: COVID-19-related hospitalizations were associated with all selected chronic conditions, except osteoporosis and Alzheimer disease/dementia among COVID-19 MBs. The top five conditions with the highest odds for hospitalization among COVID-19 MBs were end-stage renal disease (adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.15; 95% CI: 2.10C2.21), chronic kidney disease (aOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.52C1.56), acute myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.39C1.53), heart failure (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.41C1.44), and diabetes (aOR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.36C1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in hospitalization rate persist among MBs with COVID-19, and associations of COVID-19 hospitalization with chronic conditions differ among racial/ethnic groups in the USA.

To date, no published article has systematically reviewed the literature in aggregate to understand which instability values should be used intraoperatively. The primary aim was to systematically review the amount of tibiofibular displacement that correlates with syndesmotic instability after a high ankle sprain. A secondary aim is to assess the quality of such research. METHODS Systematic searches of EMBASE (Ovid) and MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were used. INCLUSION CRITERIA studies that arthroscopically evaluated the fibular displacement at various stages of syndesmotic ligament injury. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Anatomical Quality Assessment (AQUA) Tool and methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). RESULTS Eight cadaveric studies and three clinical studies were included for review. All studies reported displacement in the coronal plane, four studies reported in the sagittal plane, and one reported findings in the rotational plane. Four cadaveric studies had a similar experimental set up and the weighted mean associated with instability in the coronal plane could be calculated and was 2.9 mm at the anterior portion of the distal tibiofibular joint and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion. Syndesmotic instability in the sagittal plane is less extensively studied, however available data from a cadaveric study suggests thresholds of 2.2 mm of posterior fibular translation when performing an anterior to posterior hook test and 2.6 mm of anterior fibular translation when performing a posterior to anterior hook test. CONCLUSIONS The results have concluded that the commonly used 2.0 mm threshold value of distal tibiofibular diastasis may lead to overtreatment of syndesmotic instability, and that using threshold values of 2.9 mm measured at the anterior portion of the incisura and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion may represent better cut off values. Given the ready availability of 3 mm probes among standard arthroscopic instrumentation, at the very least surgeons should use 3 mm in lieu of 2 mm probes intraoperatively.

Recent results integrate grasp analysis with arm motion planning to compute optimal smooth arm motions; however, computation times on the order of tens of seconds dominate motion times. Recent advances in deep learning allow neural networks to quickly compute these motions; however, they lack the precision required to produce kinematically and dynamically feasible motions. While infeasible, the network-computed motions approximate the optimized results. The proposed method warm starts the optimization process by using the approximate motions as a starting point from which the optimizing motion planner refines to an optimized and feasible motion with few iterations. In experiments, the proposed deep learning-based warm-started optimizing motion planner reduces compute and motion time when compared to a sampling-based asymptotically optimal motion planner and an optimizing motion planner. When applied to grasp-optimized motion planning, the results suggest that deep learning can reduce the computation time by two orders of magnitude (300), from 29 s to 80 ms, making it practical for e-commerce warehouse picking.","output":"Deep learning can accelerate grasp-optimized motion planning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In so-called DX (Digital Transformation) age, the education field has been extended/exchanged rapidly to the online environment, which is logically an open and cyber space, composed virtually through information network, from the face-to-face environment, which is physically a closed space, organized really with persons.

However, the maximization of entropy is not considered in the mean-absolute deviation model according to past studies. In fact, higher entropy values give higher portfolio diversifications, which can reduce portfolio risk. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a multi-objective optimization model, namely a mean-absolute deviation-entropy model for portfolio optimization by incorporating the maximization of entropy. In addition, the proposed model incorporates the optimal value of each objective function using a goal-programming approach. The objective functions of the proposed model are to maximize the mean return, minimize the absolute deviation and maximize the entropy of the portfolio. The proposed model is illustrated using returns of stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that are listed in the New York Stock Exchange.

High-resolution video captures of 30 consecutive uncomplicated phacoemulsification surgeries, performed by 3 board-certified specialists in ophthalmology, were assessed by 2 independent and masked investigators for intraoperative aerosolization and fluid spillage. Water-contact indicator tape was mounted on the base of the operating microscope, around the objective lens, to detect any fluid contact. RESULTS: No visible intraoperative aerosolization was detected in any of the cases, irrespective of different surgical practices among the surgeons with regard to wound size and position, lens fragmentation technique, power settings and means of ocular lubrication, or the different densities of cataract encountered. Large droplets spillage was noted from the paracentesis wounds in 70% of the cases. For all cases where fluid spill was detected on video, there was no fluid contact detected on the water-contact indicator tape. CONCLUSION: Visible aerosolization was not detected during phacoemulsification in our case series.

A consumer survey conducted in Latvia (n = 1000) revealed attitudes and behavior in relation to: (a) food and shopping convenience values;(b) economic values;(c) prosocial values of food consumption (local and environmental friendly food). The purpose of the survey was to make quantitative measurements that reveal the main trends in the society of Latvia and what values are important for consumers, depending on their family status, level of education, place of residence and income level. The scientific discourse reveals that more support for prosocial food is observed among higher-income households living in a city which have children and higher education. Surprisingly, the research results did not confirm this. Although the support of this consumer segment for such food is relatively high, it is lower than that of other consumers.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hospital Cayetano Heredia; a tertiary care hospital in Lima, Peru. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (median age 59 years [IQR:49C68]; 241 (65.31%) male) were included. Most patients (68.56%) reported at least one comorbidity; more frequently: obesity (42.55%), diabetes mellitus (21.95%), and hypertension (21.68%). The median duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission was 7 days (IQR: 5C10). Reported in-hospital mortality was 49.59%. By multiple Cox regression, oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) values of less than 90% on admission correlated with mortality, presenting 1.86 (95%CI: 1.02C3.39), 4.44 (95%CI: 2.46C8.02) and 7.74 (95%CI: 4.54C13.19) times greater risk of death for SaO(2) of 89C85%, 84C80% and <80%, respectively, when compared to patients with SaO(2) >90%.

Assessing inequalities in risk of exposure and in adversities faced during the pandemic is critical to inform targeted actions that effectively prevent disproportionate spread and reduce social and health inequities. This study examines i) the socioeconomic and mental health characteristics of individuals working in the workplace, thus at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, and ii) individual income losses resulting from the pandemic across socioeconomic subgroups of a working population, during the first confinement in Portugal. METHODS: This study uses data from COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion, a community-based online survey in Portugal. The sample for analysis comprised n = 129,078 workers. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of factors associated with working in the workplace during the confinement period and with having lost income due to the pandemic. RESULTS: Over a third of the participants reported working in the workplace during the first confinement. This was more likely among those with lower income [AOR = 2.93 (2.64-3.25)], lower education [AOR = 3.17 (3.04-3.30)] and working as employee [AOR = 1.09 (1.04-1.15)]. Working in the workplace was positively associated with frequent feelings of agitation, anxiety or sadness [AOR = 1.14 (1.09-1.20)] and perception of high risk of infection [AOR = 11.06 (10.53-11.61)].

The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. RESULTS: Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television.

Isoquercetin is a monoglycosylated derivative of quercetin. When ingested, isoquercetin accumulates more than quercetin in the intestinal mucosa where it is converted to quercetin; the latter is absorbed into enterocytes, transported to the liver, released in circulation, and distributed to tissues, mostly as metabolic conjugates. Physiologically, isoquercetin and quercetin exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, and anticoagulant activities. Generally isoquercetin is less active than quercetin in vitro and ex vivo, whereas it is equally or more active in vivo, suggesting that it is primarily a more absorbable precursor to quercetin, providing more favorable pharmacokinetics to the latter. Isoquercetin, like quercetin, has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities, significantly reducing cell infection by influenza, Zika, Ebola, dengue viruses among others. This ability, together with their other physiological properties and their safety profile, has led to the proposition that administration of these flavonols could prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or arrest the progression to severity and lethality of resulting coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19). In silico screening of small molecules for binding affinity to proteins involved SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has repeatedly situated quercetin and isoquercetin near to top of the list of likely effectors. If experiments in cells and animals confirm these predictions, this will provide additional justifications for the conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of these flavonols in Covid-19.","output":"Isoquercetin as an Anti-Covid-19 Medication: A Potential to Realize"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate processing of temporal information is critical to understanding speech through a cochlear implant (CI). This has potential implications for the growing population of CI users who are &#8805;65 years of age because of age-related auditory temporal processing deficits. The goal of this study was to measure temporal processing ability in a gap detection task in younger, middle-aged, and older CI users and to determine the relative contributions of chronological age and peripheral neural survival to performance. Single-electrode gap detection thresholds (GDTs) were measured using direct stimulation at five electrode locations and three electrical stimulation rates. The relationship between peripheral status (e.g., electrode-to-neural interface) and GDTs was assessed by the slope of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth function. Results showed that ECAP slope was the strongest subject-level predictor of GDTs. Steeper ECAP slopes, which are partially indicative of better peripheral function, were associated with better GDTs in younger participants. However, ECAP slope significantly interacted with stimulation rate and age, suggesting that ECAP slopes were not predictive of GDTs in middle-aged and older participants at some stimulation rates. ECAP slope was also related to age, with middle-aged and older participants exhibiting relatively shallow slopes and smaller ranges of slopes compared with younger participants. This pattern of ECAP results limited the evaluation of the independent effects of aging per se and peripheral status on temporal processing ability.","output":"Impact of Aging and the Electrode-to-Neural Interface on Temporal Processing Ability in Cochlear-Implant Users: Gap Detection Thresholds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to increase the accuracy of determining the position of the tongue, the amount of space occupied by the tongue and space, free from tongue, increase of efficiency of diagnostics of dentofacial anomalies in patients based on CBCT analysis-the study of the skull conducted in transversal, sagittal and coronal planes. Clinical and x-ray examination and orthodontic treatment were carried out in 120 patients with anomalies of the dentition complex. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 - 30 patients aged 5 to 11 years. Group 2 - 50 patients aged 12 to 17 years. Group 3 - 40 patients aged 18 to 40 years.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in the early clinical stages of COVID-19. Methods We conducted a single-centre, outpatient setting, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design in Mexico. Including patients within three days of clinical symptom onset, who were at a high risk of severe clinical progression due to chronic comorbidities. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an oral dose of sulodexide (500 LRU twice a day) or the placebo for 21 days. Primary outcomes were need and length of hospitalization, need and length of oxygen support. Results Between June 5 and August 30, 2020, 243 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. One hundred twenty-four of them received sulodexide, while 119 received placeboes. At 21 days follow-up, 22 of 124 patients required hospitalisation in the sulodexide group compared to 35 of 119 in the placebo group [relative risk (RR), 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.96; p=0.03]. Fewer patients required oxygen support in the sulodexide group [37 of 124 vs. 50 of 119; RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1; p=0.05], and for fewer days [9 (7.2 SD) in the sulodexide group vs. 11.5 (9.6 SD) in the placebo group; p=0.02].

Recent studies correlate the spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with symptoms of depression, most prominent in postpartum women. Our systematic literature review scope is to identify the risk factors and predictors for postpartum depression (PPD) and describe the steps that should be taken to help postpartum women. This study will help clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to elucidate the predictors of PPD during this pandemic and prevent these adverse outcomes in future crises. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search by employing databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase to identify articles published before March 2021. About 463 publications were generated during our search process and from those, 36 were reviewed, summarized, and synthesized. Studies qualified the criteria if they (1) utilized qualitative or quantitative design, (2) explored the risk factors for PPD, and (3) were written in English. Quality evaluation of each study was achieved by using criteria set by Lincoln and Guba. RESULTS: Prevalence of depression symptoms ranged from 7% to 80.8% in postpartum women during the SARS-COV 2 pandemic. The risk factors for PPD were classified into 6 major categories: socio-demographic, psychological, pre-existing pathology, metabolic factors, previous events of miscarriage, and media misinformation. CONCLUSION: It is extremely vital to care for womens mental health during pregnancy and after childbirth during these unprecedented times.

Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil (B.1.1.28-E484K) have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless, the spread of B.1.1.28 (E484K) and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28 (E484K) lineage, demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28 (E484K) with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also, clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state (named VUI-NP13L) characterized by 12 lineage-defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion, co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13 L in Rio Grande do Sul, we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.","output":"Pervasive transmission of E484K and emergence of VUI-NP13L with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection events by two different lineages in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous efforts have been devoted to investigating the network activities and dynamics of isolated networks. Nevertheless, in practice, most complex networks might be interconnected with each other (due to the existence of common components) and exhibit layered properties while the connections on different layers represent various relationships. These types of networks are characterized as multiplex networks. A two-layered multiplex network model (usually composed of a virtual layer sustaining unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) dynamics and a physical one supporting susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) process) is presented to investigate the spreading property of fatal epidemics in this manuscript. Due to the incorporation of the virtual layer, the recovered and dead individuals seem to play different roles in affecting the epidemic spreading process. In details, the corresponding nodes on the virtual layer for the recovered individuals are capable of transmitting information to other individuals, while the corresponding nodes for the dead individuals (which are to be eliminated) on the virtual layer should be removed as well. With the coupled UAU-SIRD model, the relationships between the focused variables and parameters of the epidemic are studied thoroughly. As indicated by the results, the range of affected individuals will be reduced by a large amount with the incorporation of virtual layers. Furthermore, the effects of recovery time on the epidemic spreading process are also investigated aiming to consider various physical conditions. Theoretical analyses are also derived for scenarios with and without required time periods for recovery which validates the reducing effects of incorporating virtual layers on the epidemic spreading process.","output":"Investigation of epidemic spreading process on multiplex networks by incorporating fatal properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Italian government adopted measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection from March 9, 2020, to May 4, 2020 and imposed a phase of social distancing and self-isolation to all adult citizens. Although justified and necessary, psychologists question the impact of this process of COVID-19 isolation on the mental health of the population. Hence, this paper investigated the relationship between neuroticism, boredom, fantasy engagement, perceived control over time, and the fear of COVID-19. Specifically, we performed a cross-sectional study aimed at testing an integrative moderated mediation model. Our model assigned the boredom to the mediation role and both the fantasy engagement and perceived control of time to the role of moderators in the relationship between neuroticism and the fear of COVID-19. A sample of 301 subjects, mainly women (68.8%), aged between 18 and 57 years (M(age) = 22.12 years; SD = 6.29), participated in a survey conducted in the 1st-week lockdown phase 2 in Italy from May 7 to 18, 2020. Results suggested that neuroticism is crucial in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with literature showing high neurotic people having greater emotional reactivity and scarce resources to manage stress. We also found that people with high neuroticism tend to feel bored, and the relationship between neuroticism and boredom seems enhanced if one is involved in negative fantasies. Therefore, this result could also explain the positive effect between boredom and fear of COVID-19 we found in the current study. However, our data show that perceived control over time moderates the association between boredom and fear toward COVID-19. Having a high perceived control over time allows people to reduce boredoms effect on fear of COVID-19. In conclusion, we retain that psychological treatment programs could improve the individuals perceived control over time to modulate anxiety toward the fear of COVID-19 and promote psychological well-being.","output":"Neuroticism and Fear of COVID-19.

We stratified facilities by county COVID-19 incidence per 10,000 residents in each week and by 2018 fatal drug overdose rate. Finally, we conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis examining percent change in visits per week as a function of county-level COVID-19 tercile, a series of calendar month indicators, and the interaction of county-level COVID-19 tercile and month. We repeated the regression analysis replacing COVID-19 tercile with overdose tercile. RESULTS Beginning the eleventh week of 2020, the number of visits to SUDT facilities declined substantially, reaching a nadir of 48% of 2019 visits in early July. In contrast to January, there were significantly fewer visits in 2020 compared to 2019 in all subsequent months (p < 0.01 in all months). Multivariable regression results found that facilities in the tercile of counties experiencing the most COVID-19 cases had a significantly greater reduction in the number of SUDT visits in 2020 for the months of June through August than facilities in counties with the fewest COVID-19 rates (p < 0.05). The study found no statistically significant difference in the change in the number of visits by facilities in counties with historically different overdose rates.

With the migration of people, the epidemic has rapidly spread within China and throughout the world. Due to the severity of the epidemic, undiscovered transmission of COVID-19 deserves further investigation. The aim of our study hypothesized possible modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how the virus may have spread between two family clusters within a residential building in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we monitored and traced confirmed patients and their close contacts from January 11 to February 5, 2020 in Guangzhou, China, including 2 family cluster cases and 61 residents within one residential building. The environmental samples of the building and the throat swabs from the patients and from their related individuals were collected for SARS-CoV-2 and tested with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relevant information was collected and reported using big data tools. RESULTS: There were two notable family cluster cases in Guangzhou, which included 3 confirmed patients (family No.1: patient A, B, C) and 2 confirmed patients (family No.2: patient D, E), respectively. None of patients had contact with other confirmed patients before the onset of symptoms, and only patient A and patient B made a short stop in Wuhan by train. Home environment inspection results showed that the door handle of family No.1 was positive of SARS-CoV-2. The close contacts of the 5 patients all tested negative of SARS-CoV-2 and in good health, and therefore were released after the official medical observation period of 14-days. Finally, according to the traceability investigation through applying big data analysis, we found an epidemiological association between family No.1 and family No.2, in which patient D (family No.2) was infected through touching an elevator button contaminated by snot with virus from patient A (family No.1) on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminants with virus from confirmed patients can pollute the environment of public places, and the virus can survive on the surface of objects for a short period of time.

These next generation vaccines have shown high efficacy against COVID-19 and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. As widespread vaccinations efforts are taking place, incidents of myocarditis and pericarditis cases following vaccination have been reported. This safety signal has been recently confirmed by the European Medicine Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This study aimed to investigate and analyze this safety signal using a dual pharmacovigilance database analysis. Methods This is as an observational study of reports of inflammatory heart reactions associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reported in the World Health Organization's global individual case safety report database (up to June 30th 2021), and in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, up to May 21st 2021). Cases were described, and disproportionality analyses using reporting odds-ratios (ROR) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were performed to assess relative risk of reporting according to patient sex and age. Results At a global scale, the inflammatory heart reactions most frequently reported were myocarditis (1241, 55%) and pericarditis (851, 37%), the majority requiring hospitalization (n=796 (64%)). Overall, patients were young (median age 33 [21-54] years). The main age group was 18-29 years old (704, 31%), and mostly males (1555, 68%). Pericarditis onset was delayed compared to myocarditis with a median time to onset of 8 [3-21] vs. 3 [2-6] days, respectively (p=0.001). Regarding myocarditis, an important disproportionate reporting in males (ROR, 9.4 [8.3-10.6]) as well as in adolescents (ROR, 22.3 [19.2-25.9]) and 18-29 years old (ROR, 6.6 [5.9-7.5]) compared to older patients were observed. Conclusions The inflammatory heart reactions, namely myocarditis and pericarditis, have been reported world-wide shortly following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. An important disproportionate reporting among adolescents and young adults, particularly in males, was observed especially for myocarditis. Guidelines must take this specific risk into account and to optimize vaccination protocols according to sex and age.

Five females and two males, aged 23C51, participated in two online focus groups. Dating with a diagnosis of MS is a highly personal phenomenon, characterized by individual differences in values and experiences. Core to the phenomenon was personal decision-making about disclosure of the diagnosis and ongoing adaptation to the fluctuating nature of the condition with partners in new/developing relationships. The findings will help health professionals working with adults with MS understand this important aspect of their lives.","output":"Dating with a Diagnosis: The Lived Experience of People with Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has put lifestyles in question, changed daily routines, and limited citizen freedoms that seemed inalienable before. A human activity that has been greatly affected since the beginning of the health crisis is mobility. Focusing on mobility, we aim to discuss the transformational impact that the pandemic brought to this specific urban domain, especially with regards to the promotion of sustainability, the smart growth agenda, and the acceleration towards the smart city paradigm. We collect 60 initial policy responses related to urban mobility from cities around the world and analyze them based on the challenge they aim to address, the exact principles of smart growth and sustainable mobility that they encapsulate, as well as the level of ICT penetration. Our findings suggest that emerging strategies, although mainly temporary, are transformational, in line with the principles of smart growth and sustainable development. Most policy responses adopted during the first months of the pandemic, however, fail to leverage advancements made in the field of smart cities, and to adopt off-the-shelf solutions such as monitoring, alerting, and operations management.","output":"Smart and Resilient Urban Futures for Sustainability in the Post COVID-19 Era: A Review of Policy Responses on Urban Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bhutan has reopened schools and colleges after an initial closure to contain coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. However, the risk of transmissions is higher in the schools and colleges due to crowding. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward COVID-19 among the students of Sherubtse College in Bhutan. A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire was conducted in September 2020 among the students of Sherubtse College, Bhutan. The questionnaire was made in the Google Forms and administered through a social forum WeChat app. The KAP scores were calculated that include mean scores. The association between the KAP was assessed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. A total of 613 students participated in the survey. The majority of the participants (57%) were female and 56% were from the third year. The mean knowledge score was 10.7 (SD = 1.7; range 0C14), mean attitude score of 3.67 (SD = 1.0; range: 0C5), and mean practice score of 5.19 (SD = range: 0C6). A majority of the students had good knowledge (98%) and practice (93.5%) scores, and a positive attitude (86.6%) toward COVID-19. A positive but weak correlation between good knowledge and practice (r = 0.1, p = 0.0126) was observed. Having a positive attitude led to practicing appropriately most of the time (r = 0.1866, p < 0.001). The students had good KAP scores and followed the COVID-19 prevention protocols advocated by the government. Good knowledge and a positive attitude were translated into good practice. Therefore, the education campaign of the Bhutan government seems to be effective in the students.","output":"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Toward COVID-19 Among Sherubtse College Students in Bhutan: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACEIs on COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0 049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0 008) Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9 3% vs 22 9%;p=0 061), and a lower death rate (4 7% vs 13 3%;p=0 216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension","output":"Effects Of ARBs And ACEIs On Virus Infection, Inflammatory Status And Clinical Outcomes In COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension: A Single Center Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the world population is steadily increasing, the capacity of Earth to renew its resources is continuously declining.

The current study aims to explore the effects of instructional interactions on individuals learning outcomes (i.e., academic performance and learning satisfaction) based on the Interactive Equivalence Theory by conducting two empirical studies. In Study 1, we explored the direct relationships between instructional interactions and learning outcomes. A quasi-experimental design was used to manipulate the two groups of subjects (n(1) = 192; n(2) = 195), and the results show that not all of the three types of interaction can significantly positively predict learning satisfaction, among which ST cannot significantly predict learning satisfaction. When the total amount of instructional interactions is constant, adjusting the relative level of the three types of instructional interactions can effectively improve the learning outcomes to some extent. We further probed into the mediating effects of task value and self-regulated learning on the relationships between instructional interactions and learning outcomes in Study 2. We conducted an online survey and collected 374 valid data. The results showed that task values mediated the relationship between SS and learning satisfaction. In addition, SC can not only directly affect learning satisfaction, but also affect it through task value and self-regulated learning respectively, or via chain mediations of both task value and self-regulated learning.

When data contains private and sensitive information, the data owner often desires to publish a synthetic database instance that is similarly useful as the true data, while ensuring the privacy of individual data records. Existing differentially private data synthesis methods aim to generate useful data based on applications, but they fail in keeping one of the most fundamental data properties of the structured data -- the underlying correlations and dependencies among tuples and attributes (i.e., the structure of the data). This structure is often expressed as integrity and schema constraints, or with a probabilistic generative process. As a result, the synthesized data is not useful for any downstream tasks that require this structure to be preserved. This work presents Kamino, a data synthesis system to ensure differential privacy and to preserve the structure and correlations present in the original dataset. Kamino takes as input of a database instance, along with its schema (including integrity constraints), and produces a synthetic database instance with differential privacy and structure preservation guarantees. We empirically show that while preserving the structure of the data, Kamino achieves comparable and even better usefulness in applications of training classification models and answering marginal queries than the state-of-the-art methods of differentially private data synthesis.","output":"Kamino: Constraint-Aware Differentially Private Data Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, researchers across the globe are still working to develop effective vaccines.

In such trials, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the pathogen of interest, enabling scientists to study the infection process and facilitate further research on treatments or prophylactics, including vaccines. While human challenge trials would offer a collective benefit to society, minimizing the risks is always difficult. Ethical controversy thus inevitably surrounds these trials. Typically, healthy young adults are recruited to serve as the first candidate subjects for human challenge trials because they are generally considered to represent a low-risk population.

Each device was reviewed regarding biophysical laws, indication, strength, limitations, correct technique of use, frequent mistakes, and device cleaning and maintenance. Nebulization should be restricted to drugs that are not available in other IDs (for example, for treatment of cystic fibrosis) or where other devices fail.

STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. METHODS: Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% ([Formula: see text]) of cases during the import phase and 61% ([Formula: see text]) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics. RESULTS: The spot map effectively illustrated clusters by residency, with the inner-city sustaining the highest attack rate (33.42 per 100,000), followed by an easterly distribution 5C30 km away (21.62 per 10,000), and lowest in districts 60C160 km away (9.21 per 100,000). The new epidemic curve shows the outbreak commencing 10 days earlier than initially reported, with a three-fold greater increase in cases during the escalation phase than previously estimated. CONCLUSION: In hindsight, the investigation of the Beijing SARS would have benefited from the use of spot maping as an essential outbreak tool for early identification of specific geographical area(s) for quarantining. If a spot map of incidence density rates was used during the early phase of the outbreak, the inner city might have been identified as a major risk factor requiring rapid quarantining. Contact history became uncommon as the outbreak progressed, suggesting that hospitals were over-burdened or pathogenesis and environment risk factors changed, strengthening the usefulness of early spot mapping and the need to modify risk factors included as contact history as the epidemic progresses.","output":"Hindsight: A re-analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Beijing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the resilience of health care systems worldwide. In this regard, one group of people whose physical and mental health has been affected has been family caregivers of people with dementia. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the variables that predict a high degree of well-being in family caregivers of people with dementia during this period of mandatory lockdown. METHODS: A total of 310 respondents participated in an online survey (266 women and 44 men) from various regions in Spain, aged between 20 and 73 years old (M = 46.45; SD = 15.97), and all were family members.

Tests were carried out using dry and humid gaseous samples containing about 100 representative chemicals found in exhaled breath and ambient air. Samples were collected in commercially available sorbent tubes, i.e. Tenax GR and a combination of Tenax TA, Carbograph 1TD and Carboxen 1003. Our results showed that all compounds were stable at room temperature up to 72 h and that sample humidity was the key factor affecting the stability of the compounds upon thermal treatment. Tenax GR-based sorbent tubes were less impacted by the thermal treatment, showing variations in the range 20%-30% for most target analytes. A significant loss of aldehydes and sulphur compounds was observed using carbon molecular sieve-based tubes. In this case, a dry purge step before inactivation at 60 C significantly reduced the loss of the target analytes, whose variations were comparable to the method variability.

However, these considerations may only be the tip of the iceberg; most resources are dedicated to the struggle against COVID-19, and this unprecedented situation may compromise the management of patients admitted with cardiovascular conditions. AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on cardiovascular admissions in France. METHODS: We asked nine major cardiology centres to give us an overview of admissions to their nine intensive cardiac care units for acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure, before and after containment measures. RESULTS: Before containment (02-16 March 2020), the nine participating intensive cardiac care units admitted 4.81.6 patients per day, versus 2.61.5 after containment (17-22 March 2020) (rank-sum test P=0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm here, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number of cardiovascular admissions after the establishment of containment. Many hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, but we feel it is time raise the alarm about the risk for patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease, who may suffer from lack of attention, leading to severe consequences (an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths, heart failure, etc.).

Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. METHODS: We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. RESULTS: Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998.

Historically, early intervention studies in patients with CLL/SLL with non-specific chemoimmunotherapy agents have not resulted in an overall survival (OS) benefit and have resulted in toxicity. The introduction of targeted therapies, such as venetoclax (an oral BCL2 inhibitor;V) and obinutuzumab (an intravenous anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody;O), have provided tolerable/efficacious options for patients with CLL. In the CLL14 study, symptomatic patients with CLL receiving frontline therapy with VO had longer progression-free survival (PFS) and deeper remissions [more undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD)] compared with those receiving chlorambucil and O (Fischer 2019). The CLL-International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI;Table 1) is a validated prognostic model to predict which patients are at highest risk of a shorter time to first therapy and shorter OS. A score of 4 is considered high-risk on this scale. We aim to use VO as early intervention in asymptomatic, high-risk CLL patients, assessed by CLL-IPI, to potentially improve OS and thus alter the natural history of the disease. Methods: On 12/14/20, we activated the S1925 study (NCT#04269902 ) for adult patients with CLL or SLL, who were diagnosed within 12 months of enrollment. Eligible patients have a CLL-IPI score 4 (Table 1) or complex cytogenetics (3 cytogenetic abnormalities) and do not meet any criteria for initiation of treatment by the International Working Group for CLL (IWCLL;Hallek 2018) guidelines. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 2:1 manner to early versus delayed (at the time IWCLL indication for treatment is met) therapy with VO (Figure 1). VO is administered as previously described (Fischer 2019). The primary endpoint is OS. We hypothesize that early intervention with VO will improve the rate of 6-year OS from 60% to 80%. This design requires 222 eligible patients for 88% power (2-sided a=0.05) for the primary comparison. To allow for 10% ineligibility, we will enroll 247 patients. Estimated accrual time is 4 years. Secondary endpoints include: rates of response, PFS, and relapse-free survival;safety;time to second CLL-directed therapy;and quality of life (assessed by FACT-Leukemia). As COVID19 is an infection with particularly high morbidity and mortality in patients with CLL, incidence of this infection and complications including death will be recorded and compared between patients followed on the early versus delayed intervention arms. The primary translational objective is to evaluate the prognostic association between OS and peripheral blood MRD status at 15 months after treatment initiation by flow cytometry. Secondary translational objectives include describing the association of other clinical outcomes, baseline prognostic factors, and IWCLL-defined response with MRD status at multiple timepoints. Current Status: At the time of submission, 7 patients have been registered and randomized per protocol. Accrual is ongoing.

Amongst various plausible factors, impairment in immune functions is emerging as a critical regulator of known age-associated accumulation of SC. Immune cells dysfunctions with age are multi-faceted and are uniquely attributed to the independent processes of immunosenescence and cellular senescence which may collectively impair immune system mediated clearance of SC. Moreover, being functionally and phenotypically heterogenic, immune cells are also liable to be affected by senescence microenvironment in other tissues. Therefore, strategies aimed at improving immunosenescence and cellular senescence in immune cells can have pleiotropic effects on ageing physiology including the accumulation of SC. In this regard, nutraceutical's immunomodulatory attributes are well documented which may have implications in developing nutrition-oriented immunotherapeutic approaches against SC. In particular, the three diverse sources of bioactive ingredients, viz., phytochemicals, probiotic bacteria and omega-3-fatty acids have shown promising anti-immunosenescence and anti-cellular senescence potential in immune cells influencing aging and immunity in ways beyond modest stimulation of immune responses. The present narrative review describes the preventive and therapeutic attributes of phytochemicals such as polyphenols, probiotic microbes and omega-3-fatty acids in influencing the emerging nexus of immunosenescence, cellular senescence and SC during aging. Outstanding questions and nutraceuticals-based pro-longevity and niche research areas have been deliberated. Further research using integrative approaches is recommended for developing nutrition-based holistic immunotherapeutic strategies for 'healthy ageing'.","output":"Nutraceuticals-Based Immunotherapeutic Concepts and Opportunities for the Mitigation of Cellular Senescence and Aging: A Narrative Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activated protein C (APC) is an anticoagulant with potent cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.

Transcriptome analysis of HEK 293T cells treated with wild and mutant APC revealed differentially expressed genes enriched in inflammatory, apoptotic, and virus defense-related signaling pathways. Both wild and mutant APC displayed concentration-dependent cytoprotective effects. Low concentrations of K150del mutant resulted in decreased anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, whereas its higher concentrations restored these effects. Expression of virus defense-related genes improved in mouse lung tissues after repeated administration of the APC variant.

In the past, radical cystectomy via open surgery has been considered the gold-standard treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, in recent years there has been a progressive increase in the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The aim of the current project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy comparing three different surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri- and post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period of up to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital readmission, sexual performance, and continence. METHODS: We describe a protocol for an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study to assess patients affected by bladder neoplasms undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry is an electronic registry to prospectively collect the data of patients undergoing radical cystectomy conducted with any technique (open, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted). Twenty-eight urology departments across Italy will provide data for the study, with the recruitment phase between 1st January 2017-31st October 2020. Information is collected from the patients at the moment of surgical intervention and during follow-up (3, 6, 12, and 24 months after radical cystectomy). Peri-operative variables include surgery time, type of urinary diversion, conversion to open surgery, bleeding, nerve sparing and lymphadenectomy. Follow-up data collection includes histological information (e.g., post-op staging, grading, and tumor histology), short- and long-term outcomes (e.g., mortality, post-op complications, hospital readmission, sexual potency, continence etc). DISCUSSION: The current protocol aims to contribute additional data to the field concerning the short- and long-term outcomes of three different radical cystectomy surgical techniques for patients with bladder cancer, including open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. This is a comparative-effectiveness trial that takes into account a complex range of factors and decision making by both physicians and patients that affect their choice of surgical technique.

Yellow fever virus 17D (YF17D) is a live-attenuated virus vaccine with an impressive efficacy record in humans, and therefore, it is a very attractive platform for the development of novel chimeric vaccines against various pathogens. In the present study, we generated a YF17D-based replicon vaccine platform by replacing the prM and E surface proteins of YF17D with antigenic subdomains from the spike (S) proteins of three different betacoronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV. The prM and E proteins were provided in trans for the packaging of these RNA replicons into single-round infectious particles capable of expressing coronavirus antigens in infected cells. YF17D replicon particles expressing the S1 regions of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike proteins were immunogenic in mice and elicited (neutralizing) antibody responses against both the YF17D vector and the coronavirus inserts. Thus, YF17D replicon-based vaccines, and their potential DNA- or mRNA-based derivatives, may constitute a promising and particularly safe vaccine platform for current and future emerging coronaviruses.","output":"A Yellow Fever 17D Virus Replicon-Based Vaccine Platform for Emerging Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have developed a simple electrochemical biosensing strategy for the label-free diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) on a gold electrode surface.

The duration of antibiotic use is a good predictor of prognosis in patients with VAP, but the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP in critically ill patients has not been confirmed. Research is therefore needed into the optimal duration of antibiotic use and its impact on VAP. Methods: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database included 1,609 patients with VAP. Chi-square or Students t-tests were used to compare groups, and Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the prognoses of patients with VAP. Nonlinear tests were performed on antibiotic use lasting <7, 7C10, and >10 days. Significant factors were included in the model for sensitivity analysis. For the subgroup analyses, the body mass indexes (BMIs) of patients were separated into BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI 30 kg/m2, with the criterion of statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Restricted cubic splines were used to analyze the relationship between antibiotic use duration and mortality risk in patients with VAP. Results: In patients with VAP, the effects of antibiotic use duration on the outcomes were nonlinear. Antibiotic use for 7C10 days in models 1C3 increased the risk of antibiotic use by 2.6020-, 2.1642-, and 2.3263-fold relative to for >10 days, respectively. The risks in models 1C3 for <7 days were 2.6510-, 1.9933-, and 2.5151-fold higher than those in models with >10 days of antibiotic use, respectively. These results were robust across the analyses. Conclusions: The duration of antibiotic treatment had a nonlinear effect on the prognosis of patients with VAP. Antibiotic use durations of <7 days and 7C10 days both presented risks, and the appropriate duration of antibiotic use can ensure the good prognosis of patients with VAP.","output":"Using Restricted Cubic Splines to Study the Duration of Antibiotic Use in the Prognosis of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of the practitioners profile regarding their motivation level for physical exercise engagement could be a behavioral strategy to increase exercise adherence.

Therefore, this study aimed to (1) investigate to what extent event participants have modified their sport behaviour as a result of the COVID-19 measures, and (2) analyse the factors that determine participation in virtual events (real activities using an online recording platform). Research methods: A total of 2869 respondents completed an online survey which was widely disseminated in Flanders (Belgium) six weeks after the announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown. The sample included both event and non-event participants. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate how event participants adapted their sport behaviour and which factors determined virtual event participation. Results and findings: Since the COVID-19 measures, event participants did not decrease the frequency but only the intensity of their sport behaviour. Based on social ecological theory, participation in virtual events could be explained by both individual determinants (e.g. motivation towards developing skills), and interpersonal determinants (e.g. previous participation in a virtual event). Implications: This study contributes to research on the impact of COVID-19 measures and consequently the cancellation of PSEs on sport behaviour of event participants.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, characteristics and outcome of IHCA during the pandemic in comparison to an earlier period. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively recorded during 3-month-periods 2019 and 2020 at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). All consecutive adult patients with IHCA were included. Clinical parameters, neurological outcomes and organ failure/support were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period hospital admissions declined from 18,262 (2019) to 13,994 (2020) (- 23%). The IHCA incidence increased from 4.6 (2019: 84 IHCA cases) to 6.6 (2020: 93 IHCA cases)/1000 hospital admissions. Median stay before IHCA was 4 (1-9) days. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both periods. IHCA location shifted towards the ICU (56% vs 37%, p < 0.01); shockable rhythm (VT/VF) (18% vs 29%, p = 0.05) and defibrillation were more frequent in the pandemic period (20% vs 35%, p < 0.05). Resuscitation times, rates of ROSC and post-CA characteristics were comparable in both periods. The severity of illness (SAPS II/SOFA), frequency of mechanical ventilation and frequency of vasopressor therapy after IHCA were higher during the 2020 period. Overall, 43 patients (12 with & 31 without COVID-19), presented with respiratory failure at the time of IHCA. The Horowitz index and resuscitation time were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 (each p < 0.01). Favourable outcomes were observed in 42 and 10% of patients with and without COVID-19-related respiratory failure, respectively.

The pharmacodynamics parameters of the inhibitors were predicted using admetSAR. The top two ligands (Nafamostat and VR23) based on docking scores were selected for further studies. Selected ligands showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with proper absorption, bioavailability and minimal toxicity. Due to the emerging and efficiency of remdesivir and dexamethasone in healing COVID-19 patients, ADMET properties of the selected ligands were thus compared with it.

In the current sub-Saharan Africa context, still marked by uncertainty surrounding the spread of COVID-19, we present the protocol of an ongoing longitudinal study aimed at investigating COVID-19-related attitudes, risks perceptions, preventive behaviours and economic impact in rural areas in Senegal. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective randomised longitudinal study of 600 households located in three semiurban villages and nine randomly selected rural villages in the Niakhar area (located 135 km East of Dakar). Three ad hoc phone surveys are administered to 600 heads of households, their housewives in charge of managing the household and a relative living temporarily in the household, respectively. In addition to sharing identical sets of questions on several topics (risks perceptions, attitudes to curfew, attitudes to vaccines, beliefs about COVID-19 infection), the three separate survey questionnaires also include other topics (economic impact, local preventive strategies) whose related questions differ between questionnaires. As analysing evolutions is the studys primary focus, data on all the topics covered will be collected in three waves unless the spread of COVID-19 by mid-2021 justifies extending data collection. The present article presents the study protocol and details about the implementation of the first wave of data collection which started in July 2020. The decision to wait before presenting the protocol was based on the unprecedented context the COVID-19 pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The surveys protocol was approved by the Senegalese National Ethical Committee for Research in Health (131/MSAS/CNERS/Sec) and received authorisation from both the Senegalese Ministry of Health (619/MSAS/DPRS/DR) and the French Commission on Information Technology and Liberties (CNIL 2220771).","output":"COVID-19-related attitudes, risk perceptions, preventive behaviours and economic impact in sub-Saharan African countries: implementing a longitudinal phone-based survey protocol in rural Senegalese households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The evidence of using JAK inhibitors among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is conflicting. The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address the efficacy of Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors in reducing risk of mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Several electronic databases, including PubMed, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with relevant keywords COVID-19 AND (JAK inhibitor OR Ruxolitinib OR Tofacitinib OR Fedratinib OR Baricitinib) AND (Severe OR Mortality), were used to perform a systematic literature search up to December 11, 2020. All studies pertinent to the predetermined eligibility criteria were included in the analysis. Our outcome of interest was all types of mortality, clinical improvement, and clinical deterioration. Dichotomous variables of our outcomes of interest were analyzed using Maentel-Haenszel formula to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with random-effects modeling regardless of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 1190 patients and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of JAK inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28C0.93, P = 0.02; I(2): 7.8%, P = 0.354) and clinical improvement (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05C2.95, P = 0.032; I(2): 26.4%, P = 0.253).

The goal of this study is to offer an agile typology of communication between migrant children in Poland and their grandparents in other countries. It points to two types of family communication practices, namely direct (face-to-face) and technology-mediated communication (TMC). Drawing on data from a qualitative study of immigrant children (n = 19) and parents (n = 18) conducted during the lockdown and associated travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the study offers a typology of emotional, symbolic, mediated, and discontinuous modes of intergenerational family communications. It also indicates that cessation of direct contact during an immobility regime reduces the scope of intergenerational communication in transnational families.

This paper addresses the personalisation of beer properties in the specific case of craft beers where the production process is more flexible. Furthermore, this work presents a solution discovery method that could be suitable for more complex, industrial setups. An evolutionary computation technique was used to map brewers' desired organoleptic properties to their constrained ingredients to design novel recipes tailored for specific brews. While there exist several mathematical tools, using the original mathematical and chemistry formulas, or machine learning models that deal with the process of determining beer properties based on the predetermined quantities of ingredients, this work investigates an automated quantitative ingredient-selection approach. The process, which was applied to this problem for the first time, was investigated in a number of simulations by \\"cloning\\" several commercial brands with diverse properties. Additional experiments were conducted, demonstrating the system's ability to deal with on-the-fly changes to users' preferences during the optimisation process. The results of the experiments pave the way for the discovery of new recipes under varying preferences, therefore facilitating the personalisation and alternative high-fidelity reproduction of existing and new products.","output":"Evolutionary Optimisation of Beer Organoleptic Properties: A Simulation Framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent work indicates that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus.

Considering the large amount of examinations in high case-load scenarios, an automated tool could facilitate and save critical time in the diagnosis and risk stratification of the disease. METHODS: A novel deep learning derived machine learning (ML) classifier was developed using a simplified programming approach and an open source dataset consisting of 6868 chest CT images from 418 patients which was split into training and validation subsets. The diagnostic performance was then evaluated and compared to experienced radiologists on an independent testing dataset. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Operating points with high positive (>10) and low negative (<0.01) likelihood ratios to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present were identified and validated. RESULTS: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.956 (AUC) on an independent testing dataset of 90 patients. Both rule-in and rule out thresholds were identified and tested. At the rule-in operating point, sensitivity and specificity were 84.4% and 93.3% and did not differ from both radiologists (p > 0.05). At the rule-out threshold, sensitivity (100%) and specificity (60%) differed significantly from the radiologists (p < 0.05). Likelihood ratios and a Fagan nomogram provide prevalence independent test performance estimates. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using a basic deep learning approach is feasible using open-source CT image data. In addition, the machine learning classifier provided validated rule-in and rule-out criteria could be used to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present.","output":"Deep learning analysis provides accurate COVID-19 diagnosis on chest computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health emergency, and the high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised serious concerns.

Upon gastrointestinal infection, chronic abdominal pain and anxio-depressive comorbidities may persist despite pathogen clearance leading to Post-Infectious IBS (PI-IBS). This study assesses the influence of tryptophan metabolism, and particularly the microbiota-induced AhR expression, on intestinal homeostasis disturbance following gastroenteritis resolution, and evaluates the efficacy of IL-22 cytokine vectorization on PI-IBS symptoms. The Citrobacter rodentium infection model in C57BL6/J mice was used to mimic Enterobacteria gastroenteritis. Intestinal homeostasis was evaluated as low-grade inflammation, permeability, mucosa-associated microbiota composition, and colonic sensitivity. Cognitive performances and emotional state of animals were assessed using several tests. Tryptophan metabolism was analyzed by targeted metabolomics. AhR activity was evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay method. One Lactococcus lactis strain carrying an eukaryotic expression plasmid for murine IL-22 (L. lactis(IL?22)) was used to induce IL-22 production in mouse colonic mucosa. C. rodentium-infected mice exhibited persistent colonic hypersensitivity and cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviors after pathogen clearance. These post-infectious disorders were associated with low-grade inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, decrease of Lactobacillaceae abundance associated with the colonic layer, and increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). During post-infection period, the indole pathway and AhR activity were decreased due to a reduction of tryptophol production. Treatment with L. lactis(IL?22) restored gut permeability and normalized colonic sensitivity, restored cognitive performances and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Data from the video-tracking system suggested an upgrade of welfare for mice receiving the L.lactis(IL?22) strain. Our findings revealed that AhR/IL-22 signaling pathway is altered in a preclinical PI-IBS model. IL-22 delivering alleviate PI-IBS symptoms as colonic hypersensitivity, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behaviors by acting on intestinal mucosa integrity. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway could be developed to treat IBS patients suffering from chronic abdominal pain and associated well-being disorders.","output":"AhR/IL-22 pathway as new target for the treatment of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research aims to evaluate the development trends of Ukrainian regions in conditions of COVID-19 spread under the impact of financial and investment determinants.

These sectors are most sensitive to public policy measures, particularly in conditions of social turbulence. The analysis of financial determinants of regional development in conditions of the corona crisis has contributed to outlining the following negative trends: substantial decline in investments in the economy of regions and a falling share of new investment projects are the most negative consequences that will essentially affect the paces of economic growth in the following periods;deteriorating business climate, falling volumes of loans provided to economic entities, and growing share of short-term loans have affected new investment decisions;failure to fulfill the planned rates of the local budgets' main revenue-generating indicators (PIT, local taxes) has affected the volumes of revenues from local budgets, including the investment ones;decline in transfers to local budgets from the public one has affected the funding of regional development programs;the foreign capital outflow occurred not only because of the deteriorating business climate in the country but also the inclusive nature of the COVID-19 pandemics and psychological-emotional factors of impact on the investors' behavior in conditions of uncertainty.

A Spider protection filter was used to capture any possible macro- or microemboli generated during balloon inflation/stenting. Arterial outflow was angiographically checked during each consecutive procedural step. All filters were examined on site for macroscopic material, while the first 20 filters underwent further histopathological qualitative and semiquantitative analysis using a 0+ to 3+ score. RESULTS There was no angiographically or clinically evident distal embolization. Macroscopic particulate debris was not detected in any filter. Histopathology confirmed the absence of macroemboli but revealed microembolic material (diameter <100 m) in all filters (20/20). The mean number of particles detected was 9.44.5 (range 5-17). Histopathological findings included fibrin conglomerates (20/20), trapped erythrocytes (19/20), inflammatory cells (16/20), calcification minerals (6/20), extracellular matrix (6/20), cholesterol clefts (6/20), and endothelial cells (6/20).

We conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses (CoV) and their possible effects on brain structural and functional integrity. It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms. This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks. Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients. It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.","output":"HOW TO DETECT AND TRACK CHRONIC NEUROLOGIC SEQUELAE OF COVID-19?

Spain is among the European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources. Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season. Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.","output":"The first wave of the Spanish COVID-19 epidemic was associated with early introductions and fast spread of a dominating genetic variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has changed rapidly since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the education community has not been immune to these changes.

As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the antigens, and thus limits T-cell-mediated immunity. To address this, alum is packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE). \\"Inheriting\\" from alum and squalene, PAPE demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross-presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum-treated groups, more than six times higher antigen-specific antibody titer and three-fold more IFN-?3-secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the enhanced COVID-19 vaccinations.","output":"Particulate Alum via Pickering Emulsion for an Enhanced COVID-19 Vaccine Adjuvant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans live increasingly in the proximity of natural areas, leading to increased interactions between people, their livestock and wildlife. AIM: We explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission (foot\\\\and\\\\mouth disease [FMD]) between cattle and the African buffalo (the maintenance host) and how a top predator, the lion, may modulate these interactions. LOCATION: The interface of Hwange National Park (HNP) and surrounding communal lands, Zimbabwe. METHOD: We combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for FMD, GPS\\\\collar data and cattle owners interviews during four seasons in 2010C2011. RESULTS: Overall FMD incidence in cattle was low, but showed a peak during the rainy season. The incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area (i.e., buffer zone of 3 km inside HNP) and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle. These results suggest that FMD virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species. The analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that (1) buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that (2) lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions. Lions could thus reduce the spatio\\\\temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface, which could contribute to the low level of FMD incidence. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: During the rainy season, traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the HNP but not during the dry season, suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the HNP.

Evaluating the quality of therapeutic data collected during this most recent pandemic is important for improving future clinical research under similar circumstances. OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality and variability in implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treating COVID-19, and to analyze the support that should be provided to improve data collected during an urgent pandemic situation. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP, and the preprint repositories including Social Science Research Network and MedRxiv were systematically searched, up to September 30, 2020, using the keywords coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), randomized controlled trial (RCT) and random. INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTs studying the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of published RCTs for inclusion and data extraction were each conducted by two researchers. Analysis of general information on COVID-19 RCTs was done using descriptive statistics. Methodological quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias tools in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 5.1.0). Variability in implementation was assessed by comparing consistency between RCT reports and registration information. RESULTS: A total of 5886 COVID-19 RCTs were identified. Eighty-one RCTs were finally included, of which, 45 had registration information. Methodological quality of the RTCs was not optimal due to deficiencies in five main domains: allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Comparisons of consistency between published protocols and registration information showed that the 45 RCTs with registration information had common deviations in seven items: inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, outcomes, research sites of recruitment, interventions, and blinding. CONCLUSION: The methodological quality of COVID-19 RCTs conducted in early to mid 2020 was consistently low and variability in implementation was common. More support for implementing high-quality methodology is needed to obtain the quality of therapeutic evidence needed to provide positive guidance for clinical care. We make an urgent appeal for accelerating the construction of a collaborative sharing platform and preparing multidisciplinary talent and professional teams to conduct excellent clinical research when faced with epidemic diseases of the future. Further, variability in RCT implementation should be clearly reported and interpreted to improve the utility of data resulting from those trials.

However, the majority of ECMO-supported patients failed to wean from ECMO therapy. As one of several options, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation serves as effective intervention in the improvement of cardiovascular and respiratory function in various major critical illness. Nonetheless, its role in facilitating ECMO weaning has not yet been explored. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on rate of ready for ECMO weaning in ECMO-supported patients (CaRe-ECMO). Methods: The CaRe-ECMO trial is a randomized controlled, parallel group, clinical trial. This trial will be performed in a minimum number of 366 ECMO-supported eligible patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to either: (1) the CaRe-ECMO group, which will be treated with usual care including pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacotherapy, and specific nursing for ECMO therapy and the CaRe-ECMO program; or (2) the control group, which will receive usual care only. The CaRe-ECMO program consists of protocolized positioning, passive range of motion (PROM) training, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), surface electrical phrenic nerve stimulation (SEPNS), and pulmonary rehabilitation. The primary outcome of the CaRe-ECMO trial is the rate of ready for ECMO weaning at CaRe-ECMO day 7 (refers to 7 days after the CaRe-ECMO program initiation). Secondary outcomes include rate of ECMO and mechanical ventilation weaning, total length in day of ready for ECMO weaning, ECMO weaning and mechanical ventilation, all-cause mortality, rate of major post-ECMO complications, ECMO unit length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS, total cost for hospitalization, cerebral performance category (CPC), activities of daily living (ADL), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Discussion: The CaRe-ECMO is designed to answer the question whether cardiopulmonary rehabilitation can facilitate weaning of ECMO (CaRe-ECMO). Should the implementation of the CaRe-ECMO program result in superior primary and secondary outcomes as compared to the controls, specifically the add-on effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation to the routine ECMO practice for facilitating successful weaning, the CaRe-ECMO trial will offer an innovative treatment option for ECMO-supported patients and meaningfully impact on the standard care in ECMO therapy.

To this end, we sampled vegetation and topsoil at a known Zn-Pb-Ag anomaly at Kangerluarsuk, northwest Greenland. This Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization surfaces in part of the test area and is deeply buried in other parts. The surface mineralization could readily be identified by element analysis of the omnipresent plant S. glauca. The strongest signal came from the pathfinder element Tl. The target elements Pb and Ag gave only weak signals and Zn gave no signal, probably because the cellular concentration of these elements is actively regulated by the plant. The use of regulated plant micronutrients as reference elements gave a small reduction of analytical noise in Tl/Cu and Tl/B concentration ratios at low Tl concentrations which improved identification of the deep mineralization. Pathfinder elements in plants may thus prove useful when combined with a detailed geophysical model. Tl, Zn, Pb and Ag concentrations in topsoil identified the surface mineralization but failed to identify the deep mineralization. This difference between samples of S. glauca and topsoil is probably because target elements from the deep mineralization must be mobile to reach the surface. Mobile elements may be more accessible for ion-exchange and uptake into the plants compared to the recalcitrant and crystalline fraction in the topsoil.","output":"Test of vegetation-based surface exploration for detection of Arctic mineralizations: the deep buried Kangerluarsuk Zn-Pb-Ag anomaly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several observations indicate a hyperinflammatory state in severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Machine learning models were used to predict depression risk and to select models with the best performance for each pandemic phase. Probability thresholds were chosen based on cost-sensitive analysis, and measures such as accuracy (ACC) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the models? performance.Results:The study found that decision tree models and regularised regressions had the best performance in both 2020 and 2021. For the 2020 predictions, the highest accuracies were obtained using gradient boosting machines (ACC = 0.72, AUC = 0.74) and random forest algorithm (ACC = 0.71, AUC = 0.75). For the 2021 predictions, the random forest (ACC = 0.76, AUC = 0.78) and elastic net regularisation (ACC = 0.76, AUC = 0.78) exhibited the best performances.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the influence of reduced passive ADF-ROM on the pelvic and lower limb movements and spatiotemporal parameters during gait? METHOD: Thirty-two participants divided into two groups according to the degree of passive ADF-ROM-less than 10 (lower ADF-ROM group) or greater than 15 (higher ADF-ROM group) -were subjected to gait assessment using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Independent t-tests were used to compare the pelvic and lower limb movements and spatiotemporal gait parameters between the groups on this cross-sectional study.

In Alberta, two novel approaches were created in Spring 2020 to remotely support patients with complex neurological conditions and rehabilitation needs. The first approach is a telehealth service that provides wayfinding and self-management advice to Albertans with physical concerns related to existing neurological or musculoskeletal conditions or post-COVID-19 recovery needs. The second approach is a webinar series aimed at supporting self-management and social connectedness of individuals living with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short- and long- term impacts and sustainability of two virtual modalities aimed at advancing self-management, connectedness and rehabilitation needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: We will use a mixed-methods evaluation approach. Evaluation of both approaches will include one-on-one semi-structured interviews and surveys. The evaluation of the telehealth initiative will include secondary data analyses as well as analysis of call data using artificial intelligence. The evaluation of the webinar series will include analysis of poll questions collected during the webinars as well as YouTube analytics data. RESULTS: The proposed study describes unique pandemic virtual modalities and our approaches to evaluating them to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Implementing and evaluating these virtual modalities synchronously allows for the building of knowledge on the complementarity of these methods. At the time of submission, we have completed qualitative and quantitative data collection for the telehealth evaluation. For the webinar series, so far we have distributed the evaluation survey following three webinars and have conducted five attendee interviews. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, understanding the impact and sustainability of the proposed telehealth modalities is important. The results of the evaluation will provide data that can be actioned and serve to improve other telehealth modalities in the future since health systems need this information to make decisions on resource allocation, especially in an uncertain pandemic climate. Evaluating the RAL and AB-SCILS to ensure their effectiveness demonstrates that Alberta Health Services and the health system cares about ensuring best practice even after a shift to primarily virtual care.","output":"Evaluating Community-Facing Virtual Modalities to Support Complex Neurological Populations during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of accurate information on the prevalence and causes of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) in low income countries. The WHO prevalence estimate does not help plan services for specific national income levels or countries. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence, impact, causes and factors associated with musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi. We wished to undertake a national cluster randomized survey of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi, one of the UN Least Developed Countries (LDC), that involved a reliable sampling methodology with a case definition and diagnostic criteria that could clearly be related to the classification system used in the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) METHODS: A sample size of 1,481 households was calculated using data from the latest national census and an expected prevalence based on similar surveys conducted in Rwanda and Cameroon. We randomly selected clusters across the whole country through probability proportional to size sampling with an urban/rural and demographic split that matched the distribution of the population. In the field, randomization of households in a cluster was based on a ground bottle spin. All household members present were screened, and all MSI cases identified were examined in more detail by medical students under supervision, using a standardized interview and examination protocol. Data collection was carried out from 1st July to 30th August 2016. Extrapolation was done based on study size compared to the population of Malawi. MSI severity was classified using the parameters for the percentage of function outlined in the WHO International Classification of Functioning (ICF). A loss of function of 5C24% was mild, 25C49% was moderate and 50C90% was severe. The Malawian version of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used, and EQ-5D index scores were calculated using population values from Zimbabwe, as a population value set for Malawi is not currently available. Chi-square test was used to test categorical variables. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, location and education. RESULTS: A total of 8,801 individuals were enumerated in 1,481 households. Of the 8,548 participants that were screened and examined (response rate of 97.1%), 810 cases of MSI were diagnosed of which 18% (108) had mild, 54% (329) had moderate and 28% (167) had severe MSI as classified by ICF. There was an overall prevalence of MSI of 9.5% (CI 8.9C10.1). The prevalence of MSI increased with age, and was similar in men (9.3%) and women (9.6%). People without formal education were more likely to have MSI [13.3% (CI 11.8C14.8)] compared to those with formal education levels [8.9% (CI 8.1C9.7), p<0.001] for primary school and [5.9% (4.6C7.2), p<0.001] for secondary school. Overall, 33.2% of MSIs were due to congenital causes, 25.6% were neurological in origin, 19.2% due to acquired non-traumatic non-infective causes, 16.8% due to trauma and 5.2% due to infection. Extrapolation of these findings indicated that there are approximately one million cases of MSI in Malawi that need further treatment. MSI had a profound impact on quality of life. Analysis of disaggregated quality of life measures using EQ-5D showed clear correlation with the ICF class. A large proportion of patients with moderate and severe MSI were confined to bed, unable to wash or undress or unable to perform usual daily activities. CONCLUSION: This study has uncovered a high prevalence of MSI in Malawi and its profound impact on a large proportion of the population. These findings suggest that MSI places a considerable strain on social and financial structures in this low-income country. The Quality of Life of those with severe MSI is considerably affected. The huge burden of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi is mostly unattended, revealing an urgent need to scale up surgical and rehabilitation services in the country.","output":"Prevalence, causes and impact of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi: A national cluster randomized survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs) containing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (P(VDF-co-HFP)) copolymers are rare.

We undertook a review of published data/studies on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, as well as serological studies, and studies of infections in the school setting to examine those issues. Those sources suggest significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults, for elevated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y, and for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with sleeping close to an infected individual. Those sources also suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Additionally, there is evidence of robust spread of SARS-CoV-2 in high schools, and more limited spread in primary schools. Some countries with relatively large class sizes in primary schools (e.g. Chile and Israel) reported sizeable outbreaks in some of those schools, though the amount of transmission occurring in these schools (vs. outside) is not clear from current reports. Nonetheless, these reports suggest that classroom crowding and other factors related to social distancing in classrooms/schools may play a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in primary schools. Those findings should have implications for school openings in different age groups of children, and they suggest the need to better protect adults over the age of 60 during the community spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"On the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households, schools and the community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Due to social distancing guidelines and the displacement of both human and material resources to fight the covid-19 pandemic, individuals seeking healthcare services face certain challenges Immunization programs have already been a worrisome topic for health authorities due to declines in vaccine uptake rates and are now especially affected by the covid-19 pandemic Disbelief in science, dissemination of fake news about vaccines, socioeconomic vulnerability and social inequality are some of the challenges faced This commentary article discusses the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on immunization programs in Brazil In light of advances (and notability) of Brazil&#039;s national immunization program, established in the 1970s, the programs face challenges, such as the recent drop in vaccine uptake rates In addition to this health crisis, there is also Brazil&#039;s current political crisis, which will undoubtedly require assistance from researchers, policymakers and society to be fixed","output":"Covid-19 and its impact on immunization programs: reflections from Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil -defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear SternCVolmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2Cspike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2Cspike protein binding.

Intensivists are physicians specializing in providing care in the ICU. Although studies have explored the clinical and financial benefits associated with the use of intensivists, little is known about the organizational and market factors associated with a hospital administrator's strategic decision to use intensivists. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to use the resource dependence theory to better understand the organizational and market factors associated with a hospital administrator's decision to use intensivists. METHODOLOGY: The sample consisted of the national acute care hospitals (N = 4,986) for the period 2007-2017. The dependent variable was the number of full-time equivalent intensivists staffed in hospitals. The independent variables were organizational and market-level factors. A negative binomial regression model with state and year fixed effects, clustered at the hospital level, was used to examine the relationship between the use of intensivists and organizational and market factors. RESULTS: The results from the analyses show that administrators of larger, not-for-profit hospitals that operate in competitive urban markets with relatively high levels of munificence are more likely to utilize intensivists. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When significant strains are placed on ICUs like what was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that hospital administrators understand how to best staff their ICUs.

Remote learning has followed social distancing protocols and helped in continuation of education. However, in children with mental health disorders (C-MHD), the outcomes of online learning are not similar to normal individuals. The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of psychological distress of transitioning to remote learning in C-MHD. The secondary objective is to provide directions to increase student satisfaction for online education. Methods: An IRB-approved cross-sectional analysis was done on children aged 5 to 17 years (N = 172), including 87 boys (50.6%) and 85 girls (49.4%), from January to May 2021, at South Bronx Community Hospital, NY. A total of 111 children were Hispanic (65%) and 53 were African American (31%). Structured questionnaires were used by residents/fellows to determine effects of remote learning on children. A 2 test was used to analyze the data, and p values were calculated across the variables of remote learning and psychiatric diagnosis of MDD, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Results: Our analysis showed that 105 (61%) of C-MHD students struggled to learn remotely compared to in-person learning (more children with MDD [20.35%, p < 0.05] as compared to GAD and ADHD). Due to long screen hours, more felt distracted (37%) than tired (14.5%). More felt sad (17%) than happy (0.06%), and 21.5% felt anxious. More children with GAD (42% vs 27%) as compared to MDD (35% vs 24%), rated e-learning as good. More children with ADHD (35% vs 30.6%) did not like e-learning. More children with MDD (26%, p < 0.05) reported feeling safe from COVID-19 in e-learning than did children with GAD (23%) and ADHD (17%). Conclusions: During the pandemic, C-MHD patients presenting to the emergency department with anxiety, aggression, and irritability have increased dramatically, where one of the main precipitating stressors was the inability to transition to remote learning. Online education during the pandemic has caused severe psychological and behavioral impacts on children.

The natural passenger domain of autotransporters can be replaced by heterologous proteins that become displayed at the bacterial surface by the translocator domain.

The chest CT presentations of APE included massive, segmental, and sub-segmental APE. The need for Intensive Care Unit admission was higher among patients diagnosed with APE, who presented a fatality rate of 10%.. Our study pointed to the incidence and predictors of APE in COVID-19 patients. High levels of D-dimer, CRP, cardiac troponin, and LDH should alert the clinician to the possibility of APE in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The incidence of acute pulmonary embolism with COVID-19 pneumonia in Saudi Arabia: A retrospective single-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to evaluate the circulation of the different human rhinovirus (HRV) species and genotypes in Italian children with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from 643 children admitted to hospital because of CAP during five consecutive winter and early spring seasons (2007-2012). Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify HRV, and the HRV-positive samples were used for sequencing analysis and to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. HRV was identified in 198 samples (42.2%), and the VP4/VP2 region was successfully amplified in 151 (76.3%). HRV-A was identified in 78 samples (51.6%), HRV-B in 14 (9.3%) and HRV-C in 59 (39.1%). Forty-seven (31.1%) of the children with HRV infection were aged <1 year, 71 (47.0%) were aged 1-3 years, and 33 (21.9%) were aged 4 years. Blast and phylogenetic analyses showed that the HRV strains were closely related to a total of 66 reference genotypes, corresponding to 29 HRV-A, 9 HRV-B and 28 HRV-C strains. Nucleotide variability was 37% between HRV-A and HRV-B, 37.3% between HRV-A and HRV-C, and 39.9% between HRV-B and HRV-C. A number of sequences clustered with known serotypes and, within these clusters, there were strains circulating during several seasons. The most frequently detected genotypes were HRV-A78 (n=17), HRV-A12 (n=9) and HRV-C2 (n=5). This study shows that, although it is mainly associated with HRV-A, pediatric CAP can also be diagnosed in subjects infected by HRV-C and, more rarely, by HRV-B. Moreover, a large number of genotypes may be involved in causing pediatric CAP and can be different from year to year. Although the prolonged circulation of the same genotypes can sometimes be associated with a number of CAP episodes in different years.","output":"Phylogenetic Analysis of Human Rhinovirus Isolates Collected from Otherwise Healthy Children with Community-Acquired Pneumonia during Five Successive Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused a transformation of virtually all aspects of the world order today Due to the introduction of the world quarantine, a considerable share of professional communications has been transformed into a format of distance interaction As a result, the specific weight of traditional components of the investment attractiveness of a region is steadily going down, because modern business can be built without the need for territorial unity It should be stated that now the criteria according to which investors decide if they are ready to invest in a region are dynamically transforming The significance of the following characteristics is increasingly growing: the sustainable development of a region, qualities of the social environment, and consistency of the social infrastructure Thus, the approaches to evaluating the regions investment attractiveness must be transformed Moreover, the investment process at the federal level involves the determination of target areas of regional development Despite the universal significance of innovative development, the region can develop much more dynamically when a complex external environment is formed that complements its development model Interregional interaction, as well as an integrated approach to innovative development, taking into account not only the momentary effect, but also the qualitative long-term transformation of the region, will significantly increase the return on investment At the same time, the currently existing methods for assessing the investment attractiveness of the region are usually heuristic in nature and are not universal The heuristic nature of the existing methods does not allow to completely abstract from the subjectivity of the researcher Moreover, the existing methods do not take into account the cyclical properties of the innovative development of the region, which lead to the formation of a long-term effect from the transformation of the regional environment This study is aimed at forming a comprehensive methodology that can be used to evaluate the investment attractiveness of a certain region and conclude about the lines of business that should be developed in it as well as to find ways to increase the regions investment attractiveness According to the results of the study, a comprehensive methodology was formed to evaluate the regions investment attractiveness It consists of three key indicators, namely, the level of the regions investment attractiveness, the projected level of the regions investment attractiveness, and the development vector of the regions investment attractiveness This methodology is based on a set of indicators that consider the status of the economic and social environment of the region, as well as the status of the innovative and ecological environment The methodology can be used to make multi-dimensional conclusions both about the growth areas responsible for increasing the regions innovative attractiveness and the lines of business that should be developed in the region","output":"A Transformation of the Approach to Evaluating a Regions Investment Attractiveness as a Consequence of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Circulation of seasonal nonCsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory viruses with syndromic overlap during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may alter the quality of COVID-19 surveillance, with possible consequences for real-time analysis and delay in implementation of control measures. METHODS: Using a multipathogen susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory virus, we assessed how an outbreak of secondary virus may affect 2 COVID-19 surveillance indicators: testing demand and positivity. Using simulation, we assessed to what extent the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can help correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity and improve surveillance quality. RESULTS: We find that a nonCSARS-CoV-2 epidemic strongly increases SARS-CoV-2 daily testing demand and artificially reduces the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity for the duration of the outbreak. We estimate that performing 1 multiplex test for every 1000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that cocirculating respiratory viruses can distort SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.","output":"The Impact of Cocirculating Pathogens on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/Coronavirus Disease 2019 Surveillance: How Concurrent Epidemics May Introduce Bias and Decrease the Observed SARS-CoV-2 Percentage Positivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged professors and students of all disciplines to adjust quickly to remote online teaching and education platforms In this new era of remote teaching, a greater challenge has been presented in the field of equine science;how to effectively share knowledge that is most often demonstrated by providing students access to live, in-person animal examples Historically, students and teachers believed skill sets, which are vital for future careers in the industry (e g , veterinarian) must be learned through hands-on experience However, in-person methods were not available, so students were taught through the Zoom platform Students enrolled in various levels of equine science classes were invited to complete a short voluntary questionnaire measuring their response and perception to equine courses taught in an entirely online remote setting by the same professor One group was comprised of undergraduates majoring in the field (n = 44) in upper level equine science courses, Advanced Equine Reproduction Physiology and/or Equine Enterprise These students, 41 females and 3 males, ranged in age from 20 to 25 yr, were provided a voluntary questionnaire seeking responses related to the perceived effectiveness and individual preferences of in-class lectures and in-person labs vs remote online teaching practices A similar questionnaire was offered on a volunteer basis to precollege students (n = 17) These students, female, high-school students from freshman to senior status (14-18 yr of age), were interested in equine science as a major at UC Davis in the future This questionnaire evaluated their response to a 2-week remote synchronous online equine science course, which included multiple teaching methods, including lectures, mini labs, and full labs Responses from both populations suggested that equine courses were perceived as effective when offered as online, remote courses Live (synchronous) classes and labs offered on Zoom increased engagement and interaction, but students also appreciated the opportunity to access recorded materials Students responded positively to online remote teaching and found courses to be effective for increasing their knowledge about equine science in an engaging manner, despite their continued preference for in-person instruction","output":"Back in the saddle: student response to remote online equine science classes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 health emergency has demonstrated the need for developing structured telemedicine systems to protect citizens from the spread of the virus.

Southeast Asia, one of the first regions to be affected by the outbreak, is of particular interest given its proximity and close links to China, experience with recent epidemics (i.e. SARS), and the variable course of the outbreak in the region thus far. The aim of this study was to systemically review and assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms in the general adult population, frontline and general healthcare workers (HCWs), and adult students in Southeast Asia during the course of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Several literature databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and medRxiv) were systemically searched for articles published up to February 2021. Two reviewers independently evaluated all the relevant studies using pre-determined criteria and assessed the risk of bias for each included study. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were estimated using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results: In total, 32 samples from 25 studies with 20,352 participants were included. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in all 25 studies and depressive symptoms in 15 studies with pooled prevalence rates of 22% and 16% respectively. Only two studies evaluated insomnia, whose prevalence was estimated to be 19%. The overall prevalence of mental health disorders was similar amongst frontline HCWs (18%), general HCWs (17%), and students (20%) whilst being noticeably higher in the general population (27%). Conclusions: The results indicate that a considerable proportion of participants report the presence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. However, the pooled prevalence rates in Southeast Asia are significantly lower than those reported in other meta-analyses from other areas such as China and Europe.

DesignThis is a cohort study, including PLHIV diagnosed, hospitalized, or requiring intensive services for COVID-19. MethodsData sources include routine electronic medical record or claims data from the U.S. and Spain. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history are described. ResultFour data sources had a population of HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients ranging from 288 to 4606 lives. PLHIV diagnosed with COVID-19 were younger than HIV-negative patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

DESIGN: Web search and review of websites providing DIY braces. SETTING: Leeds, UK. METHODS: A Web search was completed in November 2020 and April 2021 of all companies providing DIY braces for UK consumers. Each website was evaluated, and the following data collected: name; year started operating; costs; process; involvement of a dental professional; average treatment length; retention; consent process; information on risks and benefits; aligner material; social media presence; age suitability; and consumer ratings on Trustpilot. Quality of website information was assessed via the DISCERN tool. RESULTS: Seven DIY orthodontic companies were operating in the UK. Websites reviewed revealed the following: product costs were in the range of 799C1599, treatment length quotes were in the range of 4C12 months; Trustpilot reviews were in the range of 1.6C4.8 stars; and websites claimed their aligners were suitable for individuals with an age range of 12C18 years.

MATERIAL Retrospective analytical study of the concentrations of IRT in NB with a positive neonatal screen for CF born in a tertiary hospital during an 8-year period RESULTS: A total of 790 NB with a positive neonatal screen for CF were analysed. Of these 86.3% were term, 53% girls, and 11.8% were admitted. The mean IRT value was 79.16 ng/mL (range 60 - 367). Significantly higher concentrations of IRT were found in those affected by CF compared to the other groups (P<.001). There were higher levels in large prematures (P=.007) and admitted patients (P=.002). There were no differences as regards gender or season. There was a direct correlation of 64% (P=.001) between IRT and sweat test in those affected by CF and CFSPID.

To understand this, it was observed that different morphologies were formed depending on the manufacturing method used. RJS fibers presented a particular topography with rough fibers, which allowed for better cellular growth and cell spreading in vitro around and into a three-dimensional (3D) mesh, while fibers made by ES were more smooth and cellular growth was only measured on the 3D mesh surface. The fibers with incorporated nHap/CNT nanoparticles enhanced in vitro cell performance as indicated by more cellular proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, proliferation, and deposition of calcium. Greater bone neoformation occurred by combining three characteristics: the presence of nHap and CNT nanoparticles, the topography of the RJS fibers, and the addition of BMMSCs. RJS fibers with nanoparticles and seeded with BMMSCs showed 10a?136 mm3 of bone neoformation, meaning a 10-fold increase compared to using RJS only and BMMSCs (0.853 mm3) and a 5-fold increase from using ES only (2054 mm3) after 6 weeks of implantation. Conversely, none of these approaches used individually showed any significant difference for in vivo bone neoformation, suggesting that their combination is essential for optimizing bone formation. In summary, our work generated a potential material composed of well-defined combinations of suitable scaffolds seeded with BMMSCs for enhancing numerous orthopedic tissue engineering applications.","output":"Rotary Jet-Spun Polycaprolactone/Hydroxyapatite and Carbon Nanotube Scaffolds Seeded with Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Increase Bone Neoformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The IMR 2020: 16th International Conference on Interdisciplinary Management Research is highlighted The conference aims to bring together academic scientists, research scholars, and practitioners to exchange and share their research results and (business) experiences on all aspects of Management and related fields It is an interdisciplinary platform for academic scholars, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent trends and concerns, as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the field of Management as well as in the areas The IMR 2020 particularly welcomes the PhD students in order to provide them an opportunity to present and discuss their research as well as to get a reaction on the work they are doing by fellow PhD students, as well as academic scholars and practitioners The conference's environment is friendly and relaxed and offers a chance for PhD students to network with academics and practitioners to develop their professional relationships","output":"Interdisciplinary Management Research Conference - Imr 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infrared neural stimulation, or INS, uses pulsed infrared light to yield label-free neural stimulation with broad experimental and translational utility. Despite its robust demonstration, INS's mechanistic and biophysical underpinnings have been the subject of debate for more than a decade. The role of lipid membrane thermodynamics appears to play an important role in how fast IR-mediated heating nonspecifically drives action potential generation. Direct observation of lipid membrane dynamics during INS remains to be shown in a live neural model system. We used hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS) microscopy to study biochemical signatures of high-speed vibrational dynamics underlying INS in a live neural cell culture model. Findings suggest that lipid bilayer structural changes are occurring during INS in vitro in NG108-15 neuroglioma cells. Lipid-specific signatures of cell SRS spectra varied with stimulation energy and radiant exposure. Spectroscopic observations agree with high-speed ratiometric fluorescence imaging of a conventional lipophilic membrane structure reporter, di-4-ANNEPS. Overall, the presented findings support the hypothesis that INS causes changes in the lipid membrane of neural cells by changing lipid membrane packing order.

This study quantitatively assessed the effects of changes in resource allocation on the efficiency of trauma, specifically the number of operations performed per defined trauma session. METHODS Trauma lists were reviewed pre-COVID, at the peak and at the tail of the first wave of COVID-19 infections at a hospital in the UK. Efficiency was calculated before and after the reallocation of resources and this was defined as the number of cases per trauma session as well as turnaround times for each part of the surgical patient journey. RESULTS The mean trauma list efficiency was 1.73 cases per session in February 2020 compared to 1.89 in February 2019. It reduced to 1.21 during the COVID peak in April 2020 compared to 1.90 in April 2019 and improved to 1.48 per session in June 2020 vs 1.82 in June 2019.

Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate that large cities are proportionally more affected by COVID-19, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with 0.57% increase in the number of cases per capita and 0.25% in the number of deaths per capita. The difference between the scaling of cases and deaths indicates the case fatality rate decreases with city size. The latest estimates show that a 1% increase in population associates with a 0.14% reduction in the case fatality rate of COVID-19; however, this urban advantage has decreased over time. We interpret this to be due to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas.

We hypothesized that salivary antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the population. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology and tested 167 saliva and 324 serum samples, including 134 and 118 negative saliva and serum samples, respectively, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 33 saliva and 206 serum samples from participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated the correlation of results obtained in saliva vs. serum and determined the sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic media, stratified by antibody isotype, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 case designation for all specimens. Matched serum and saliva SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG responses were significantly correlated. Within the 10-plex SARS-CoV-2 panel, the salivary anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (100% sensitivity at 10 days post-SARS-CoV-2 symptom onset). The salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response resulted in 100% specificity. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT-PCR, the temporal kinetics of IgG, IgA, and IgM in saliva were consistent with those observed in serum. SARS-CoV-2 appears to trigger a humoral immune response resulting in the almost simultaneous rise of IgG, IgM and IgA levels both in serum and in saliva, mirroring responses consistent with the stimulation of existing, cross-reactive B cells.

OBJECTIVE: The current study aims at determining how social media affects the spread of panic about COVID-19 among primary and secondary school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS: The data were collected through an online questionnaire. By utilizing convenience sampling, we have reached a total of 1067 school students, aged between 6 and 18 years, from 56 schools located in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. Independent Samples T-test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests were used to compare the data. RESULTS: The results showed that social media has a significant impact on spreading panic about COVID-19 among school students, with a potential negative impact on their mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most common social media platform among students (81.8%), where female students had a higher likelihood than male students to use it to get news about COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Health news was the most frequently topic seen, read, or heard (n = 529, 56.2%) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where males were more likely to follow health news than females (p < 0.001).

RESULTS: On FFL findings, 10/38 patients (26,31%) had unilateral vocal fold paralysis; on TLUSG results, 9/38 patients (23.68%) presented impaired vocal fold motion. In comparison to laryngoscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TLUSG for assessment of vocal fold mobility was 80%, 96.42%, 88.88%, 93.10% respectively. A significant association between the two techniques was found on the Chi-square test: X2 = 19.7722 (p value <0.00001). Cohen's K value showed a substantial agreement: K = 0,79. CONCLUSION: Although TLUSG could undoubtedly not replace laringoscopy, it represents a noninvasive and useful diagnostic tool for otolaryngologists especially during covid-19 pandemic.Data collected about its high sensitivity and specificity suggest that TLUSG could be a reliable method to screen vocal fold paralysis without performing aerosol-generating procedures, thus providing clear visualization of laryngeal real-time movements, even in non-compliant or high-risk infection patients. Our results allow us to consider TLUSG as part of the preoperative assessment of vocal folds in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","output":"Transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography: A promising tool for otolaryngologists during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The beginning of the twenty-first century saw an apparent change in language in public discourses characterised by the rise of so-called \\"essentially oxymoronic concepts\\", i.e., mainly oxymora and paradoxes. In earlier times, these rhetorical figures of speech were largely reserved for the domain of literature, the arts or mysticism. Today, however, many new technologies and other innovations are contributing to their rise also in the domains of science and of law. Particularly in law, their inherent contradictory quality of combining apparently antagonistic suppositions challenges the traditional dualistic mode of reasoning and binary logic. As reflected in terms like fake news, alternative facts or conspiracy theories, these concepts are seen as a threat to the rule of law and legal certainty and have been described as harbingers of an age of disinformation or post-truth. The challenge posed by these apparently contradictory concepts requires a closer look at the premises that guide our legal thinking and a more integrated theory of the senses and their role in law, as captured by the terms \\"legal synaesthesia\\" and \\"legal semiotics\\".

This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to 2 months into social distancing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional convenience sample. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1684 Australians aged 18-65 years who drink at least monthly. MEASUREMENTS: Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). FINDINGS: Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample [2019 score = 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.9-8.4; during the pandemic = 7.3, 95% CI = 7.1-7.6]. Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (? = 0.65, P = 0.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall.

Unprecedented public health actions were introduced, including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine. The Belgian government announced a national emergency plan, thereby postponing all non-urgent medical consultations and operations. This report analyses the impact of these measures on cancer screening, through assessment of the workload of a laboratory for histopathology and cytopathology. METHODS: Data on monthly numbers of histological and cytological samples, immunohistochemistry and molecular tests were extracted from the laboratory information management system. RESULTS: The global histopathological and cytological workload was substantially reduced. The impact on oncology-related surgical procedures was rather limited. The anti-COVID-19 measures significantly diminished all screening-related samples, such as colon biopsies, breast biopsies and cervical cytology, and strongly reduced the number of samples related to functional pathology, such as thyroidectomies and gastric biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Since many health care interventions are reflected in the workload of a pathology laboratory, this study enabled us to identify areas for deconfinement health care actions. Our findings indicate that various areas in medicine were affected, but the impact seemed largest for cancer screening. Health care professionals should assure that consultations related to cancer screening are postponed instead of cancelled.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Associated Belgian Governmental Measures on Cancer Screening, Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is fighting the onslaught of COVID 19 for the last 10 months, ever since the first case was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Now, it has spread to over 200 countries. COVID 19-associated respiratory syndrome is causing a lot of mortality and morbidity. There are reports suggesting that the complications and ARDS associated with COVID 19 is an immune response reaction. The cytokine storm associated with severe cases of COVID 19 acts as a cause of death in many sick patients. It has been shown that COVID 19 is associated with a peculiar immune profile: Decrease in CD3, CD4, CD8, natural killer cell and B-cells; Rise in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; Decrease in IL-10; Decrease in interferon-gamma. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) immunosuppressive features resulting from M2 macrophage phenotype activation, increase in IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, a decrease in IL-6, TNF alpha and an increase in CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell counts may negate the harmful effects of cytokine release syndrome. Literature review shows that radiation was previously used to treat viral pneumonia with a good success rate. This practice was discontinued in view of the availability of effective antibiotics and antivirals. As there are no scientifically proven treatment for severe COVID 19-associated respiratory distress today, it is prudent that we understand the benefits of LDRT at this critical juncture and take rational decisions to treat the same.

Introduction: The outbreak rapidly spread to more than 200 countries and led to millions of confirmed cases as well as thousands of deaths worldwide. This makes a serious threat to the world in terms of public health. The present study aimed to compare the COVID-19 epidemic parameters in Turkey with the top ten countries that reported the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide on April 25, 2020. Plus, it might provide better insight into the efficacy of national interventions on the course of the disease by measuring the case-fatality rate. Methods: A detailed search of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering official websites, and announcements were conducted between January 22 and April 25, 2020. COVID-19 related datasets for the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results: Although the growth rate sharply increased by more than 1.2% in the late January 2020, the cumulative number of cases remained below 1,500 around the world. The epidemic growth curve in Turkey was very similar to the US and Italy during the period. The case-fatality rate in Turkey was 2.51%, which below the countries with the most cases, except Russia, and the recovery-death ratio appeared to be at a moderate level among these countries. Conclusions: Since there are no standard treatments for the disease, it is important to avoid infection or further spreading.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify regions critical for stability: the heptad repeat region 1, the SD1 domain and position 614 in SD2. We combine a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation.

Parents with a child admitted to the hospital may also experience hospital-based food insecurity, defined as the inability of caregivers to afford adequate food during their childs hospitalization. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to measure the prevalence of household and hospital-based food insecurity in an academic pediatric hospital setting during the COVD-19 pandemic. We also explored the effects of food insecurity on parental distress and overall caregivers experiences obtaining food during their hospital stay. DESIGN/METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study from April to October 2020. Household food insecurity was measured using the 18-item U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module. Three adapted questions about hospital-based food insecurity were added. Parental distress was measured with the validated Distress Thermometer for Parents: 0 indicates no distress and 10 indicates extreme distress. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the proportions of food insecurity. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between food insecurity and parental distress adjusted for potential confounders. To explore caregivers experiences we included one open-ended question in our survey, asking: Do you have any other feedback regarding your food situation during your childs hospital admission?. Recurrent themes were identified using qualitative analysis. RESULTS: 851 families were reached by telephone and 775 (91.0%) provided consent to participate. 435 (56.1%) completed at least one questionnaire [Figure 1 Study Flow Diagram]. Caregivers described a high prevalence of household (34.2%) and hospital-based (38.0%) food insecurity. Both adult (B= 0.21 [95% CI 0.07-0.36]), child (B= 0.38 [95% CI 0.10-0.66]) and hospital-based (B= 0.56 [95% CI 0.30-0.83]) food insecurity were significantly associated with parental distress independent of covariates [Table]. In the qualitative analysis, the financial burden and emotional and practical barriers obtaining food in the hospital were identified as important themes. Parents also commented that they need to eat to be able to take part in the care of their child during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Both household and hospital-based food insecurity were highly prevalent in caregivers and significantly associated with parental distress, independent of covariates. High parental distress is known to be associated with a childs maladjustment to illness and adherence with medical treatment. Hospitals need to strongly consider reducing barriers for parents to obtain food for themselves during their childs admission in order to reduce parental distress.

Such disorders may have enduring impacts on employment, social participation, and quality of life. Technology-enabled interventions such as mobile apps have the potential to increase the reach of speech-language therapy to treat communication disorders. However, ensuring that apps are evidence-based and of high quality is critical for facilitating safe and effective treatment for adults with communication disorders. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to identify mobile apps that are currently widely available to adults with communication disorders for speech-language therapy and to assess their content and quality using the validated Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). METHODS: Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and webpages were searched to identify mobile apps for speech-language therapy. Apps were included in the review if they were designed for the treatment of adult communication disorders after ABI, were in English, and were either free or for purchase. Certified speech-language pathologists used the MARS to assess the quality of the apps. RESULTS: From a total of 2680 apps identified from Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and web searches, 2.61% (70/2680) apps met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Overall, 61% (43/70) were available for download on the iPhone Operating System (iOS) platform, 20% (14/70) on the Android platform, and 19% (13/70) on both iOS and Android platforms. A content analysis of the apps revealed 43 apps for language, 17 apps for speech, 8 apps for cognitive communication, 6 apps for voice, and 5 apps for oromotor function or numeracy. The overall MARS mean score was 3.7 out of 5, SD 0.6, ranging between 2.1 and 4.5, with functionality being the highest-scored subscale (4.3, SD 0.6), followed by aesthetics (3.8, SD 0.8), information (3.4, SD 0.6), and engagement (3.3, SD 0.6).

We hypothesize that distinct bacterial-fungal interactions differentially influence host mucosal immune response. Thus, we investigated in vitro and in vivo interactions between Malassezia sympodialis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. The in vitro interactions were evaluated using the modified Kirby-Bauer Assay, Crystal Violet assay for biofilm, and FISH. A pilot murine model of acute sinusitis was used to investigate relationships with the host immune response. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were intranasally instilled in the presence or absence of M. sympodialis (n = 66 total mice; 3C5/group). Changes in the microbiota were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and host immune response was measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In vitro, only late stage planktonic P. aeruginosa and its biofilms inhibited M. sympodialis. Co-infection of mice with M. sympodialis and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus differently influenced the immune response. In co-infected mice, we demonstrate different expression of fungal sensing (Dectin-1), allergic responses (IL-5, and IL-13) and inflammation (IL-10, and IL-17) in murine sinus depending on the bacterial species that co-infected with M. sympodialis (p < 0.05). The pilot results suggest that species-specific interactions in airway-associated microbiota may be implicated driving immune responses. The understanding of the role of bacterial-fungal interactions in CRS will contribute to development of novel therapies toward manipulation of the airway microbiota.","output":"Co-infection of Malassezia sympodialis With Bacterial Pathobionts Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus Leads to Distinct Sinonasal Inflammatory Responses in a Murine Acute Sinusitis Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The lockdown period (March?May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe led to a reduction in the anthropogenic emissions of primary pollutants. For three-quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 ?gm?3 (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O3) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O3 concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO2 and O3 toward more O3. The level of total oxidant (Ox = O3?+?NO2) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe. The results illustrate the complexity of the atmospheric response to the unprecedented reduction in the emission of primary pollutants.","output":"Response of surface ozone concentration to emission reduction and meteorology during the COVID-19 lockdown in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disaster preparedness plans reduce future damages, but may lack testing to assess their effectiveness in operation. This study used the state-designed Local Government Unit Disaster Preparedness Journal: Checklist of Minimum Actions for Mayors in assessing the readiness to natural hazards of 92 profiled municipalities in central Philippines inhabited by 2.4 million people. Anchored on the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, it assessed their preparedness in 4 criteria-systems and structures, policies and plans, building competencies, and equipment and supplies. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences, frequency count, percentage, and weighted mean. The local governments were found highly vulnerable to tropical cyclone and flood while vulnerable to earthquake, drought, and landslide. They were partially prepared regardless of profile, but the coastal, middle-earning, most populated, having the least number of villages, and middle-sized had higher levels of preparedness. Those highly vulnerable to earthquake and forest fire were prepared, yet only partially prepared to flood, storm surge, drought, tropical cyclone, tornado, tsunami and landslide. The diverse attitude of stakeholders, insufficient manpower, and poor database management were the major problems encountered in executing countermeasures. Appointing full-time disaster managers, developing a disaster information management system, massive information drive, organizing village-based volunteers, integrating disaster management into formal education, and mandatory trainings for officials, preparing for a possible major volcanic eruption and crafting a comprehensive plan against emerging emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a 360 preparedness.","output":"Disaster preparedness of local governments in Panay Island, Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted graduate medical education with redistribution of trainees, altered clinical care, and decreased research. For graduating trainees, there remains concern that financial stability of health systems will affect the availability of new positions and hiring practices. This survey aims to evaluate the pandemic's impact from pediatric gastroenterology fellows' perspectives. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed by e-mail from June 11 to July 1, 2020 to all North American pediatric gastroenterology and advanced training fellows. The survey was tailored for the fellows' year of training including questions on education, clinical experience, research, and job outlook. RESULTS: Of the 434 pediatric gastroenterology fellows, 145 completed the survey. Of all respondents, negative impact was reported in 52% on clinical training, 46% research projects, and 41% procedural confidence. A majority (93%) of third-year respondents had a job contract signed at the time of the survey; however, 18% of those contracts were subsequently altered with five respondents having job contracts rescinded due to hiring freezes. Fifty-four percent of first- and second-year fellow respondents reported concern regarding finding a job with the majority being second-year fellows (78%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the medical system and healthcare professionals. This survey identified significant impact on job acquisition for graduating pediatric gastroenterology fellows as well as other critical components of training, which are likely applicable to other pediatric trainees.

Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models.

METHODS Convectional 2.0 polyglyconate suture was used in the control group (CG n = 10) and 2.0 barbed polyglyconate suture in the barbed group (BG n = 10) to perform celiorrhaphy (simple continuous pattern) and subcutaneous closure (continuous intradermal pattern). Data were assessed using paired (leukogram between 24 and 48 h within the same group) and unpaired (leukogram, surgical time, tissue thickness, and costs) Student's t-test. The Fisher exact test was used to assess the occurrence of seroma between groups (p < 0.05). Results are shown as mean  standard error of mean. RESULTS The time spent to perform the celiorrhaphy (195.30  17.37 s vs. 204  16.00 s), subcutaneous closure (174.0  15.86 s vs. 198.0  15.62 s), and the total surgical time (24.30  1.44 min vs. 23.00  1.30 min) did not differ between BG and CG, respectively (p > 0.05). Leukogram at 48 h post-surgery did not differ between groups (p = 0.20). No differences were observed in the subcutaneous and the abdominal wall thickness (cm) assessed by ultrasonography at 48 h in BG (0.31  0.04, 0.80  0.05) and CG (0.34  0.03, 0.72  0.06), respectively.

By merging stakeholder objectives with system uncertainty, and by adapting actions to changing systems and knowledge, adaptive resource management (ARM) provides a rigorous platform for making sound decisions in a changing world. Critically, however, applications of ARM could be improved by employing benchmarks (i.e., points of reference) for determining when learning is occurring through the cycle of monitoring, modeling, and decision\\\\making steps in ARM. Many applications of ARM use multiple model\\\\based hypotheses to identify and reduce systematic uncertainty over time, but generally lack benchmarks for gauging discovery of scientific evidence and learning. This creates the danger of thinking that directional changes in model weights or rankings are indicative of evidence for hypotheses, when possibly all competing models are inadequate. There is thus a somewhat obvious, but yet to be filled niche for including benchmarks for learning in ARM. We contend that carefully designed ecological null models, which are structured to produce an expected ecological pattern in the absence of a hypothesized mechanism, can serve as suitable benchmarks. Using a classic case study of mallard harvest management that is often used to demonstrate the successes of ARM for learning about ecological mechanisms, we show that simple ecological null models, such as population persistence (N(t) (+1) = N(t) ), provide more robust near\\\\term forecasts of population abundance than the currently used mechanistic models. More broadly, ecological null models can be used as benchmarks for learning in ARM that trigger the need for discarding model parameterizations and developing new ones when prevailing models underperform the ecological null model. Identifying mechanistic models that surpass these benchmarks will improve learning through ARM and help decision\\\\makers keep pace with a rapidly changing world.","output":"A niche for null models in adaptive resource management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for the pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Patients were classified into statin-users vs statin non-users based on antecedent use of statins. Multivariable regression analysis was performed adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, insurance, and comorbidities. Propensity score matching was performed to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort.

The classic one, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Angiotensin (Ang) II, promoting vasoconstriction, and the \\"alternative\\" one, including ACE2 and Ang1-7, with opposed actions to AngII. ACE2 has been identified as the main receptor of SARS-CoV2, whereby it enters the cells, leading to the downregulation of surface ACE2 and RAS tissue unbalance. Given that diabetes is associated with an increase in COVID-19 severity and death, we aimed at evaluating RAS expression in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS AND RESULTS This is a case-control study comparing 39 T1D patients to 33 controls, with a median age of 29 and 32 years, and no comorbidities. ACE and ACE2 gene expression was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T1D patients had higher ACE expression and circulating AngII, which were related to glucose levels. T1D patients had lower ACE2 expression. However, ACE2 expression was also related to the sex of participants, being higher in the female group. T1D women did not show the same increase of ACE2 expression that was seen in control women. CONCLUSION T1D promotes the increase of ACE, AngII, and ACE/ACE2, which might contribute to the higher cardiovascular risk, as well as to severe tissue injury induced by SARS-CoV2 in these patients. The ratio ACE/ACE2 does not differ between men and women with T1D, which might explain why CVD or COVID-19 do not show substantial gender differences in these patients.","output":"Type 1 diabetes is associated with significant changes of ACE and ACE2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Austria partly spared its healthcare system from the catastrophic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with an early lockdown.

This review summarizes current epidemiologic data, highlights pathogenetic mechanisms on the association between excess body weight and COVID-19, compares data from previous pandemics, discusses why COVID-19 challenges the \\"obesity paradox,\\" and presents implications in prevention and treatment as well as future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from meta-analyses based on recent observational studies have indicated that obesity increases the risks of infection from SARS-CoV-2, severe infection and hospitalization, admission to the ICU and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and the risk of mortality, particularly in severe obesity. The risks of IMV and mortality associated with obesity are accentuated in younger individuals (age &#8804; 50 years old). The meta-inflammation in obesity intersects with and exacerbates underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19 through the following mechanisms and factors: (i) impaired innate and adaptive immune responses; (ii) chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; (iii) endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and aberrant activation of the complement; (iv) overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; (v) overexpression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the adipose tissue; (vi) associated cardiometabolic comorbidities; (vii) vitamin D deficiency; (viii) gut dysbiosis; and (ix) mechanical and psychological issues. Mechanistic and large epidemiologic studies using big data sources with omics data exploring genetic determinants of risk and disease severity as well as large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to shed light on the pathways connecting chronic subclinical inflammation/meta-inflammation with adverse COVID-19 outcomes and establish the ideal preventive and therapeutic approaches for patients with obesity.","output":"Understanding the Co-Epidemic of Obesity and COVID-19: Current Evidence, Comparison with Previous Epidemics, Mechanisms, and Preventive and Therapeutic Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last half of the 20th century, psychiatry lost many of the conditions needed for unhindered practice.

Thirty-eight of those isolates were recognized as Mass serotype viruses based on their reactivity to Mass-specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) and neutralization by Mass-specific chicken serum. The remaining two isolates, N-M24 and N-M39, that did not react with Mass-specific Mab, resisted neutralization by Mass-specific chicken serum, and were neutralized only by homologous chicken antibody were identified as non-Mass IBV. When the first 900 nucleotides (nt) from the 5'-end of the spike (S1) glycoprotein gene and their deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were compared, the two non-Mass isolates differed from each other by 24% and 28%, respectively. In a similar comparison, the non-Mass viruses N-M24 and N-M39 differed from M28, a Mass-type isolate from the 1940s, by 21% and 22% (nt) and 28% and 27% (aa), respectively. These data indicate that antigenic and genetic diversity among IBV isolates existed even in the 1940s.

From observable data on confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, a noisy measurement for the contact rate can be constructed. To filter out measurement errors and seasonality, a novel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It specifies the log contact rate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order. The fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social behavior such as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information. A computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is termed the fractional filter. It allows to estimate UC models with richer long-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the prediction error of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for several countries are well in line with the chronology of the pandemic, and allow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy interventions. As the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at the end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in real time.","output":"Monitoring the pandemic: A fractional filter for the COVID-19 contact rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a brief overview of the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the impact on trauma and orthopaedic surgeons.

METHODS We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the International Patterns of Opioid Prescribing (iPOP) multicenter study. Patients aged 16 and older who underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or inguinal herniorrhaphy in one of 14 participating hospitals across 8 countries between October 2016 and March 2017 were included. In hospitals where pain severity was assessed using a 0-10 visual analog scale before hospital discharge, patients were stratified into four groups depending on the pain severity: none, mild (1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe (7-10). The number of opioid prescriptions, total number of pills, and oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) prescribed were calculated for each group and a comparison between US and non-US patients was performed. RESULTS A total of 2,024 patients were included. Eighty-three percent of US patients without pain were prescribed opioids compared to 8.7% of non-US patients without pain (p-value <0.001). The number of opioid prescriptions, the number of pills and OMEs prescribed were similar across the four pain severity groups in US patients (p-values >0.05). In contrast, the number of opioid prescriptions and the number of opioid pills and OMEs prescribed among non-US patients were incrementally higher as the pain severity progressed from no pain to severe pain (all p-values <0.05).

Given potential financial challenges and adverse psychosocial effects of campus closure, as done in the spring of 2020 in response to the first wave, many institutions of higher education developed strategies to allow campuses to reopen and operate in the fall despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Many however opted to have limited campus re-opening in order to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in the city of Boston. Design: Multi-faceted intervention case study. Setting: Large urban university campus. Interventions: The BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing facility with capacity to delivery results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; compliance monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine and isolation in on campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; de-densification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems. Main Outcomes and Measures: Between August and December 2020, BU conducted >500,000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19: 627 (87.2%) students, 11 (1.5%) faculty, and 212 (25.5%) staff. Overall, about 1.8% of the BU community tested positive. Infections among faculty and staff were mostly acquired off campus, while undergraduate infections were more likely acquired in non-classroom campus settings. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 (10.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside of BU. Among infected faculty and staff with a known source of infection, the majority reported a transmission source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff). Conclusions and Relevance: BU was successful in containing COVID-19 transmission on campus while minimizing off campus acquisition of COVID-19 from the greater Boston area. A coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, can control COVID-19 transmission, even in an urban university setting.","output":"Control of COVID-19 transmission on an urban university campus during a second wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Non-anatomical liver resection (NAR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are treatment options for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

A propensity score-matching analysis was performed to reduce bias, and outcomes in these patients were analysed. Results From a total of 199 patients, 1:1 propensity score matching identified 70 matched pairs. Patients having NAR had a longer hospital stay (median 10 days versus 4 days for those who had RFA; P < 0001) and a higher morbidity rate (24 versus 10 per cent respectively; P = 0042). Patients who had NAR had slightly better recurrence-free survival but this failed to reach statistical significance in univariable analysis (P = 0064).

OBJECTIVE: To develop effective screening and vaccination strategies, customized for a college campus, to reduce COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and peak hospitalizations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We construct a compartmental model of disease spread under vaccination and routine screening, and study the efficacy of four mitigation strategies (routine screening only, vaccination only, vaccination with partial or full routine screening), and a no-intervention strategy. The study setting is a hypothetical college campus of 5,000 students and 455 faculty members during the Fall 2021 academic semester, when the Delta variant was the predominant strain. For sensitivity analysis, we vary the screening frequency, daily vaccination rate, initial vaccine coverage, and screening and vaccination compliance; and consider scenarios that represent low/medium/high transmission and test efficacy. Model parameters come from publicly available or published sources. RESULTS: With low initial vaccine coverage (30% in our study), even aggressive vaccination and screening result in a high number of infections: 1,020 to 2,040 (1,530 to 2,480) with routine daily (every other day) screening of the unvaccinated; 280 to 900 with daily screening extended to the newly vaccinated in base- and worst-case scenarios, which respectively consider reproduction numbers of 4.75 and 6.75 for the Delta variant. CONCLUSION: Integrated vaccination and routine screening can allow for a safe opening of a college when both the vaccine effectiveness and the initial vaccine coverage are sufficiently high.

However, little is known about pediatricians experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. Methods: Data from a nationally representative survey of AAP post-residency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n=744; response rate=48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which non-users would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. Results: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among non-users, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. Conclusion: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth.

However, regional differences also became apparent and with the second wave of infections, the detailed characterization of COVID-19 patients is crucial to early diagnosis and disruption of chains of infections. METHODS: Handing out detailed questionnaires to all individuals tested for COVID-19, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of negative and positive tested individuals. Expression of symptoms, symptom duration and association between predictor variables (i.e. age, gender) and a binary outcome (olfactory and gustatory dysfunction) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, the most common symptoms among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were fatigue, headache, and cough. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were also reported by many SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals, more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 negative tested individuals in our study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Independent of SARS-CoV-2 status, more females displayed symptoms of gustatory (29.8%, p = 0.0041) and olfactory dysfunction (22.9%, p = 0.0174) compared to men. CONCLUSIONS: Bringing early SARS-CoV-2 tests to the populations at risk must be a main focus for the upcoming months.

Several substitutions at isoleucine 38 in PA protein (e.g., PA-I38T) have been associated with decreased baloxavir susceptibility in vitro and in vivo. In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and pyrosequencing have been used by CDC and U.S. Public Health Laboratories to monitor drug susceptibility of influenza viruses. Here we described an improved pyrosequencing assay for detecting influenza A viruses carrying substitutions at PA-38. Cyclic and customized orders of nucleotide dispensation were evaluated, and pyrosequencing results were compared to those generated using NGS. Our data showed that the customized nucleotide dispensation has improved the pyrosequencing assay performance in identification of double mixtures (e.g., PA-38I/T); however, identification of PA-38 variants in triple mixtures remains a challenge. While NGS analysis indicated the presence of PA-I38K in one clinical specimen and isolate, our attempts to detect this mutation by pyrosequencing or recover the virus carrying PA-I38K in cell culture were unsuccessful, raising a possibility of a rarely occurring sequencing error. Overall, pyrosequencing provides a convenient means to detect baloxavir resistant influenza viruses when NGS is unavailable or a faster turnaround time is required.","output":"Detection of baloxavir resistant influenza A viruses using next generation sequencing and pyrosequencing methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the impact of COVID-19 on the life experiences of essential workers attending a COVID-19 antibody testing clinic at a dental school. 2) To compare responses of dental, non-dental health care, and non-health care essential workers. 3) To assess acceptability/satisfaction of testing done in a dental setting. METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were \\"definitely\\" satisfied, and would \\"definitely\\" recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting.

Methods: Data from 324 medical notes corresponding to rheumatic consultations between July and December 2020 were abstracted. Notes were selected considering a stratified (in-person and telephone consultations) random sampling strategy. QIP, CIP, QTP, and CTP were scored based on prespecified criteria as percentages, where higher numbers translated into better standards. Logistic regression analysis investigated the association between the consultation modality and the treatment recommendation (dependent variable). Results: There were 208 (64.2%) medical notes related to in-person consultations and 114 (35.2%) to telephone consultations. Overall, medical notes corresponded to middle-aged women with long-standing disease. QIP was superior to QTP (median, interquartile range): 60% (60-75%) versus 50% (25-60%), p  0.001, and differences were related to disease activity and prognosis documentation (81.3% vs. 34.5% and 55.8% vs. 33.6%, respectively, p  0.001) and the prolonged prescription of glucocorticoids with a documented management plan (58.5% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.045). Meanwhile, CIP and CTP were similar. Telephone consultation was a significant risk factor for no changes in the treatment recommendation (odds ratio: 2.113, 95% confidence interval: 1.284-3.479, p = 0.003), and results were consistent in the 142 medical notes with documented absence of disease activity.

Methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted in an academic office-based dermatologic surgery practice. All patients consented to research. 'Pre-pandemic' (Nov. 2019 - March 21, 2020) consultations served as controls. Consultations during the 'pause' (March 22 - June 8, 2020) and 'reopening' (June 9 - Sept. 30, 2020) were evaluated for time to treatment, tumor area, and upstaging. One-way ANOVA or Fisher Exact analyses were performed with P &lt; 0.05 significant. Operational changes included (1) modified scheduling, staffing, and rooming;(2) COVID-19 symptom screening;(3) N95 masks and shields for patient contact;(4) triage by tumor acuity;(5) same day or video consultation;and (6) increased utilization of same day biopsy and surgery for suspicious lesions. Results: Data from 698 patients (23-103 yrs of age, avg 71 yrs) yielded 876 tumors treated by Mohs surgery (n = 776), standard excision (n = 73), staged excision (n = 14) or electrodessication and curettage (n = 13). The average time from biopsy or consultation to treatment was faster during the pause and reopening relative to prepandemic (Table). More frozen section diagnostic biopsies were performed in the pause (n = 6) and reopening (n = 4) compared to pre-pandemic (n = 0). Post-operative defects were similar to prepandemic sizes (3.2 cm2 ) during the pause (3.9 cm2 ) and reopening (3.2 cm2 ) (p = 0.72).

In recent times, EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are widely used as a promising medicinal product in many clinical applications, are being tested in many preclinical trials. However, the lack of standardization of MSC-derived EV isolation and analysis methods, restricts the utility of MSC-derived EVs in the clinical setting. Here, we focused on optimising the isolation method for EVs derived from MSCs. Four samples of EVs were isolated from human adipose derived MSC culture medium by differential ultracentrifugation with three different ultracentrifuge durations to investigate the influence of ultracentrifuge time on quality and quantity of MSC-derived EVs. Additionally, we used a commercial kit to extract EVs from MSC cultured medium and compared it with the ultracentrifugation method. The EV samples were then characterised for particle concentration, protein concentration, size distribution and the presence of known EV protein markers, by western blot and flow cytometry. A comparison of these results for the five samples demonstrated that 1a?h of differential ultracentrifugation was optimal to isolate high quality and quantity of MSC-derived EVs from MSC cultured medium. Additionally, fluorescence imaging of the freshly isolated vs frozen EVs showed that freshly isolated EVs are taken up by cells more efficiently than frozen EVs.

The aim was to study differences in outcomes between CS and LS. SETTING Nationwide Swedish cohort. METHODS The Scandinavian Obesity Registry (SOReg) included prospective data from 34,284 primary LRYGB patients operated on in 2007-2013. We studied operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and percent excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL) after 1 year. Outcomes were assessed through multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, age, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. RESULTS Preoperatively the groups were similar (40.9 yr, BMI 42.4 kg/m(2), 76% female).

Better definition of the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of cardiac arrest during hospitalization for COVID-19 may support early identification and intervention. PURPOSE: To estimate the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with COVID-19, describe the temporal trends in incidence of and survival after cardiac arrest, summarise characteristics of those who experienced a cardiac arrest, and compare the characteristics of survivors versus non-survivors of cardiac arrest. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19 to a tertiary medical center comprising three hospitals between March and November 2020. Data entry is ongoing for more than 2000 patients admitted through 2021. Clinical variables extracted via review of electronic medical records included age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, history of cardiovascular disease (ie., coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or cerebrovascular event), other comorbidities included in the Charlson comorbidity index, date of admission, duration of hospitalization, all cardiac arrest events during hospitalization, presenting rhythm during first cardiac arrest, and death. Data were described using summary statistics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations. RESULTS: Among 1666 patients, 107 (6.4%) experienced at least one in-hospital cardiac arrest event during hospitalization for COVID-19, of which 25 (23%) survived to hospital discharge. From March to October 2020, there was a decrease in estimated cardiac arrest incidence in-hospital from 8.2% to 3%, whereas estimated survival to hospital discharge after an arrest remained similar at approximately 20% (Figure). Compared to those who did not, patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest were older and more likely to have existing cardiovascular disease, as well as other comorbidities. Similar factors were associated with lower chance of survival after cardiac arrest (Table). Patients with pulseless ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) as presenting rhythm in cardiac arrest had better survival to hospital discharge compared to those with other rhythms (OR 3.3, p=0.02). Younger age (per 10 years, OR=0.7, p=0.03) and fewer comorbidities (per one fewer comorbidity, OR=1.5, p=0.05) were associated with better survival after cardiac arrest in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSION: There was a decline in estimated incidence of cardiac arrest during hospitalization for COVID-19 since beginning of pandemic, with survival to hospital discharge after cardiac arrest estimated to be stable at around 20%.

Accessibility of electronic health records (EHR) has enabled data-driven predictive modeling using machine learning. However, very few studies rely solely on unstructured clinical notes from the EHR for mortality prediction. In this work, we propose a framework to predict short, mid, and long-term mortality in adult ICU patients using unstructured clinical notes from the MIMIC III database, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) models. Depending on the statistical description of the patients length of stay, we define the short-term as 48-hour and 4-day period, the mid-term as 7-day and 10-day period, and the long-term as 15-day and 30-day period after admission. We found that by only using clinical notes within the 24 hours of admission, our framework can achieve a high area under the receiver operating characteristics (AU-ROC) score for short, mid and long-term mortality prediction tasks. The test AU-ROC scores are 0.87, 0.83, 0.83, 0.82, 0.82, and 0.82 for 48-hour, 4-day, 7-day, 10-day, 15-day, and 30-day period mortality prediction, respectively.

To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits and other PD symptoms affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, resulting in different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than in healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes.

Studies suggest that an on-site champion may improve the quality of care residents' health outcomes. This review assessed the effectiveness of the champion on staff adherence to guidelines and subsequent resident outcomes in LTC homes. METHOD This was a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Eligible studies included residents aged 65 or over and nursing staff in LTC homes where there was a stand-alone or multi-component intervention that used a champion to improve staff adherence to guidelines and resident outcomes. The measured outcomes included staff adherence to guidelines, resident health outcomes, quality of life, adverse events, satisfaction with care, or resource use. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool; evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS After screening 4367 citations, we identified 12 articles that included the results of 1 RCT and 11 cluster-RCTs. All included papers evaluated the effects of a champion as part of a multicomponent intervention. We found low certainty evidence that champions as part of multicomponent interventions may improve staff adherence to guidelines. Effect sizes varied in magnitude across studies including unadjusted risk differences (RD) of 4.1% [95% CI: - 3%, 9%] to 44.8% [95% CI: 32%, 61%] for improving pressure ulcer prevention in a bed and a chair, respectively, RD of 44% [95% CI: 17%, 71%] for improving depression identification and RD of 21% [95% CI: 12%, 30%] for improving function-focused care to residents. CONCLUSION Champions may improve staff adherence to evidence-based guidelines in LTC homes. However, methodological issues and poor reporting creates uncertainty around these findings. It is premature to recommend the widespread use of champions to improve uptake of guideline-based care in LTC without further study of the champion role and its impact on cost.

Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype specific epitopes are located.

METHODS: We studied 198 higher-risk cardiac surgery patients. We allocated patients to four groups: Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)-AKI-negative and NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio-negative (no AKI), KDIGO AKI-negative and NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio-positive (subclinical AKI), KDIGO AKI-positive and NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio-negative (clinical AKI), KDIGO AKI-positive and NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio-positive (combined AKI). Outcomes included in-hospital mortality (primary) and long-term mortality (secondary). RESULTS: We identified 127 (61.6%) patients with no AKI, 13 (6.6%) with subclinical, 40 (20.2%) with clinical and 18 (9.1%) with combined AKI. Subclinical AKI patients had a 23-fold greater in-hospital mortality than no AKI patients. For combined AKI vs. no AKI or clinical AKI, findings were stronger (odds ratios (ORs): 126 and 39, respectively). After adjusting for EuroScore, volume of intraoperative packed red blood cells, and aortic cross-clamp time, subclinical and combined AKI remained associated with greater in-hospital mortality than no AKI and clinical AKI (adjusted ORs: 28.118, 95% CI 1.465C539.703; 3.737, 95% CI 1.746C7.998).

However, most research on sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic focused on heterosexual individuals. The only study so far on men who have sex with men was conducted in the United States. AIM: Our study expands the understanding of sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic by studying gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong. Although sexual desire and sexual activity continue to be important aspects of one's life during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are COVID-19-related barriers to having sex. This study therefore examined the association between sexual desire, COVID-19-related barriers, and whether to engage in sexual activity or not during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 857 cisgender sexual minority people in Hong Kong participated in an online survey study, and for this article, only male participants were included in the analysis, yielding an analytical sample of 376 gay and bisexual men. OUTCOMES: Participants were asked to assess their sexual desire (ie, sexual drive and sexual motivation), COVID-19-related barriers (ie, perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection), and sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: It was found that while sexual desire remained prevalent among the gay and bisexual men, COVID-19-related barriers were also commonly observed. Sexual drive and sexual motivation were positively associated with sexual activity. Perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were negatively predictive of engaging in sexual activity, after controlling for general sexual desire. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding the ambivalence and driving and inhibiting factors for having sex during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a new framework for understanding people's sexual activity during an unprecedented scale of the pandemic. It is likely that abstinence would not work as the respondents expressed strong sexual desire and that the pandemic is going to last for a long time. Governments, policy makers, and sexual scientists need to work together to come up with practicable, feasible, and easy-to-follow guidelines for having sex during the pandemic. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the impact of COVID-19 on sexual activity among gay and bisexual men. The results should be interpreted with caution because of the use of cross-sectional design and nonprobability sampling.

While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.","output":"Short-hairpin RNAs delivered by lentiviral vector transduction trigger RIG-I-mediated IFN activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Standard precautions are a basic strategy to prevent occupational exposure in prehospital emergency staff.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. METHODS: We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. Then, we simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and NPIs on the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. RESULTS: We conduct case studies in four malaria-endemic countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia, in Africa. The epidemiological parameters (i.e., the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the duration of infection [Formula: see text]) of COVID-19 in each country are estimated as follows: Ethiopia ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), Nigeria ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), Tanzania ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), and Zambia ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, the epidemic curves simulated under various NPIs indicated that the earlier the interventions are implemented, the better the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, the effect of combined NPIs is better than contact restriction and social distancing only. By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.","output":"Accessing the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel mechanistic insights are discussed herein that link a single, nontoxic, low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) treatment (0.5-1.0 Gy) to (1) beneficial subcellular effects mediated by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related transcription factor (Nrf2) and to (2) favorable clinical outcomes for COVID-19 pneumonia patients displaying symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We posit that the favorable clinical outcomes following LDRT result from potent Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses that rebalance the oxidatively skewed redox states of immunological cells, driving them toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Activation of Nrf2 by ionizing radiation is highly dose dependent and conforms to the features of a biphasic (hormetic) dose-response. At the cellular and subcellular levels, hormetic doses of <1.0 Gy induce polarization shifts in the predominant population of lung macrophages, from an M1 pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Together, the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and the subsequent shifts to anti-inflammatory phenotypes have the capacity to suppress cytokine storms, resolve inflammation, promote tissue repair, and prevent COVID-19-related mortality. Given these mechanistic considerations-and the historical clinical success of LDRT early in the 20th century-we opine that LDRT should be regarded as safe and effective for use at almost any stage of COVID-19 infection. In theory, however, optimal life-saving potential is thought to occur when LDRT is applied prior to the cytokine storms and before the patients are placed on mechanical oxygen ventilators. The administration of LDRT either as an intervention of last resort or too early in the disease progression may be far less effective in saving the lives of ARDS patients.","output":"Nrf2 activation putatively mediates clinical benefits of low-dose radiotherapy in COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Novel mechanistic considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has raised major issues with regard to modelling and forecasting outcomes such as cases, deaths and hospitalisations. In particular, the forecasting of area-specific counts of infectious disease poses problems when counts are changing rapidly and there are infection hotspots, as in epidemic situations.

In this paper, we consider different specifications of autoregressive dependence in incidence counts as these may considerably impact on adaptivity in epidemic situations. In particular, we introduce parameters to allow temporal adaptivity in autoregressive dependence. A case study considers COVID-19 data for 144 English local authorities during the UK epidemic second wave in late 2020 and early 2021, which demonstrate geographical clustering in new caseslinked to the then emergent alpha variant. The model allows for both spatial and time variation in autoregressive effects.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31  109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29  109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48  109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39  109/L.

However, the role of this parameter in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains to be established. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of RVPAC to the occurrence of severe heart failure (HF) symptoms in patients with DCM using three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography. METHODS We prospectively screened 139 outpatients with DCM, 105 of whom were enrolled and underwent 3D echocardiographic assessment. RVPAC was estimated non-invasively as the 3D right ventricular stroke volume (SV) to end-systolic volume (ESV) ratio. Severe HF symptoms were defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. We evaluated differences in RVPAC across NYHA classes and the ability of RVPAC to predict severe symptoms. RESULTS Mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 287%. Mean RVPAC was 0.770.30 and it was significantly more impaired with increasing symptom severity (p = 0.001). RVPAC was the only independent determinant of severe HF symptoms, after adjusting for age, diuretic use, LV systolic function, LV diastolic function, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (OR 0.035 [95% CI, 0.004-0.312], p = 0.003). By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the RVPAC cut-off value for predicting severely symptomatic status was 0.54 (area under the curve = 0.712, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION 3D echocardiographic SV/ESV ratio is an independent correlate of severe HF symptoms in patients with DCM. 3D RVPAC might prove to be a useful risk stratification tool for these patients, should it be further validated in larger studies.","output":"Three-dimensional right ventriculo-arterial coupling as an independent determinant of severe heart failure symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory disease is a main feature of severe COVID-19, and the potential of IL-6 receptor blockade to increase risk of pneumonia warrants vigilance and caution in their application to treat COVID-19.","output":"Genetically proxied interleukin-6 receptor inhibition: opposing associations with COVID-19 and pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spraying roads with water on a large scale in Chinese cities is one of the supplementary precaution or mitigation actions implemented to control severe air pollution events or heavy haze-fog events in which the mechanisms causing them are not yet fully understood.

In the present study, the impact of water spraying on the PM(2.5) concentration and humidity in air was assessed by measuring chemical composition of the water, undertaking a simulated water spraying experiment, measuring residues and analyzing relevant data. We discovered that spraying large quantities of tap or river water on the roads leads to increased PM(2.5) concentration and humidity, and that daily continuous spraying produces a cumulative effect on air pollution. Spraying the same amount of water produces greater increases in humidity and PM(2.5) concentration during cool autumn and winter than during hot summer. Our results demonstrate that spraying roads with water increases, rather than decreases, the concentration of PM(2.5) and thus is a new source of anthropogenic aerosol and air pollution.

Methods: In this retrospective study, all cases were selected from Northwestern China, which has the lowest population density. As our study endpoints, the incubation period was defined as the date of departure from Wuhan City to the date of symptom onset; we defined the confirmed time as the interval from symptom onset to positive results (samples from the respiratory tract). Both of them were estimated by fitting a Weibull distribution on the departure date and symptom onset. The differences among the variables were analyzed. Results: A total of 139 patients were ultimately enrolled, and ~10.1% of patients (14 patients) had no symptoms during their disease course. We estimated the median incubation period to be 4.0 days (interquartile intervals, 2.0C8.0), and the 95th percentile of the distribution was 15.0 days. Moreover, ~5.6% of patients (7 patients) experienced symptoms 2 weeks after leaving. Furthermore, the estimation median interval from symptom onset to final diagnosis was 4.0 days (interquartile intervals, 2.0C6.0), and the 95th percentile of the distribution was 12.0 days. Finally, the median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 3.0 to 45.0 days. Univariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.021) and severity status (P = 0.001) were correlated significantly with hospitalization time.

Reptiles also possess greater longevity and may live much longer than similar-sized land mammals, for example, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles and tuatara are long-lived reptiles living up to 100 years or more. Many recent studies have emphasized the pivotal role of the gut microbiome on its host, thus we postulated that reptilian gut microbiome and/or its metabolites and the interplay with their robust immune system may contribute to their longevity and overall hardiness. Herein we discuss the composition of the reptilian gut microbiome, immune system-gut microbiome cross-talk, antimicrobial peptides, reptilian resistance to infectious diseases and cancer, ageing, as well the current knowledge of the genome and epigenome of these remarkable species. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that microbial gut flora of reptiles such as crocodiles, tortoises, water monitor lizard and python exhibit remarkable anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties, as well as comprise novel gut bacterial metabolites and antimicrobial peptides. The underlying mechanisms between the gut microbiome and the immune system may hold clues to developing new therapies overall for health, and possible extrapolation to exploit the ancient defense systems of reptiles for Homo sapiens benefit.","output":"Gut microbiome-immune system interaction in reptiles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to identify key factors affecting Healthcare workers (HCWs) perceived stress and risk of contracting COVID-19 among themselves and their family members during the pandemic Methods: A cross-sectional online questionnaire study was conducted between 19 March and April 5, 2020 in Hong Kong HCWs from public hospitals and private dentists, and their family members participated Results: A total of 747 HCWs and 245 family members participated Higher perceived stress in HCWs was associated with more negative changes in family relationship (p = 0 025) The HCWs' perceived stress, however, was positively associated with family cohesion (p = 0 033) and stress levels of family members (p &lt; 0 001) The level of HCWs' satisfaction toward the hospital policies in response to the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with lower levels of perceived stress and risk of themselves or their family members contracting COVID-19 HCWs' previous frontline experience of SARS was significantly associated with less perceived risk of themselves or their family members contracting COVID-19 Conclusion: Hospital policies addressing HCWs' needs, frontline experience of SARS, and family relationship influenced psychological wellbeing of HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak","output":"Multilevel Factors Affecting Healthcare Workers' Perceived Stress and Risk of Infection During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV) are divided into North American and European types, which show about 40% difference in their amino acid sequences. The divergence time of these two types has been estimated to be about 1980 from epidemiological data. This suggested that PRRSV have evolved at a higher evolutionary rate (order of 10(?2)/site/year) compared with other RNA viruses of 10(?3) to 10(?5)/site/year. Here, to test the evolutionary history of PRRSV speculated by the epidemiological background, we estimated the divergence time and evolutionary rate of PRRSV with molecular evolutionary analysis. Estimated divergence time (1972C1988) corresponded well to that estimated by the epidemiological data, and the evolutionary rate (4.71C9.8)  10(?2) of PRRSV was indeed the highest among RNA viruses so far reported. Furthermore, we inferred important sites for the adaptation in order to examine how PRRSV have adapted to swine since they emerged. The adaptive sites were located not only in the epitopes related to immunity but also in the transmembrane regions including a signal peptide. In particular, the adaptive sites in the transmembrane regions were considered to affect compatibility to the host cell membrane. We conclude that PRRSV were transmitted from another host species to swine in about 1980 and have adapted to swine by altering the transmembrane regions.","output":"The Origin and Evolution of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple-organ pathogenic proinflammatory responses. Direct viral tissue damage is a transient phenomenon that is generally not sustained throughout disease progression.","output":"Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020, the US government sent economic impact payments (EIPs) directly to households, as part of its measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rise in Bitcoin trading is highest among individuals without families and at exchanges catering to nonprofessional investors. We estimate that the EIP program has a significant but modest effect on the US dollarCBitcoin trading pair, increasing trade volume by about 3.8 percent. Trades associated with the EIPs result in a slight rise in the price of Bitcoin of 7 basis points. Nonetheless, the increase in trading is small compared to the size of the stimulus check program, representing only 0.02 percent of all EIP dollars.

This study aimed to investigate of the enhancement effect of acetic acid and chitosan on erythrosine-mediated PDI of Acinetobacter baumannii in planktonic and biofilm forms. The planktonic cell growth of three A. baumannii strains was subjected to PDI by using erythrosine B (50 M) in 0.01% acetic acid and green laser light (530 nm) at fluence of 40 J/cm(2). The phototoxic effect of erythrosine B (100 M) in combination with chitosan (12.5 mg/ml) (in a solution of acetic acid) at fluence of 80 J/cm2 on biofilms was also evaluated. Finally, the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of the mentioned mixture were assessed on human fibroblasts. Planktonic cells of all three studied A. baumannii strains were almost eradicated by erythrosine B-mediated PDI in the presence of acetic acid. Also, PDI combined with chitosan resulted in a marked decrease in the number of viable biofilm cells (> 3 log(10) CFU). At the same experimental conditions, only 15% of the fibroblasts were photoinactivated. The results showed that PDI by using erythrosine B in acetic acid is very effective against A. baumannii planktonic cells and could eliminate them significantly. Also, chitosan enhanced the anti-biofilm efficacy of erythrosine B-mediated PDI against A. baumannii, suggesting that combination therapy may be useful in targeting biofilms.","output":"Eradication of Acinetobacter baumannii Planktonic and Biofilm Cells Through Erythrosine-Mediated Photodynamic Inactivation Augmented by Acetic Acid and Chitosan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019, multidisciplinary research teams have wrestled with how best to control the pandemic in light of its considerable physical, psychological and economic damage.

We define a recommendation map as an online repository of recommendations from several guidelines on a condition, providing links to the underlying evidence and expert judgments that inform them, allowing users to filter and cross-tabulate the search results. We engaged guideline developers, users, and health software engineers in an iterative process to elaborate the WHO eTB recommendation map. RESULTS: Applying the seven-step framework, we included 228 recommendations, linked to 103 guideline questions and organized the recommendation map according to key components of the health question, including the original recommendations and rationale (https://who.tuberculosis.recmap.org/). CONCLUSION: The recommendation mapping framework provides the entire continuum of evidence mapping by framing recommendations within a guideline questions population, interventions, and comparators domains.

The current COVID-19 pandemic motivated us to computationally screen and evaluate our library of previously-synthesized 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles against the major SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Interestingly, few ligands showed promising low binding free energies (potent inhibitory interactions/affinities) with the active sites of some coronaviral-2 enzymes, specially the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp).

These binding energies are even considerably lower than those of remdesivir potent active metabolite GS-443902 (which showed -9.20 and -7.90 kcal/mol with the same targets, respectively). Further computational molecular investigation revealed that Taroxaz-104 molecule strongly inhibits one of the potential active sites of nCoV-RdRp (the one with which GS-443902 molecule mainly interacts), since it interacts with at least seven major active amino acid residues of its predicted pocket. The successful repurposing of Taroxaz-104 has been achieved after the promising results of the anti-COVID-19 biological assay were obtained, as the data showed that Taroxaz-104 exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.42 M) with interesting effectiveness against the new strains/variants of SARS-CoV-2.

The predictive ability of combinations of the hematological and biochemical parameters was significantly superior to that of a single parameter. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to neutrophil ratio index (ANRI) and the AST to monocyte ratio index (AMRI) were 0.791 and 0.812, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, an ANRI >= 6.03(OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.02-10.40, P=0.046) and an AMRI >= 36.32(OR: 3.64. 95% CI: 1.24-10.68, P=0.02) at admission were independent risk factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19. Conclusions: We found two novel predictors with promising predictive capacities for COVID-19 among all suspected patients: ANRI and AMRI.

With mounting reports of delirium, systemic inflammation, and evidence of neurotropism, a statement on cognitive impairment among COVID-19 cases is needed. A substantial literature has demonstrated that inflammation can severely disrupt brain function, suggesting an immune response, a cytokine storm, as a possible cause of neurocognitive impairments. In this light, the aim of the present study was to summarize the available knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 on cognition (i.e., herein, we broadly define cognition reflecting the reporting on this topic in the literature) during the acute and recovery phases of the disease, in hospitalized patients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 status. A systematic review of the literature identified six studies which document the prevalence of cognitive impairment, and one which quantifies deficits after recovery. Pooling the samples of the included studies (total sample n = 644) at three standards of quality produced conservative estimates of cognitive impairment ranging from 43.0 to 66.8% prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients only, as no studies which report on outpatients met criteria for inclusion in the main synthesis. The most common impairment reported was delirium and frequent reports of elevated inflammatory markers suggest etiology. Other studies have demonstrated that the disease involves marked increases in IL-6, TNF, and IL-1; cytokines known to have a profound impact on working memory and attention. Impairment of these cognitive functions is a characteristic aspect of delirium, which suggests these cytokines as key mediators in the etiology of COVID-19 induced cognitive impairments. Researchers are encouraged to assay inflammatory markers to determine the potential role of inflammation in mediating the disturbance of cognitive function in individuals affected by COVID-19.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the world has been intensely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in Wuhan, China. In the case of a novel virus identification, the early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence is essential for strategic planning, containment, and treatments. Deep learning techniques have been successfully used in many viral classification problems associated with viral infections diagnosis, metagenomics, phylogenetic, and analysis. This work proposes to generate an efficient viral genome classifier for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the deep neural network (DNN) based on stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) technique. We performed four different experiments to provide different levels of taxonomic classification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The confusion matrix presented the validation and test sets and the ROC curve for the validation set. In all experiments, the SSAE technique provided great performance results. In this work, we explored the utilization of image representations of the complete genome sequences as the SSAE input to provide a viral classification of the SARS-CoV-2. For that, a dataset based on k-mers image representation, with k = 6, was applied.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS Compare rates of food sufficiency and utilization of free food sources between working-age persons with and without disabilities in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In September 2020, an online survey was conducted with n = 13,270 working-age individuals with and without disabilities to gather information about food sufficiency prior to COVID-19 (i.e., in March 2020) and within the last seven days as well as receipt of free groceries or meals, use of food programs or pantries, and concerns with using free food sources over the past week. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to compare these measures for persons with and without disabilities. RESULTS Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, the proportion of working-age persons who were food sufficient decreased from March 2020 to September 2020 for persons with disabilities (59%-53%, a six-percentage point decrease) and for persons without disabilities (77%-73%, a four-percentage point decrease). The rates of change were not significantly different between groups. In September 2020, higher proportions of persons with disabilities (57%) used free food resources in the past week than persons without disabilities (41%).

This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system. METHODS: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%?6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4C2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0C2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6C2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%?30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR test-positive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0C1.6). CONCLUSIONS: Community risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.","output":"Quantification of occupational and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large U.S. healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Licorice is an herbal plant named for its unique sweet flavor.

Cancer patients usually cannot get every vaccine because their immunity is low. For this reason, we aimed to detect their anxiety and curiosity for new vaccines for a new disease. Methods The goal of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to investigate cancer patients perceptions of COVID vaccination. Over 18 years of age who have not yet been vaccinated for COVID-19 and who agreed to participate were included in the study. We applied three questionnaires between May and June 2021, one of them was prepared by us;the other two questionnaires were The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form and Anxiety Sensitivity index to a total of 497 participants. Chi-square, Spearmen correlation test, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression tests were used when comparing. Results Our participants ages were between 21 and 88, with a mean age of 61.38 (SD = 11.68), 48.6% (n = 251) of the participants were female. We discovered that 79.1% (n = 408) of respondents were not afraid of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. 27.7% (n = 143) of these patients were concerned about the COVID-19 vaccines adverse effects, and 24.2% (n = 125) were afraid of its side effects with their treatments. 91.1% (n = 470) of the patients did not know which vaccine they would have and the type of the vaccine. Since the anxiety level is generally higher in women, anxiety scores were also higher in cancers seen in women, such as breast and ovarian cancer. Of course, in parallel with this, anxiety scores were lower in prostate cancers. Special patient groups should not be neglected during this vaccine season, and their concerns should be addressed.

While the current literature about the COVID-19 pandemic extensively addresses clinical and laboratory-based studies, a gap remains still present in terms of evaluating the general public knowledge and behaviors towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this review was to form a preliminary and contemporary understanding of the general public knowledge, attitude, and behaviors towards the COVID-19 pandemic globally. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in various databases until May 2020. Each studys characteristics including the sample size, region, and study type were examined individually. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model and pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval (CI) of all evaluated outcomes such as adequate knowledge, positive feelings, worrisome about the COVID-19 pandemic, and practice were recorded and reported from each study. Parameters such as random distribution, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases were utilized to assess the quality of each retrieved record. Both Beggs and Eggers tests were employed to evaluate symmetry of funnel plots for assessment of publication bias. The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADEpro software. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies with 67,143 participants were analyzed. The overall prevalence of knowledge, positive attitude, worrisome, and practice of precautionary measures were 0.87 (95%CI, 0.84C0.89), 0.85 (95%CI, 0.77C0.92), 0.71 (95%CI, 0.61C0.81), and 0.77 (95%CI, 0.70C0.83), respectively.

RESULTS We did not observe an enhanced humoral immune response in patients under active or past ICI therapy after COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, there is a tendency of higher antibody levels when ICI therapy was received within the last six months before vaccination. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients in our study population under ongoing targeted therapy during vaccination period had significantly higher median antibody levels than patients without any active antitumor treatment.

METHODS: We used results from the Korean National Burden of Disease and Injuries Study 2015 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by gender and age groups from 2007 to 2015. DALYs were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs). RESULTS: In 2015, the burden of disease for Korean people was calculated at 29,476 DALYs per 100,000 population. DALYs caused by low back pain were the highest, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The burden of disease showed a consistently increasing trend from 2007 to 2015. Although YLLs have been on the decrease since 2011, the increase in YLDs has contributed to the overall rise in DALYs.

This article describes five principles to guide and assist statistical agencies, mobile network operators and intermediary service providers, who are actively working on projects using mobile operator data to support governments in monitoring the effectiveness of its COVID-19 related interventions. These are principles of necessity and proportionality, of professional independence, of privacy protection, of commitment to quality, and of international comparability. Compliance with each of these principles can help maintain public trust in the handling of these sensitive data and their results, and therefore keep citizen support for government policies. Three projects (in Estonia, Ghana, and the Gambia) were described and reviewed with respect to the compliance and applicability of the five principles. Most attention was placed on privacy protection, somewhat at the expense of the quality of the compiled indicators. The necessity and proportionality in the choice of mobile operator data can be very well justified given the need for timely, frequent and granular indicators.

Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the payer level, respectively. METHODS We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (50,000/QALY gained) were obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses. RESULTS As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the \\"no-MEA\\" case (ICER ~ 78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSION Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer.

Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA viruses, coronaviruses, impose great threat to public safety and animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infection is largely unknown. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provided evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We further demonstrated that the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 was responsible for the interference of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A strongly triggered transcription of IFN- which in turn greatly affected rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication. Further analysis showed that SGs function as an antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. Additional evidence includes the aggregation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling intermediates to the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease nsp15 of IBV interferes with the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually ensuring productive virus replication. We further demonstrated that nsp15s from PEDV, TGEV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 harbor the conserved function to interfere with the formation of chemically-induced SGs. Thus, we speculate that coronaviruses employ similar nsp15-mediated mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation to ensure efficient virus replication.","output":"Inhibition of anti-viral stress granule formation by coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 ensures efficient virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An \\"infection,\\" understood here in a very broad sense, can be propagated through the network of social contacts among individuals. These social contacts include both \\"close\\" contacts and \\"casual\\" encounters among individuals in transport, leisure, shopping, etc. Knowing the first through the study of the social networks is not a difficult task, but having a clear picture of the network of casual contacts is a very hard problem in a society of increasing mobility. Here we assume, on the basis of several pieces of empirical evidence, that the casual contacts between two individuals are a function of their social distance in the network of close contacts. Then, we assume that we know the network of close contacts and infer the casual encounters by means of nonrandom long-range (LR) interactions determined by the social proximity of the two individuals. This approach is then implemented in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model accounting for the spread of infections in complex networks. A parameter called \\"conductance\\" controls the feasibility of those casual encounters. In a zero conductance network only contagion through close contacts is allowed. As the conductance increases the probability of having casual encounters also increases. We show here that as the conductance parameter increases, the rate of propagation increases dramatically and the infection is less likely to die out. This increment is particularly marked in networks with scale-free degree distributions, where infections easily become epidemics.

In this article we present an overview of the immediate programmatic and epidemiologic impact of the pandemic on polio eradication as well as the adaptive strategic and operational measures taken by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) from March through September 2020. Shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, the GPEI initially redirected the programmes assets to tackle COVID-19 and suspended house-to-house supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) while also striving to continue essential poliovirus surveillance functions. From March to May 2020, 28 countries suspended a total of 62 polio vaccine SIAs. In spite of efforts to continue poliovirus surveillance, global acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases reported from January-July 2020 declined by 34% compared with the same period in 2019 along with decreases in the mean number of environment samples collected per active site in the critical areas of the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. The GPEI recommended countries should resume planning and implementation of SIAs starting in July 2020 and released guidelines to ensure these could be done safely for front line workers and communities. By the end of September 2020, a total of 14 countries had implemented circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak response vaccination campaigns and Afghanistan and Pakistan restarted SIAs to stop ongoing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) transmission. The longer-term impacts of disruptions to eradication efforts remain to be determined, especially in terms of the effect on poliovirus epidemiology. Adapting to the pandemic situation has imposed new considerations on program implementation and demonstrated not only GPEIs contribution to global health security, but also identified potential opportunities for coordinated approaches across immunization and health services.","output":"The immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on polio immunization and surveillance activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to address the association between cerebrovascular disease and adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients by using a quantitative meta-analysis based on adjusted effect estimates.

National Geomatics Center of China (NGCC) and China Meteorological Administration provided data about altitude, latitude, longitude, average annual temperature, and average annual sunshine duration. Non-cycloplegic refraction was recorded, and prevalence rates in primary school students and factors associated with myopia were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the independent association of risk factors of myopia. RESULTS: The overall myopia prevalence was 28.0%, from 7.5% to 50.6% for first and sixth grades, respectively. Low, moderate and high myopia significantly increased with school grades from 7.30% to 35.0%, 0.3% to 13.60% and 0.00% to 1.9%, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that longer average cumulative daylight hours were connected to lower myopia prevalence in primary school students (OR, 0.721; 95% CI, [0.593C0.877]; P=0.001), whereas girls and higher grade was independently associated with higher myopia prevalence (girls: =0.189; OR, 1.208; 95% CI, [1.052C1.387]; P=0.007; higher grade: =0.502; OR, 1.652; 95% CI, [1.580C1.726]; P<0.001).

Methodological approaches to investigate the health impacts of air pollution on epidemics should differ from those used for chronic diseases, but the methods used in these studies have not been appraised critically. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify and critique the methodological approaches of studies of air pollution on infections and mortality due to COVID-19 and to identify and critique the methodological approaches of similar studies concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Published and unpublished papers of associations between air pollution and developing or dying from COVID-19 or SARS that were reported as of 10 May 2020 were identified through electronic databases, internet searches, and other sources. RESULTS: All six COVID-19 studies and two of three SARS studies reported positive associations. Two were time series studies that estimated associations between daily changes in air pollution, one was a cohort that assessed associations between air pollution and the secondary spread of SARS, and six were ecological studies that used area-wide exposures and outcomes. Common shortcomings included possible cross-level bias in ecological studies, underreporting of health outcomes, using grouped data, the lack of highly spatially resolved air pollution measures, inadequate control for confounding and evaluation of effect modification, not accounting for regional variations in the timing of outbreaks' temporal changes in at-risk populations, and not accounting for nonindependence of outcomes.

A DL model aims to detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency","output":"Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Detection -- A state-of-the-art review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examined the relationship between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positivity and clinical outcomes of vitamin D levels measured within the 6 months before the PCR test in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19)\\\\positive patients.

Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019CNovember 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID\\\\19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements.

To estimate the magnitude of potential patient cost sharing if waivers are not implemented or are allowed to expire, this study assesses the level and predictors of out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations in 2018 among elderly Medicare Advantage patients. METHODS: Using the Optum De-Identified Clinformatics DataMart, investigators identified Medicare Advantage patients aged &#8805;65 years hospitalized for influenza in 2018. For each hospitalization, out-of-pocket spending was calculated by summing deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. The mean out-of-pocket spending and the proportion of hospitalizations with out-of-pocket spending exceeding $2,500 were calculated. A 1-part generalized linear model with a log link and Poisson variance function was fitted to model out-of-pocket spending as a function of patient demographic characteristics, plan type, and hospitalization characteristics. Coefficients were converted to absolute changes in out-of-pocket spending by calculating average marginal effects. RESULTS: Among 14,278 influenza hospitalizations, the mean out-of-pocket spending was $987 (SD=$799). Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2,500 for 3.0% of hospitalizations. The factors associated with higher out-of-pocket spending included intensive care use, greater length of stay, and enrollment in a preferred provider organization plan (average marginal effect=$634, 95% CI=$631, $636) compared with enrollment in an HMO plan. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of elderly Medicare Advantage patients, the mean out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations was almost $1,000. Federal policymakers should consider passing legislation mandating insurers to eliminate cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Insurers with existing cost-sharing waivers should consider extending them indefinitely, and those without such waivers should consider implementing them immediately.","output":"Out-of-Pocket Spending for Influenza Hospitalizations in Medicare Advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artculo investiga las percepciones de los profesores de ingls en formacin sobre su prctica de ense?anza en lnea durante tiempos de pandemia, centrndose en cuestiones relacionadas con la tecnologa, el desarrollo de materiales y la gamificacin.

Then we analyzed the structure-activity relationship of Vitamin K3 analogues and identified 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone with 9.8 times higher inhibitory activity than Vitamin K3. Further mass spectrometric analysis and molecular docking study verified the covalent binding between Vitamin K3 or 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

We hypothesize that using deep transfer learning on normal-appearing findings on head computed tomography (HCT) scans performed after ROSC would allow us to identify early evidence of HIBI. METHODS: We analyzed 54 adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest for whom both an initial HCT scan, done early after ROSC, and a follow-up HCT scan were available. The initial HCT scan of each included patient was read as normal by a board-certified neuroradiologist. Deep transfer learning was used to evaluate the initial HCT scan and predict progression of HIBI on the follow-up HCT scan. A naive set of 16 additional patients were used for external validation of the model. RESULTS: The median age (interquartile range) of our cohort was 61 (16) years, and 25 (46%) patients were female. Although findings of all initial HCT scans appeared normal, follow-up HCT scans showed signs of HIBI in 29 (54%) patients (computed tomography progression). Evaluating the first HCT scan with deep transfer learning accurately predicted progression to HIBI. The deep learning score was the most significant predictor of progression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.96 [95% confidence interval 0.91C1.00]), with a deep learning score of 0.494 having a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.88, accuracy of 0.94, and positive predictive value of 0.91. An additional assessment of an independent test set confirmed high performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.90 [95% confidence interval 0.74C1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: Deep transfer learning used to evaluate normal-appearing findings on HCT scans obtained early after ROSC in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest accurately identifies patients who progress to show radiographic evidence of HIBI on follow-up HCT scans.","output":"Machine Learning for Early Detection of Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury After Cardiac Arrest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of Uber and analogous platform companies has led to considerable scholarly interest in the phenomenon of platform labor. Scholars have taken two main approaches to explaining outcomes for platform workprecarity, which focuses on employment classification and insecure labor, and technological control via algorithms. Both predict that workers will have relatively common experiences. On the basis of 112 in-depth interviews with workers on seven platforms (Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Turo, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, and Favor) we find heterogeneity of experiences across and within platforms. We argue that because platform labor is weakly institutionalized, worker satisfaction, autonomy, and earnings vary significantly across and within platforms, suggesting dominant interpretations are insufficient. We find that the extent to which workers are dependent on platform income to pay basic expenses rather than working for supplemental income explains the variation in outcomes, with supplemental earners being more satisfied and higher-earning. This suggests platforms are free-riding on conventional employers. We also find that platforms are hierarchically ordered, in terms of what providers can earn, conditions of work, and their ability to produce satisfied workers. Our findings suggest the need for a new analytic approach to platforms, which emphasizes labor force diversity, connections to conventional labor markets, and worker dependence.","output":"Dependence and precarity in the platform economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly all over the world, has become the most important cause of the emotional distress for susceptible people.

While proteomics has been used to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, there are limited data about the status of proteome profile in different human body sites infected by sarscov2 virus. To bridge this gap, our study aims to profile the proteins secreted in urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), gargle solution, and nasopharyngeal samples and assess the proteome differences in these body samples collected from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Materials and methods: We downloaded publicly available proteomic data from (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/). The data we downloaded had the following identifiers: i) PXD019423, n=3 from Charles Tanford Protein Center in Germany. ii) PXD018970, n=15 from Beijing Proteome Research Centre, China. iii)PXD022085, n=5 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, and iv) PXD022889, n=18 from Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 USA. MaxQuant was used for the peptide spectral matching using human and SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from UniProt database (access date 13th October 2021). Results: The individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 viruses displayed a different proteome diversity from the different body sites we investigated. Overally, we identified 1809 proteins across the four different sample types we compared. Urine and BALF samples had significantly more abundant SARS-CoV-2 proteins than the other body sites we compared. Urine samples had 257(33.7%) unique proteins followed by nasopharyngeal with 250(32.8%) unique proteins. Garlge solution and BALF had 38(5%) and 73(9.6%) unique proteins respectively.

Respiratory virus-laden particles are commonly detected in the exhaled breath of symptomatic patients or in air sampled from healthcare settings. However, the temporal relationship of detecting virus-laden particles at nonhealthcare locations vs surveillance data obtained by conventional means has not been fully assessed. Methods. From October 2016 to June 2018, air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong. Viral genomes were detected and quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of ecological and environmental factors associated with the detection of virus-laden airborne particles. Results. Influenza A (16.9% [117/694]) and influenza B (4.5% [31/694]) viruses were detected at higher frequencies in air than rhinovirus (2.2% [6/270]), respiratory syncytial virus (0.4% [1/270]), or human coronaviruses (0% [0/270]). Multivariate analyses showed that increased crowdedness (aOR, 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5-3.8]; P &lt; .001) and higher indoor temperature (aOR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3]; P &lt; .001) were associated with detection of influenza airborne particles, but absolute humidity was not (aOR, 0.9 [95% CI, .7-1.1]; P = .213).

Methods After successful record linkage genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were carried out on expenditure for total health, mental health, primary and hospital care and medication. Record linkage for genotype data from 16,726 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) with data from Statistics Netherlands was accomplished in the secure OSSC platform, followed by gene-based tests and estimation of total and SNP-based heritability. Results The total heritability of expenditure ranged between 29.4 (SE 0.8) and 37.5 (SE 0.8) per cent, but GWA analyses did not identify single SNPs or genes that were genome-wide significantly associated with health care expenditure. SNP-based heritability was between 0.0 (SE 3.5) and 5.4 (SE 4.0) per cent and was different from zero for mental health care and primary care expenditure. Conclusions We successfully linked genotype data to administrative health care expenditure data from Statistics Netherlands and performed a series of analyses on health care expenditure.

We identify some of the initial impacts of the great lockdown on sustainable and fossil sources of energy, and consider how economic stimulus packages and social practices in the wake of the pandemic are likely to shape energy demand, the carbon-intensity of the energy system, and the speed of transitions. Adopting a broad multi-scalar and multi-actor approach to the analysis of energy system change, we highlight continuities and discontinuities with pre-pandemic trends. Discussion focuses on four key themes that shape the politics of sustainable energy transitions: (i) the short, medium and long-term temporalities of energy system change; (ii) practices of investment around clean-tech and divestment from fossil fuels; (iii) structures and scales of energy governance; and (iv) social practices around mobility, work and public health.

Most flaviviruses are classified as zoonotic viruses. Human flavivirus infections can be asymptomatic, responsible for unspecific symptoms in the first few days following infection, or responsible for severe complications potentially resulting in death. During the first days following symptom onset, laboratory diagnosis of acute human flavivirus infection is mainly based on molecular detection of the viral genome by RT-PCR methods, followed by the capture of specific antibodies using serological tests after the first week of infection. The detection of antibodies that have virus neutralizing activity can be used to confirm flavivirus infection. However, human flavivirus infections induce the production of cross-reactive antibodies, often making serology inconclusive. Indeed, serological diagnosis of flavivirus infection can be hampered by a patients history of flavivirus exposure, particularly in regions where multiple antigenically related flaviviruses co-circulate. We focus our mini review on conventional immunoassays that allow the diagnosis of major flavivirus-associated human infections in basic, routine and high-profile central health centers; and the interpretation of diagnostic serology tests for patients living within different epidemiological situations.","output":"Serological Diagnosis of Flavivirus-Associated Human Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 transmission was significant amongst Qatars working population during the MarchCJuly 2020 outbreak. The study aimed to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across various workplace settings and demographics in the State of Qatar. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing surveillance data of all workplaces with 10 or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. These workplaces were categorized using a mapping table adapted from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, 2017 version. The data was then analyzed to estimate and compare the positivity rate as an indicator of the risk of developing COVID-19 infection across various workplace settings in the State of Qatar. RESULTS: The highest positivity rate was reported amongst the Construction & Related (40.0%) and the Retail & Wholesale Trade sectors (40.0%), whereas, the lowest positivity rate was attributed to the healthcare workplace setting (11.0%). The highest incidence of COVID-19 infections occurred in South Asian nationalities and in the male gender. The private funded sector employees have seen higher positivity rate than employees of the governmental funded sector. CONCLUSION: The elevated risk of infection in Construction and Retail & Wholesale Trade is probably due to environmental and educational vulnerabilities. The predominant labor force of those workplace categories is South Asian craft and male manual workers. Alternatively, the better containment of the healthcare workplace setting can be attributed to the enforcement of infection control and occupational safety measures. These findings imply the importance of using preventive and surveillance strategies for high-risk workplace settings appropriately.","output":"COVID-19 infection across workplace settings in Qatar: a comparison of COVID-19 positivity rates of screened workers from March 1st until July 31st, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continued waves, new variants, and limited vaccine deployment mean that SARS-CoV-2 tests remain vital to constrain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Affordable, point-of-care (PoC) tests allow rapid screening in non-medical settings. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an appealing approach. A crucial step is to optimize testing in low/medium resource settings. Here, we optimized RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 and human -actin, and tested clinical samples in multiple countries. TTTT linker primers did not improve performance, and while guanidine hydrochloride, betaine and/or Igepal-CA-630 enhanced detection of synthetic RNA, only the latter two improved direct assays on nasopharygeal samples. With extracted clinical RNA, a 20 min RT-LAMP assay was essentially as sensitive as RT-PCR. With raw Canadian nasopharygeal samples, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100%) for those with RT-qPCR Ct values  25, and 80% (95% CI: 58.4% - 91.9%) for those with 25 < Ct  27.2. Highly infectious, high titer cases were also detected in Colombian and Ecuadorian labs. We further demonstrate the utility of replacing thermocyclers with a portable PoC device (FluoroPLUM).

Interactions are everywhere. At the cellular level, protein interactions play a key role and their ensemble, also called interactome, is often referred as the basic building blocks of life. Given its importance, the maintenance of the integrity of the interactome is a real challenge in the cell. Many events during evolution can disrupt interactomes and potentially result in different characteristics for the organisms. However, the molecular underpinnings of changes in interactions at the cellular level are still largely unexplored. Among the perturbations, hybridization puts in contact two different interactomes, which may lead to many changes in the protein interaction network of the hybrid, including gains and losses of interactions. We recently investigated the fate of the interactomes after hybridization between yeast species using a comparative proteomics approach. A large-scale conservation of the interactions was observed in hybrids, but we also noticed the presence of proteostasis-related changes. This suggests that, despite a general robustness, small differences may accumulate in hybrids and perturb their protein physiology.

Self-collected swab techniques can overcome many of the disadvantages of a nasopharyngeal swab, but they require evaluation. METHODS: Three self-collected non-nasopharyngeal swab techniques (saline gargle, oral swab and combined oral-anterior nasal swab) were compared to a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 detection at multiple COVID-19 assessment centers in Toronto, Canada. The performance characteristics of each test were assessed. RESULTS: The adjusted sensitivity of the saline gargle was 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.94), the oral swab was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89) and the combined oral-anterior nasal swab was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.93) compared to a nasopharyngeal swab, which demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% when all positive tests were the reference standard. The median cycle threshold values for the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene for concordant and discordant saline gargle specimens were 17 and 31 (P < .001), for the oral swabs these values were 17 and 28 (P < .001), and for oral-anterior nasal swabs these values were 18 and 31 (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected saline gargle and an oral-anterior nasal swab have a similar sensitivity to a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. These alternative collection techniques are cheap and can eliminate barriers to testing, particularly in underserved populations.","output":"Detection of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in outpatients: A multicenter comparison of self-collected saline gargle, oral swab, and combined oral-anterior nasal swab to a provider collected nasopharyngeal swab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus has been spreading since December 2019.

The purpose of this study was to examine how Asian Americans racism and discrimination experiences were related to firearm-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 from a national sample of 916 Asian Americans. Measures included demographics, firearm-related risks, and three measures of racism/discrimination experiences since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among individuals who purchased a gun since the start of the pandemic, 54.6% were first-time gun owners. Among household gun owners, 42.8% stored loaded guns and 47.1% stored guns unlocked. More than 38% of individual gun owners have carried a gun more frequently since the pandemic. After controlling for family firearm ownership and demographics, regression analyses showed that Asian Americans who experienced racial discrimination were more likely to purchase a gun and ammunition and intend to purchase more ammunition during the COVID-19 pandemic. AAs who perceived more cultural racism were more likely to purchase a gun. Individuals who reported higher anticipatory racism-related stress reported greater intent to purchase guns.

METHODS: Patients receiving tuberculosis treatment through the chest clinic at a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, participated in a semi-structured interview. The interviews explored the treatment burden experienced by patients and possible solutions to ameliorate this burden. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. They were recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12 software. RESULTS: Twenty participants (80% male, mean age 40 years) with pulmonary (n = 13) and extra-pulmonary (n = 7) tuberculosis were interviewed. Participants experienced healthcare, financial, social and medication burdens along with lifestyle changes due to treatment. Medication intake was challenging due to the high number of pills, and 55% (n = 11) of patients experienced fatigue amongst other side effects. Patients found clinic-based directly observed therapy inconvenient, especially those working and/or studying. Suggestions to lessen treatment burden included reducing medication burden and better access to health services. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis treatment is associated with substantial treatment burden for patients.

However, the association between chronic diseases and these psychological conditions remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the relationship between anxiety, depression, and common chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and rheumatoid arthritis), and their association with social determinants at an outpatient primary care setting. METHODS: The validated hospital anxiety and depression scale was administered electronically to eligible participants. For each condition (anxiety and depression), participants were categorized as normal, borderline abnormal, and abnormal, according to their score out of 21 (7 = normal, 8-10 = borderline abnormal, 11 = abnormal). The scores and numbers of participants in each category were analyzed and compared with their demographic characteristics and chronic diseases for associations and relationships. RESULTS: We recruited 271 participants (mean age of 51.65 + 11.71 years) attending primary care clinics. Of these patients, 17.7% and 8.9% had borderline abnormal and abnormal depression, respectively, and 10.3% and 8.9% of patients had borderline abnormal anxiety and abnormal anxiety. Common social determinants and lifestyle factors were examined. Age, gender, and sugary drinks consumption significantly increased the odds of hypertension and type 2 diabetes; vigorous physical activity 3 times a week, decreased the odds of developing these chronic diseases. Adjusted regression models showed a statistically significant association between the hospital anxiety and depression scale score for borderline and abnormal anxiety and the presence of type 2 diabetes (OR 3.04 [95% CI 1.13, 8.19], P-value = .03 and OR 4.65 [95% CI 1.63,13.22], P-value <.03, respectively) and dyslipidemia (OR 5.93 [95% CI 1.54, 22.86], P-value = .01, and OR 4.70 [95% CI 0.78, 28.35], P-value = .09, respectively).

Understanding support needs and access to support among people bereaved at this time is crucial to ensuring appropriate bereavement support infrastructure. AIM: To investigate grief experiences, support needs and use of formal and informal bereavement support among people bereaved during the pandemic. DESIGN: Baseline results from a longitudinal survey. Support needs and experiences of accessing support are reported using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text data. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 711 adults bereaved in the UK between March and December 2020, recruited via media, social media, national associations and community/charitable organisations. RESULTS: High-level needs for emotional support were identified. Most participants had not sought support from bereavement services (59%, n = 422) or their General-Practitioner (60%, n = 428). Of participants who had sought such support, over half experienced difficulties accessing bereavement services (56%, n = 149)/General-Practitioner support (52%, n = 135). About 51% reported high/severe vulnerability in grief; among these, 74% were not accessing bereavement or mental-health services. Barriers included limited availability, lack of appropriate support, discomfort asking for help and not knowing how to access services. About 39% (n = 279) experienced difficulties getting support from family/friends, including relational challenges, little face-to-face contact and disrupted collective mourning. The perceived uniqueness of pandemic bereavement and wider societal strains exacerbated their isolation.

QUIN also regulates glutamate uptake into neurons, which may be due to modulation of Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). To determine the biological relationships between QUIN and glutamate dysfunction, we first quantified the functionality and kinetics of [3H]QUIN uptake in primary human neurons using liquid scintillation. We then measured changes in the protein expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT3 and EAAT1b in primary neurons treated with QUIN and the EAAT inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDC) using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was further used to elucidate intracellular transport of exogenous QUIN and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Structural insights into the binding between QUIN and EAAT3 were further investigated using molecular docking techniques. We report significant temperature-dependent high-affinity transport leading to neuronal uptake of [3H]QUIN with a Km of 42.2 M, and a Vmax of 9.492 pmol/2 min/mg protein, comparable with the uptake of glutamate. We also found that QUIN increases expression of the EAAT3 monomer while decreasing the functional trimer. QUIN uptake into primary neurons was shown to involve EAAT3 as uptake was significantly attenuated following EAAT inhibition. We also demonstrated that QUIN increases the expression of aberrant EAAT1b protein in neurons further implicating QUIN-induced glutamate dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that QUIN is metabolised exclusively in lysosomes. The involvement of EAAT3 as a modulator for QUIN uptake was further confirmed using molecular docking. This study is the first to characterise a mechanism for QUIN uptake into primary human neurons involving EAAT3, opening potential targets to attenuate QUIN-induced excitotoxicity in neuroinflammatory diseases.","output":"Potential Mechanism of Cellular Uptake of the Excitotoxin Quinolinic Acid in Primary Human Neurons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the greatest public health challenges and imposes a great threat to human health.

Use of Mobile health for vaccine safety surveillance enables a consumer-centred approach to reporting. The Stimulated Telephone Assisted Rapid Safety Surveillance (STARSS) a randomised control trial (RCT) sought to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of SMS for AEFI surveillance. METHODS: Multi-centre RCT, participants were adult vaccinees or parents of children receiving any vaccine at a trial site. At enrolment randomisation occurred to one of two SMS groups or a control group. Prompts on days 2, 7 and 14 post-immunisation, were sent to the SMS group, to ascertain if a medical event following immunisation (MEFI) had occurred. No SMS's were sent to the control participants. Those in the SMS who notified an MEFI were pre-randomised to complete a computer assisted telephone interview or a web based report to determine if an AEFI had occurred whilst an AEFI in the controls was determined by a search for passive reports. The primary outcome was the AEFI detection rate in the SMS group compared to controls. RESULTS: We enrolled 6,338 participants, who were equally distributed across groups and who received 11,675 vaccines. The SMS group (4,225) received 12,675 surveillance prompts with 9.8% being non-compliant and not responding. In those that responded 90% indicated that no MEFI had been experienced and 184 had a verified AEFI. 6 control subjects had a reported AEFI. The AEFI detection rate was 13 fold greater in the SMS group when compared with controls (4.3 vs 0.3%). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the STARSS methodology improves AEFI detection.

Case reports in adults are traditionally described in severely immunocompromised individuals after organ transplant or in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. In this case we describe severe adenovirus pneumonia in a patient treated with monthly rituximab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50 year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with monthly rituximab, presents with 8 days of worsening dyspnea. He endorsed mild cough and abdominal discomfort. Two days prior, his dyspnea became severe. He and his wife, who works at a daycare center, tested negative in an outpatient center for COVID19 virus. He denied changes in taste, smell, chest pain or any known COVID19 contacts. Initial chest X-ray revealed multifocal opacities suggestive of bronchopneumonia. He was started on empiric cefepime and azithromycin. Inflammatory markers ferritin, D-dimer, CRP and ESR were elevated at 1257, 869, 184 and 63 respectively. His initial swab for COVID19 virus was negative. On admission, he required supplemental oxygen at 15L via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation of 92-96%. Throughout his course, he was tested 6 times for COVID19 all of which resulted as negative. A respiratory viral panel sent on admission detected adenovirus. He was started on a treatment course of cidofovir with probenecid. Treatment initiation was delayed due to lag time of 9 days from the viral panel sent to the results becoming available. Unfortunately, after a prolonged hospital stay, he developed respiratory failure but elected to not be intubated. He became dependent on non-invasive ventilatory support and passed away on day 26 of admission. DISCUSSION: Rituximab is an off label therapy for MS. It acts as a chimeric monoclonal Bcell antiCD20 antibody, halting Bcell production, and reducing Tcell activation and antigen presentation 2. Patients taking rituximab are considered immunosuppressed and are at higher risk for infection;however, per our literature review, there have been no reported cases of adenovirus bronchopneumonia deaths associated with rituximab. Adenovirus is associated with classic \\"flu like\\" syndrome in children. In adults the virus is usually benign, presenting with mild gastrointestinal and less commonly mild upper respiratory symptoms 1. Patients undergoing rituximab treatment are at an increased risk of infection with hepatitis B, PML and PJP pneumonia 3,4. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for severe adenovirus pneumonia is cidofovir and probenecid. Small studies have shown it to be efficacious in pediatric populations 5,6. Due to the high prevalence of COVID19, availability bias remained high and the negative predictive value of PCR tests were low 7. Despite negative PCR tests, the presence of adenovirus was thought of as a red herring leading to a 9 day delay in treatment.

Alternative sources of surgical masks, including 3-dimensionally (3D) printed approaches that may be reused, are urgently needed to prevent PPE shortages. Few data exist identifying decontamination strategies to inactivate viral pathogens and retain 3D-printing material integrity. OBJECTIVE: To test viral disinfection methods on 3D-printing materials. METHODS: The viricidal activity of common disinfectants (10% bleach, quaternary ammonium sanitizer, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 70% isopropanol and exposure to heat (50C, and 70C) were tested on four 3D-printed materials used in the healthcare setting, including a surgical mask design developed by the Veterans Health Administration. Inactivation was assessed for several clinically relevant RNA and DNA pathogenic viruses, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and all viruses tested were completely inactivated by a single application of bleach, ammonium quaternary compounds, or hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, exposure to dry heat (70C) for 30 minutes completely inactivated all viruses tested. In contrast, 70% isopropanol reduced viral titers significantly less well following a single application. Inactivation did not interfere with material integrity of the 3D-printed materials. CONCLUSIONS: Several standard decontamination approaches effectively disinfected 3D-printed materials. These approaches were effective in the inactivation SARS-CoV-2, its surrogates, and other clinically relevant viral pathogens. The decontamination of 3D-printed surgical mask materials may be useful during crisis situations in which surgical mask supplies are limited.","output":"Inactivation of Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Diverse RNA and DNA Viruses on Three-Dimensionally Printed Surgical Mask Materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal models are often used to assess the airborne transmissibility of various pathogens, which are typically assumed to be carried by expiratory droplets emitted directly from the respiratory tract of the infected animal. We recently established that influenza virus is also transmissible via aerosolized fomites, micron-scale dust particulates released from virus-contaminated surfaces (Asadi et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):4062, 2020). Here we expand on this observation, by counting and characterizing the particles emitted from guinea pig cages using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and an Interferometric Mie Imaging (IMI) system. Of over 9000 airborne particles emitted from guinea pig cages and directly imaged with IMI, none had an interference pattern indicative of a liquid droplet. Separate measurements of the particle count using the APS indicate that particle concentrations spike upwards immediately following animal motion, then decay exponentially with a time constant commensurate with the air exchange rate in the cage. Taken together, the results presented here raise the possibility that a non-negligible fraction of airborne influenza transmission events between guinea pigs occurs via aerosolized fomites rather than respiratory droplets, though the relative frequencies of these two routes have yet to be definitively determined.","output":"Non-respiratory particles emitted by guinea pigs in airborne disease transmission experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Thigh muscle strength capacities are major modifiable risk factors for knee and thigh muscle injuries. Therefore, their valid assessment is essential. Most isokinetic knee tests are conducted in a seated position and rely on dynamometer-based data. However, their accuracy is doubtful because axis alignment is erroneous. Purpose: This study investigated if hip angle (flexed vs. extended) and assessment method (dynamometer-based vs. camera-based) affect isokinetic outcome parameters. Methods: Sixteen healthy male participants (27 years, 184 cm, 80 kg) performed discrete isokinetic tests of the knee flexors and extensors (60/s) while their kinematics were captured (100 fps). Results: Both assessment methods revealed very strong linear relationships (94%  R2  98%) although peak moments (d  0.87), contractional work (d  1.26), and functional knee flexor:extensor ratios (d  0.81) significantly differed. Seated knee flexor tests demonstrated the largest knee trajectory center's misalignment (x = 4.0 cm, z = -2.5 cm; 1.37  d  4.74). Conclusion: Hip-angle induced kinematic changes did not affect the relation between the lever arms, thus causing highly proportional deviations of kinetic parameters. The assessment method altered the magnitude, but not the message of isokinetic knee tests, which should be preferentially performed with extended hip joint to improve axis alignment. Knowledge of these kinetic and kinematic interactions assists practitioners and scientists with isokinetic tests and/or rehabilitation training to ensure reasonable interpretations of gathered isokinetic outcomes.","output":"Analyses of Isokinetic Thigh Muscle Strength: Camera-Based Assessment Alters the Magnitude, but Not the Message"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Depression is a disabling mental illness and therefore also a serious public health problem.

The sequestration of IL-18 by its soluble decoy receptor IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP) is critical to the regulation of IL-18 activity. Since an imbalance in expression and circulating levels of IL-18 is associated with disease, structural insights into how IL-18BP outcompetes binding of IL-18 by its cognate cell-surface receptors would be highly desirable. However, the structure of human IL-18BP in complex with IL-18 had remained elusive. Here, we elucidate the sequestration mechanism of human IL-18 mediated by IL-18BP based on the crystal structure of the IL-18:IL-18BP complex. These detailed structural snapshots reveal the interaction landscape leading to the ultra-high affinity of IL-18BP towards IL-18 and identify substantial differences with respect to previously characterized complexes of IL-18 with IL-18BP of viral origin. Furthermore, our structure captured a fortuitous higher-order assembly between IL-18 and IL-18BP coordinated by a disulfide-bond distal to the binding surface connecting IL-18 and IL-18BP molecule from different complexes, resulting in a novel complex with 2:2 stoichiometry. This tetrapartite assembly was found to restrain IL-18 activity more effectively than the canonical 1:1 complex. Collectively, our findings will provide a framework for innovative structure-driven therapeutic strategies and further functional interrogation of IL-18 in physiology and disease. Significance statement Elevated levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) have long been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases while also displaying potent anti-tumoral activities. Recent research on COVID-19 has now underscored the role of IL-18 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a soluble receptor serving to regulate IL-18 activity, as key players in viral immunity and as promising biomarkers and predictors of disease severity. In this work, we present detailed structural insights into how human IL-18 and IL-18BP interact thereby completing the structural repertoire of IL-18 in complex with its cognate human receptors and viral decoy receptors. Our findings will support structure-based efforts to either disrupt or enhance the interactions of IL-18 with its cognate receptors for therapeutic purposes.","output":"Structural basis of human IL-18 sequestration by the decoy receptor IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in inflammation and tumor immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between complaints and serum trace elements and oxidative stress levels in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).

Here, we focus on geographic disparities in incidence within Portugal for three age groups of women (30-49; 50-69; 70-84 years). METHODS Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used in cancer surveillance, and these models have recently been extended to allow spatially-varying effects. We apply novel spatial APC models to estimate relative risk and age-adjusted temporal trends at the district level for the 20 districts in Portugal. Our model allows us to report on country-wide trends, but also to investigate geographic disparities between districts and trends within districts. RESULTS Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence was increasing over 1998-2011 for all three age groups and in every district in Portugal. However, we detect spatially-structured between-district heterogeneity in relative risk and age-adjusted trends (Net Drifts) for each of the three age groups, which is most pronounced in the highly-screened (50-69yo) and late-onset (70-84yo) groups of women. CONCLUSIONS We present evidence of disparities in breast cancer incidence at a more granular geographic level than previously reported. Some disparities may be due to latent risk factors, which cannot be accounted for by age, birth year, and geographic location alone.

Thus, as a part of preventive measure, government of India had launched COVID-19vaccines on 16 January 2021.Indeed vaccine hesitancy is one of the most significant barriers for success of any immunization drive. Hence, in view of the recent surge in Covid19 cases in our country, this study was planned to assess the awareness, hesitancy and acceptance attitudes ofCOVID-19vaccine among Medical Students (MS) of Maharashtra. Methodology: This was a cross sectional study. Data was collected using self-reported, structured questionnaire from 356 MS through online Google form. Data were extracted, transferred and analysed using appropriate statistical tool. Results: The study reported 83.43%vaccine acceptance and 16.57% of hesitancy among MS. Furthermore, the main source of COVID-19 vaccine information was social media followed by government web sites. Majority 91.57% of the students were aware of different types of COVID-19vaccines available in our country. However 62.62% MS among acceptance group were willing to get vaccinated through college or university health centre. Beside the main reason for hesitancy was fear of adverse reactions. Moreover the hesitant group was uncertain about safety and efficacy of available vaccines. Conclusion: High acceptance was shown among MS regarding COVID-19 vaccine;however, it is critical to alleviate uncertainties among hesitant MS by continuous education, encouragement and motivation. Consequently, planning and implementation of strategies to further amplify the vaccination rate among medical student is vital to augment the COVID-19 vaccination drive in our country.","output":"Vaccine perception: Acceptance, hesitancy, beliefs and barriers associated with Covid-19 vaccination among medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A blazed chirped Bragg grating in a planar silica waveguide device was used to create an integrated diffractive element for a spectrometer.

Of the 90 who identified their role, 35.6% were patients, 12.2% visitors and 52.2% health care professionals. About 23% of respondents disagreed that one could have H1N1 without fever or fl u-like symptoms, while 14.3% thought influenza could not be caught from an asymptomatic infected person. About 30% perceived the H1N1 death rate as high. From this study, 82.2% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that Singapore's H1N1 responses were essential, while 14.6% found it overdone. In particular, healthcare workers and doctors found their professional work to be inconvenienced. Although more than two-thirds of doctors held this view, an equal proportion agreed the outbreak response was essential.

EXPERT OPINION: While there is no single 'Silver Bullet' to cure COVID-19, we believe that the severely disturbed pathological processes leading to respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 organizing pneumonia will respond to the combination of Methylprednisone, Ascorbic acid, Thiamine, and full anticoagulation with Heparin (MATH+ protocol).We believe that it is no longer ethically acceptable to limit management to 'supportive care' alone, in the face of effective, safe, and inexpensive medications that can effectively treat this disease and thereby reduce the risk of complications and death.","output":"MATH+ protocol for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the scientific rationale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal systemic mycosis that can affect several animal species.

We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study at three of the nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands. We screened health-care workers at the participating hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on clinical symptoms (fever or mild respiratory symptoms) in the 10 days before screening. We obtained epidemiological data through structured interviews with health-care workers and combined this information with data from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples taken from health-care workers and patients. We did an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and patients. FINDINGS: Between March 2 and March 12, 2020, 1796 (15%) of 12a022 health-care workers were screened, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

However, there is limited research examining predictors of pandemic-related changes, and the majority of existing research is cross-sectional in nature, which limits causal inference. Given functional links with disease avoidance processes, individual differences in contamination fear may be especially relevant in predicting responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, the present study prospectively examines contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms as predictors of anxiety and safety behaviors in response to COVID-19 in a student sample (N = 108). To examine specificity, anxiety and safety behaviors in response to seasonal influenza are also examined. In the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), coronavirus-related anxiety was higher than flu-related anxiety (d = 1.38).

This case presents a newly diagnosed paediatric patient with T1DM and DKA who was found to have SARS-CoV-2 without any respiratory symptoms. A 7-year-old girl presented with a history of polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. This presentation was complicated by a 2-day history of fatigue and vomiting. Investigations into the patient's condition confirmed T1DM with DKA. Following the infection control protocol, she underwent screening for SARS-CoV-2, which yielded a positive result. During her hospital stay, she did not develop fever or respiratory symptoms. The ketoacidosis was treated without any complications.

In March 2020, a qualitative content analysis was undertaken of 39 easily accessible online resources that offered advice, tips or guidance relating to mental health or mental wellbeing and COVID-19. Their content was compared to subsequent reports of the mental health impact of the pandemic. Resources frequently focused on anxiety. The content of intervention was typically of a cognitive-behavioral nature, with a significant focus on maintaining social contact. Typically, distress related to the situation was normalized and stigmatizing language was not seen.

METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, survivors of first-ever stroke were evaluated at rehabilitation discharge, 6, 12, and 24 months later. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) duration (minutes/day) assessed with an electronic monitor was the primary outcome. Further outcomes included step count, the number and duration of MVPA and sedentary bouts, cardiovascular risk factors (eg, blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, body mass index), gait speed and endurance, mood, fatigue, and cognition. Associations between physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed with random-effects regression modeling. Associations between baseline characteristics and physical activity at 2 years were explored using regression modeling. RESULTS: Seventy-nine participants (68.4% men) with a mean age of 65 years (SD = 14) and a median gait speed of 1.2 m/s (interquartile range = 0.8-1.4) were included at baseline. Associations were found between higher physical activity (MVPA duration, number and duration of MVPA bouts) and lower body mass index. Better gait speed, endurance, and cognition at baseline were associated with higher MVPA and step count at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Duration and bouts of MVPA are associated with body mass index. Increasing MVPA and bouts of MVPA may be a valuable treatment goal to reduce cardiovascular risk in survivors of stroke. IMPACT: This 2-year study found that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with important cardiovascular risk factors in people who have survived stroke.

Patients with severe arthritis experiencing a state of intolerable pain, could not be left unaddressed. Guidelines published by surgical associations, collaborative surgical author groups including public health organisations had to be modified to suit the Indian scenario and obtain optimal functional outcomes in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 147 patients who underwent arthroplasty during the pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021), for either primary or secondary arthritis, was performed. We assess the efficacy and safety of the newly established Institutional surgical peri-operative protocol at our tertiary care centre in the National Capital Region, India in response to COVID-19 guidelines. The primary outcome measures appraised was 30-day mortality and the secondary outcome measures included length of stay, peri-operative complications and COVID-19 infection. RESULT: The most common indication for arthroplasty during the pandemic was neglected trauma. One patient died, due to myocardial infarction during the follow-up period. About 67% of patients were discharged to their usual residence within 7 days of admission. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 postoperatively, but none required Intensive Care Unit admission.

METHODS: We tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data. RESULTS: CCP usage per admission peaked in Fall 2020, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, after randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in mortality, CCP usage per admission declined steadily to a nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (r = ?0.52, p=0.002) between CCP usage per hospital admission and deaths occurring 2 weeks after admission, and this finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place 1, 2, or 3 weeks after admission. Changes in the number of hospital admissions, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and age of patients could not explain these findings. The retreat from CCP usage might have resulted in as many as 29,000 excess deaths from mid-November 2020 to February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: A strong inverse correlation between CCP use and mortality per admission in the USA provides population-level evidence consistent with the notion that CCP reduces mortality in COVID-19 and suggests that the recent decline in usage could have resulted in excess deaths.

These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","output":"Management of immunosuppressants in the era of coronavirus disease-2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and povidone\\\\iodine (PVP\\\\I) oral antiseptic rinses at clinically recommended concentrations and contact times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, USA\\\\WA1/2020 strain virus stock was prepared prior to testing by growing in Vero 76 cells. The culture media for prepared virus stock was minimum essential medium (MEM) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 g/mL gentamicin. Test compounds consisting of PVP\\\\I oral rinse solutions and H(2)O(2) aqueous solutions were mixed directly with the virus solution so that the final concentration was 50% of the test compound and 50% of the virus solution. Thus PVP\\\\I was tested at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25% and 1.5%, and H(2)O(2) was tested at 3% and 1.5% concentrations to represent clinically recommended concentrations. Ethanol and water were evaluated in parallel as standard positive and negative controls. All samples were tested at contact periods of 15 seconds and 30 seconds. Surviving virus from each sample was then quantified by standard end\\\\point dilution assay and the log reduction value of each compound compared to the negative control was calculated. RESULTS: After the 15\\\\second and 30\\\\second contact times, PVP\\\\I oral antiseptic rinse at all 3 concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25% and 1.5% completely inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in four hospitals in China from January 22, 2020 to April 15, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data of the patients with COVID-19 were collected. The independent risk factors related to the severity of and death due to COVID-19 were identified with a multivariate logistic regression; a nomogram and prediction model were established. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and predictive accuracy were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Results: In total, 582 patients with COVID-19, including 116 patients with severe disease, were enrolled. Their comorbidities, body temperature, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet (PLT) count, and levels of total bilirubin (Tbil), creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), and albumin (Alb) were independent risk factors for severe disease. A nomogram was generated based on these eight variables with a predictive accuracy of 85.9% and an AUROC of 0.858 (95% CI, 0.823C0.893). Based on the nomogram, the CANPT score was established with cut-off values of 12 and 16. The percentages of patients with severe disease in the groups with CANPT scores <12, 12, and <16, and 16 were 4.15, 27.43, and 69.64%, respectively. Seventeen patients died.

For students to pursue learning opportunities, the education system must improve. Augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) provide a promising future for the enhancement of medical education. This review article aims to evaluate the benefits and efficacy of AR and VR, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Multiple peer-reviewed, randomized trials were synthesized into a review study investigating the efficacy, benefit, and use of VR and AR for medical education. The reviewed studies included medical and graduate-level students as participants and aimed to support the use of AR and VR as an educational adjunct. The results of these trials support the use of additional technology in medical education. Results The COVID-19 pandemic propelled medical schools, educators, and students into a world of total computerized learning. This pandemic acted as a necessary push to implement novel, untested technologies into the educational sector. Previous research demonstrates that AR and VR can confront these unfamiliar challenges and allow for a safe and beneficial COVID-19 education, consisting of socially-distanced and low-risk patient-care practice. Conclusions The benefits of continuous, safe learning outweigh the potential technological challenges of implementing AR and VR into medical education. During the pandemic, the medical community is faced with teaching students many skills necessary to become adept medical practitioners. Although the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity for the implementation of new technologies, virtual instruction does not have to end beyond this crisis. Virtual technology can teach medical students interpersonal skills such as empathy, engaging in difficult conversations, and delivering bad news.

Reaching the zenith of their political ascendancy in the immediately aftermath of the 2011 Arab Uprisings, it is clear that Islamism is on the wane across the region. Opinion polls demonstrated that the Arab street, in particular the youth, are becoming more secular, less conservative in their attitudes and more suspicious of the role of religion in the public sphere. What is driving this disenchantment with Islamist parties relates to their aligning themselves with anti-democratic forces, the endemic corruption and nepotism they have demonstrated once in office, their inability to govern and their internal divisions. Our multivariate empirics of the support rates for Political Islam in the region relied on data from the Arab Barometer survey (5). If the people of the entire Arab world had a free vote in a referendum, the following rules and regulations still would gain an absolute majority: Against a marriage of a female with a man who does not pray. Terrorism against the USA is a logical consequence of US interference in the region. Males are better political leaders. The USA, the UK and Israel pose the greatest threat to the stability and well-being of the region. Banks should not be allowed to charge interest. More than a third of Arab opinion still supports, among others, the following contentions: In favour of Sharia using physical punishments. A woman cannot be prime minister/president. In society, non-Muslims rights should be inferior. Rejecting neighbours C people of a different religion. Sharia should restrict womens role. From the Arab Barometer data, we constructed parametric and non-parametric indices of Overcoming Islamism and of Political Islam. The indices show a very high correlation with each other. The country values of the Index components are found in Table 7.2. Islamism is defined as high values along our 24 indicators across the board. Table 7.3 reports our UNDP-type Index Overcoming Islamism based on the valid country-level Arab Barometer results with 24 variables, aggregated with equal weights. Tunisia, according to Table 7.3, is the country whose population is rendering least support for Islamist worldviews, followed by Lebanon and Iraq. Yemen, Sudan and Algeria are the three Arab nations, whose population still lends biggest across-the-board support for the 24 Islamist positions under consideration here. We could show the close relationship between support of the most salient global Islamist leader today, Turkish President Erdogan, and Political Islam among the interviewed Arab publics. Support for Political Islam is also still very clearly connected to Anti-Westernism in the region. Political Islamist hatred against the West now also features the United Arab Emirates with its close cooperation with Western countries and its world class Universities as a victim of this prejudice. As a rule, the advancement of education reduces the extent of support for Political Islam.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the types of discrimination and worries experienced by Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States during the pandemic, as well as factors that were associated with everyday discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination that the Asian community may face. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 235 people who identified themselves as Asian or Asian American and resided in the United States completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Our study suggested that up to a third of Asians surveyed had experienced some type of discrimination. Pooling the responses \\"very often,\\" \\"often,\\" and \\"sometimes,\\" the percentages for each experienced discrimination type ranged between 14%-34%. In total, 49%-58% of respondents expressed concerns about discrimination in the future. The most frequently experienced discrimination types, as indicated by responses \\"very often\\" and \\"often,\\" were \\"people act as if they think you are dangerous\\" (25/235, 11%) and \\"being treated with less courtesy or respect\\" (24/235, 10%). About 14% (32/235) of individuals reported very often, often, or sometimes being threatened or harassed. In addition, social media use was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination (?=.18, P=.01) and having concerns about future episodes of discrimination the community may face (?=.20, P=.005). Use of print media was also positively associated with experiencing discrimination (?=.31, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided important empirical evidence regarding the various types of discrimination Asians residing in the United States experienced or worried about during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between media sources and the perception of racial biases in this group was also identified. We noted the role of social media in reinforcing the perception of discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination among Asians during this outbreak. Our results indicate several practical implications for public health agencies. To reduce discrimination against Asians during the pandemic, official sources and public health professionals should be cognizant of the possible impacts of stigmatizing cues in media reports on activating racial biases. Furthermore, Asians or Asian Americans could also be informed that using social media to obtain COVID-19 information is associated with an increase in concerns about future discrimination, and thus they may consider approaching this media source with caution.","output":"Exploring the Role of Media Sources on COVID-19-Related Discrimination Experiences and Concerns Among Asian People in the United States: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Affecting ~1% of the world population, schizophrenia is known as one of the costliest and most burdensome diseases worldwide. Antipsychotic medications are the main treatment for schizophrenia to control psychotic symptoms and efficiently prevent new crises. However, due to poor compliance, 74% of patients with schizophrenia discontinue medication within 1.5 years, which severely affects recovery and prognosis. Through research on intra and interindividual variability based on a psychopathologyCneuropsychologyCneuroimageCgeneticsCphysiology-biochemistry model, our main objective is to investigate an optimized and individualized antipsychotic-treatment regimen and precision treatment for first-episode schizophrenic patients. Methods and Analysis: The study is performed in 20 representative hospitals in China. Three subprojects are included. In subproject 1, 1,800 first-episode patients with schizophrenia are randomized into six different antipsychotic monotherapy groups (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and haloperidol) for an 8-week treatment. By identifying a set of potential biomarkers associated with antipsychotic treatment response, we intend to build a prediction model, which includes neuroimaging, epigenetics, environmental stress, neurocognition, eye movement, electrophysiology, and neurological biochemistry indexes. In subproject 2, apart from verifying the prediction model established in subproject 1 based on an independent cohort of 1,800 first-episode patients with schizophrenia, we recruit patients from a verification cohort who did not get an effective response after an 8-week antipsychotic treatment into a randomized double-blind controlled trial with minocycline (200 mg per day) and sulforaphane (3 tables per day) to explore add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Two hundred forty participants are anticipated to be enrolled for each group. In subproject 3, we tend to carry out one trial to construct an intervention strategy for metabolic syndrome induced by antipsychotic treatment and another one to build a prevention strategy for patients at a high risk of metabolic syndrome, which combines metformin and lifestyle intervention. Two hundred participants are anticipated to be enrolled for each group.

EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.","output":"Prospects for detecting early warning signals in discrete event sequence data: Application to epidemiological incidence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) can take a serious course under immunosuppression.

Sequence comparisons revealed that 3c genes of animals with FIP were heavily affected by nucleotide deletions and point mutations compared to animals infected with FECV; these alterations resulted either in early termination or destruction of the translation initiation codon. Two ascites-derived samples of cats with FIP which displayed no alterations of ORF3c harboured mutations in the S2 domain of the S protein gene which resulted in amino acid exchanges or deletions. Moreover, changes in 3c were often accompanied by mutations in S2. In contrast, in samples obtained from faeces of healthy cats, the ORF3c was never affected by such mutations.

We found that the early regional response was slow and lack of unity (JanuaryCFebruary 2020). Extensive early measures taken by each member state are the key to the success to curb the spread of the virus. Although, during March and April 2020, ASEAN has reconvened and utilised its existing health regional mechanism to try to have a coherent response to COVID-19 impacts. Strengthening future collaboration should be implemented by recognizing that there is a more coherent, multi sectoral, multi stakeholders and whole-of-ASEAN Community approach in ensuring ASEAN's timely and effective response to the pandemic. Finally, we call for the COVID-19 recovery should allow for healthy, just, resilient and sustainable ASEAN.","output":"COVID-19 and the ASEAN responses: Comparison and analysis through policy science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During this time ofintensified hardship and disruption due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities, practitioners, and state and local governments have had to rapidly implement and adapt strategies that support mental health and wellbeing during a global pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and at least half of the top 10 leading causes of death have been associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). A number of established risk factors for suicide and ACEs may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, including loneliness and the lack of connectedness. METHOD: This article briefly considers the effects of COVID-19 on social connection and outlines the importance of adapting and developing programming and resources that address suicide and ACEs prevention during a time of infrastructure disruption. Practical Applications: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ways that many individuals are able to safely interact and socially connect due to public health prevention strategies implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. Local, city, and state government, community organizations, and public health and medical practitioners should consider the adaptation and development of existing and new programming, resources, and activities that support and strengthen social connection. In addition to implementing programs, policies may help address systemic and structural barriers to social connection, such as access to parks and open space, public transportation, or digital connectivity.","output":"Special Report from the CDC: Strengthening social connections to prevent suicide and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs): Actions and opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary immune-related adverse events represent rare but potentially severe side effects of immunotherapies. Diagnosis is often challenging, as symptoms and imaging features are not speci?c and may mimic other lung diseases, thus potentially delaying appropriate patient management. In this setting, an accurate imaging evaluation is essential for a prompt detection as well as correct management of these drug-induced lung diseases.

Here, we hypothesized that women with AFLP exhibit elevated PlGF production in comparison to women with preeclampsia or hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome. Making use of the well-known mathematical formulas describing drug-receptor interactions, we established that serum total PlGF could be accurately predicted from sFlt-1 and free PlGF levels (n=42; mean calculated K(D) of 50 pmol/L), yielding similar values as the previously published method of thermal dissociation of the sFlt-1-PlGF complexes (r=0.94, P<0.0001). We found that median levels of free PlGF were significantly lower in women with preeclampsia (n=13; 117pg/mL) or hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome (n=12; 59 pg/mL) compared with women without preeclampsia (n=11; 349pg/mL, P<0.0001). In contrast, median total PlGF did not differ between women with no preeclampsia, preeclampsia, and hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome (354 versus 435 versus 344pg/mL), whereas it was markedly elevated in AFLP compared with all groups (2054 pg/mL, P<0.0001). Furthermore, in AFLP, both sFlt-1 and total PlGF declined rapidly postdelivery, with significantly higher predelivery total PlGF (n=12; median, 2054 pg/mL) than postpartum levels (n=14; median, 163pg/mL, P<0.0001), suggesting that in AFLP, PlGF is largely placenta-derived. Collectively, our findings indicate that like sFlt-1, PlGF production is significantly upregulated in AFLP, mainly originating from the placenta. Importantly, total PlGF can now be easily calculated from already available free PlGF and sFlt-1 levels, allowing subsequent evaluation of other groups in whom PlGF is altered.","output":"Accurate Prediction of Total PlGF (Placental Growth Factor) From Free PlGF and sFlt-1 (Soluble Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1): Evidence for Markedly Elevated PlGF Levels in Women With Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the race for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, even before its commercialization, part of the population has already shown a growing fear of its application.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole.","output":"Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Akt, a crucial protein involved in a variety of signaling pathways in cancer, acts as an important regulator of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and provides curative option for the related drugs development.

In contrast, ectopic Akt-induced overexpression significantly abrogated inhibitory effects of HTBPI on cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, high p-Akt (Thr 308) expression is collated with liver tumor formation and poor survival in HCC patients. In conclusions, HTBPI impeded HCC progress through regulation of apoptosis and autophagy machinery via interaction with p-Akt (Thr 308).

Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS), the most common cause of flaccid motor deficit with acute or subacute onset, is associated in approximately 2/3 of cases with a history of microbial, predominantly viral, infection. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the presence of patients with both peripheral nervous system pathology and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection raised questions among researchers whether there may be a possible link between the two entities. Thus, this narrative review aims to provide a clearer perspective on this topic, addressing several issues. Methods. The authors performed independent research of the available literature in the most important electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct). After applying the exclusion criteria, the reviewers focused on the most relevant articles published during the last 18 months, focusing on epidemiological and pathophysiological data regarding GBS and COVID-19. Results. In the first part, a summary of the most important results from the literature on the epidemiological situation in different parts of the world was conducted. Subsequently, possible immunological theories are presented in order to explain the epidemiological association between GBS and COVID-19 infection. Finally, the authors propose new research directions on the topic, discussing the issue of the COVID-19 vaccine, with its short and long term effects, and possible correlations with peripheral nerve pathology. Conclusion. Neurological manifestation in COVID-19 may represent a challenge for the clinician, and with growing numbers of unprecedented cases of peripheral nerve pathology associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus being reported, further research is urgently needed. ? 2021, Editura Medicala.

Indocyanine green near-infrared video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has been adopted for objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion but is thus far not used on a routine basis. Therefore, we investigated its intraoperative impact on decision-making and postoperative outcome. METHODS: From January 2017 to June 2019, 88 consecutive adipo- or fasciocutaneus free flaps were performed in conjunction with intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA. Free flap tissue perfusion was first assessed clinically and then compared with ICG-NIR-VA findings. Based on the results, the decision for intraoperative trimming of critically perfused flap zones was made. The way of decision-making, flap success, and failure rates as well as intra- and postoperative complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall free flap success rate was 92.0%. Partial flap necrosis occurred in five cases (5.7%) and total flap necrosis in two cases (2.3%). ICG-NIR-VA aided decision-making and flap design in 34 cases (38.6%) and led to complication-free postoperative courses. When ICG-NIR-VA was relied on (82 out of 88 flaps; 93.2%), there was no unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis (overestimation). When ICG-NIR-VA was not relied on (6 out of 88 flaps; 6.8%), there were five cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis and one case of uneventful healing (underestimation). The sensitivity of ICG-NIR-VA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.6-100) and the specificity was 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3-100) with a positive predictive value of 87.5% (95% CI: 52.9-99.4) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95.4-100). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA objectified free flap perfusion and thus refined surgical decision-making on flap design in all cases. It could always predict tissue necrosis and subjectively improved outcomes in free flap surgery at our institution. Furthermore, it could be easily implemented in intraoperative routine, only adding minimal additional operative time.","output":"The Impact of Indocyanine-Green Fluorescence Angiography on Intraoperative Decision-Making and Postoperative Outcome in Free Flap Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases because of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID 19), experienced in the sports community, may cause athletes, technical teams, employees, and professionals to experience coronavirus anxiety Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the anxiety of Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) in terms of amateur and professional athletes Two hundred fifty-six active athletes (187 males and 69 females) who studied at the Faculty of Sport Sciences, Kutahya Dumlupinar University, voluntarily participated in this research The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Anxiety Scale developed by Tekkursun ve Demir et al (2020) was used in the research Parametric tests, as T-Test and One Way ANOVA tests were applied According to the results, significant differences were determined according to gender, athletes level, roommate during the pandemic (p0 05) However, according to exercising at home, there was no statistically significant difference following the news of coronavirus in social media and age variables (p0 05) According to the findings obtained, it is thought that the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) anxiety experienced by athletes, whether or not there is a branch of sports that requires contact, will be observed in athletes in different variables and this will be reflected in the preparation process in training and performance in the field and that the athletes may be in aggressive behaviors in psychological pressure In this process, it was considered essential to examine the athletes' concerns when deciding to postpone some leagues given by the federations to register or cancel as they did from the pandemic process In this context, some findings were revealed","output":"Amat?r ve Profesyonel Sporcularin Yeni Tip Koronavirse (Covid-19) Yakalanma Kayg?larinin ncelenmesi - Y?netsel Karar Boyutu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Cancer-related biopsychosocial distress is highly prevalent across the cancer care continuum. The implementation of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19 is the significant decrease in screening patients for biopsychosocial symptom burden. METHODS: Given that screening for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre. Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In this paper, we present pre- and post-COVID data on the frequency of distress screening and its impact on patient care. RESULTS: A review of pre- and post-COVID-19 screening for distress questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and received less resources and referrals to supportive care. CONCLUSION: The rapid integration of virtual care without the inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person clinic patients) received different levels of care and interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals. Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support distress screening and best patient-centric care.","output":"Lessons learned about virtual cancer care and distress screening in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

It is a complex process involving the action of several viral and host proteins in order to perform RNA polymerization, proofreading and final capping. This review provides an update of the structural and functional data on the key actors of the replicatory machinery of SARS-CoV-2, to fill the gaps in the currently available structural data, which is mainly obtained through homology modeling. Moreover, learning from similar viruses, we collect data from the literature to reconstruct the pattern of interactions among the protein actors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase machinery. Here, an important role is played by co-factors such as Nsp8 and Nsp10, not only as allosteric activators but also as molecular connectors that hold the entire machinery together to enhance the efficiency of RNA replication.","output":"A Structural View of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication Machinery: RNA Synthesis, Proofreading and Final Capping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved drug that has shown antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses in recent years.

We identified an unexpected antagonistic effect of FGFs on the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGF receptor signaling in keratinocytes promoted the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and proteins in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, FGF7 or FGF10 treatment of keratinocytes suppressed ISG expression under homeostatic conditions and in response to IFN or poly(I:C) treatment. FGF-mediated ISG suppression was independent of IFN receptors, occurred at the transcriptional level, and required FGF receptor kinase and proteasomal activity. It is not restricted to keratinocytes and functionally relevant, since FGFs promoted the replication of herpes simplex virus I (HSV-1), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Zika virus. Most importantly, inhibition of FGFR signaling blocked HSV-1 replication in cultured human keratinocytes and in mice.

Energy is a critical infrastructure for any modern society, and its reliable functioning is essential for all economic sectors and for the well-being of everybody. Uncertainty in terms of the availability of information, namely reliable data to make predictions and to plan for investment as well as for other actions of stakeholders in the energy markets is one of the factors with the highest influence on energy security. This uncertainty can be connected with many factors, such as the availability of reliable data or actions of stakeholders themselves. For example, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed negative impacts of uncertainty on decision-making processes and markets. At the time point when the market participants started to receive real-time information about the situation, the energy markets began to ease.

This was revised in response to our ongoing clinical experience and changes in guidance from medical and public health organisations. Following 10 weeks of clinical practice, we formally tested the SOP using point-of-care simulation to enable optimisation for a potential second surge. Our high-fidelity simulation of a COVID-19-positive parturient requiring an emergency caesarean was facilitated by the simulation team in our obstetric unit. It was designed to test the performance and safety of our SOP as well as staff performance. We used the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis tool (a systematic, prospective method of process mapping) to identify how a complex task might fail and assess the relative impact of different failures. The decision-to-delivery was 17 minutes, which we considered to be successful. However, a number of operational deficiencies were identified. The main failures related to lack of situational awareness, ill-fitting personal protective equipment and difficulties communicating between theatre and the neonatal teams located outside, posing serious potential risks to safe neonatal care. Subsequently, we have modified our SOP to include a communication check, implemented communication training for the neonatal team and organised further simulation training for theatre staff unfamiliar with COVID-19 considerations.","output":"Failure modes and effects analysis to assess COVID-19 protocols in the management of obstetric emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through analysis of the ideal gas, we construct a random walk that on average matches the standard susceptible-infective-removed (SIR) model. We show that the most widely referenced parameter, the 'basic reproduction number' (R0), is fundamentally connected to the relative odds of increasing or decreasing the infectives population. As a consequence, for R0 > 1 the probability that no outbreak occurs is 1/R0. In stark contrast to a deterministic SIR, when R0 = 1.5 the random walk has a 67% chance of avoiding outbreak. Thus, an alternative, probabilistic, interpretation of R0 arises, which provides a novel estimate of the critical population density {gamma}/r without fitting SIR models. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 in the United States is consistent with our model and attempt an estimate of {gamma}/r. In doing so, we uncover a significant source of bias in public data reporting. Data are aggregated on political boundaries, which bear no concern for dispersion of population density. We show that this introduces bias in fits and parameter estimates, a concern for understanding fundamental virus parameters and for policy making. Anonymized data at the resolution required for contact tracing would afford access to {gamma}/r without fitting. The random walk SIR developed here highlights the intuition that any epidemic is stochastic and recovers all the key parameter values noted by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.","output":"What can the ideal gas say about global pandemics?

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of depression seems to be increasing in the general population.It is likely that depression will be even more of a problem for CVD patients in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.New studies confirm the independent association of depression with later incident CVD, although perhaps not as strong as suggested by some previous studies.Depression seems to be becoming even more prevalent in CVD patients, with new data for stroke and peripheral arterial disease patients.Cardiologists rarely screen for depression and most do not believe that they have a responsibility for detecting or treating depression.There are new data suggesting that patients who are more in control of their lives have better outcomes and that change is possible.

Given the worldwide vaccination campaign, the understanding of the vaccine-induced versus COVID-19-induced immunity will contribute to adjusting vaccine dosing strategies and speeding-up vaccination efforts. METHODS: Anti-spike-RBD IgGs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) titers were measured in BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinated participants (n = 250); we also investigated humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated individuals (n = 21) of this cohort 5 months post-vaccination and assayed NAbs levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n = 60) with moderate or severe disease, as well as in COVID-19 recovered patients (n = 34). RESULTS: We found that one (boosting) dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine triggers robust immune (i.e., anti-spike-RBD IgGs and NAbs) responses in COVID-19 convalescent healthy recipients, while na?ve recipients require both priming and boosting shots to acquire high antibody titers. Severe COVID-19 triggers an earlier and more intense (versus moderate disease) immune response in hospitalized patients; in all cases, however, antibody titers remain at high levels in COVID-19 recovered patients. Although virus infection promotes an earlier and more intense, versus priming vaccination, immune response, boosting vaccination induces antibody titers significantly higher and likely more durable versus COVID-19. In support, high anti-spike-RBD IgGs/NAbs titers along with spike (vaccine encoded antigen) specific T cell clones were found in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively, of vaccinated individuals 5 months post-vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support vaccination efficacy, also suggesting that vaccination likely offers more protection than natural infection.

Using peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and Praat analysis, the participants' vocal functions were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Vocal function was compared among the groups pre- and post-test; the therapeutic singing group showed statistically significant improvement in all vocal parameters: PEF, maximum phonation time, voice intensity (intensity), fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The general singing group showed improvement only in F0, jitter, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The control group showed an overall reduction in all vocal functions, with a significant decrease in PEF and intensity, and a decrease in jitter and shimmer.

A number of institutions have developed a COVID-free pathway for elective surgery patients in order to minimize the risk of viral transmission. The aim of this study is to identify the perioperative viral transmission rate in elective orthopaedic patients following the restart of elective surgery. METHODS: This is a prospective study of 121 patients who underwent elective orthopaedic procedures through a COVID-free pathway. All patients underwent a 14-day period of self-isolation, had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of surgery, and underwent surgery at a COVID-free site. Baseline patient characteristics were recorded including age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index (BMI), procedure, and admission type. Patients were contacted 14 days following discharge to determine if they had had a positive COVID-19 test (COVID-confirmed) or developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (COVID-19-presumed). RESULTS: The study included 74 females (61.2%) and 47 males (38.8%) with a mean age of 52.3 years  17.6 years (18 to 83 years). The ASA grade was grade I in 26 patients (21.5%), grade II in 70 patients (57.9%), grade III in 24 patients (19.8%), and grade IV in one patient (0.8%). A total of 18 patients (14.9%) had underlying cardiovascular disease, 17 (14.0%) had pulmonary disease, and eight (6.6%) had diabetes mellitus. No patients (0%) had a positive COVID-19 test in the postoperative period. One patient (0.8%) developed anosmia postoperatively without respiratory symptoms or a fever. The patient did not undergo a COVID-19 test and self-isolated for seven days. Her symptoms resolved within a few days. CONCLUSION: The development of a COVID-free pathway for elective orthopaedic patients results in very low viral transmission rates. While both surgeons and patients should remain vigilant, elective surgery can be safely restarted using dedicated pathways and procedures.

Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block PCD in the medial neuroblast lineage in Drosophila melanogaster, which results in the production of undead neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these undead neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans which have lost flight during evolution we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development.

We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24ah after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on days 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44aM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity, and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower than or equal to 150.44aM and 4.1% with levels above 150.44aM (P: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater than or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL-6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood.

In contrast, Dengue virus infection is enhanced in cells expressing either attachment factor. The West Nile virus envelope (E) protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154, whereas Dengue virus E contains sites at residues 153 and 67. We introduced a glycosylation site at position 67 into West Nile virus E. Reporter virus particles pseudotyped with this E protein infected cells using either CD209 or CD209L. We also introduced glycosylation sites at several novel positions. All sites allowed CD209L-mediated infection, but only a subset promoted CD209 use. As seen for other viruses, mannose-rich glycans on West Nile virus were required for its interactions with CD209. Surprisingly, however, mannose-rich glycans were not required for CD209L-mediated infection. Complex glycans, particularly N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures, were able to mediate reporter virus particle interactions with CD209L. We propose that CD209L recognizes glycosylated flaviviruses with broad specificity, whereas CD209 is selective for flaviviruses bearing mannose-rich glycans.

We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than universal random testing, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)).

Type I IFNs are produced after viral recognition by pathogen recognition receptors, which trigger a cascade of activation events. Human and mouse studies have shown that defective type I IFNs induction may hamper the ability to control viral infections. In humans, moderate to high-effect variants have been identified in individuals with particularly severe complications following viral infection. In mice, functional studies using knock-out alleles have revealed the specific role of most genes of the IFN pathway. Here, we review the role of the molecular partners of the type I IFNs induction pathway and their implication in the control of viral infections and of their complications.","output":"Host genetic susceptibility to viral infections: the role of type I interferon induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has forced assisted living facilities (ALF) to implement strict social isolation for residents. Social isolation in the geriatric population is known to negatively impact health. Here, we describe how ALFs in Rhode Island utilized device donations received from Connect for COVID-19, a nationwide nonprofit organization which has mobilized medical students to gather devices for donations to care centers. METHODS Rhode Island ALFs were contacted to determine if they were interested in receiving smart device donations. After donations were made, an impact survey was electronically administered. Primary Results: A total of 11 facilities completed the survey with a response rate of 24% (11/46). The facilities were located throughout all five counties in Rhode Island, with the majority located in Providence County. All but one of the facilities that responded to the survey (n=10, 90.9%) have used the devices to allow residents to video-call their family members. Seven responses (63.6%) indicated that devices were used for more than one purpose. Primary Conclusions: Smart devices were well received by Rhode Island ALFs and used for purposes beyond video conference calls. ALFs should consider advertising the need for devices to encourage community donations. Future studies should investigate the direct impact that digital connectivity has had on Rhode Island ALF residents.","output":"Experiences of Rhode Island Assisted Living Facilities in Connecting Residents with Families through Technology During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the ability of Echinacea purpurea to prevent infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV-39).

The secondary aim was to assess if the albumin gradient (ALBg) is a reliable criterion for differentiating exudates from transudates in patients with pleural effusion thought to be transudative by clinical criteria but identified as exudative by Light's criteria. Nineteen client-owned cats with pleural effusion were studied. The aetiology of the pleural effusion was used to establish the pathophysiology of its formation. Parameters measured or calculated undergoing statistical analysis included Light's criteria, total protein and total nucleated cell count in the pleural effusions, and the ALBg. Based on the pathophysiology of fluid formation there were seven transudates caused by increased hydrostatic pressure and 12 exudates. There was a significant difference in the accuracy of the Light's criteria in correctly classifying origin of the pleural fluid formation compared with the traditional veterinary classification (84% vs 53%). ALBg values were significantly different between transudates and exudates. One of the three transudates misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria was correctly identified as a transudate by the ALBg. In conclusion, pleural effusion should be classified as either a transudate or an exudate using Light's criteria. In cats with pleural effusion thought to be transudative by clinical criteria, but identified as exudative by Light's criteria, the ALBg may further help in correctly differentiating exudates from transudates.","output":"Diagnostic value of Light's criteria and albumin gradient in classifying the pathophysiology of pleural effusion formation in cats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 31, 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of Coronavirus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) It was initially reported from Wuhan, China This novel virus causes atypical clinical presentations that differs from other viral pneumonias;in fact, some clinical aspects of infection are not cleared today We present the case of a 69-year-old man with a 2-week history of dyspnea and hemoptysis He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction On day 11 postadmission, the case's condition improved significantly, with his oxygen saturation rising and lymphopenia subsiding His dyspnea gradually decreased in severity;furthermore, hemoptysis was controlled after treatment This case indicates the complexity and variety of pneumonia complications caused by COVID-19 infection We must have a high clinical suspicion in management of suspected cases especially in patients with novel clinical presentations such as our case in a pandemic Thus, hemothorax due to viral lung parenchymal destruction can be a complication of COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"Hemothorax: a rare presentation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pandemic caused by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain threatening to women and children, while clinical evidences regarding women during pregnancy, puerperium and lactation periods are limited.

Knowing how to reduce burnout is important because that of care workers is associated with the quality of client care, worker productivity, and job turnover. Patients and Methods: The participants included 44 care workers who worked for elderly care facilities in rural Fukuoka. They were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: control, yoga, or mindfulness. In the yoga intervention group, a certified yoga instructor taught a 60-minute yoga session each week for six weeks. In the mindfulness group, an experienced medical doctor instructed a mindful meditation program for the same length. Participants were asked to complete the Japanese Burnout Scale (JBS), and the research team collected the level of -amylase in saliva using NIPRO: T-110-N pre- and post-interventions. Results: MANOVA was performed with each intervention (control, yoga, mindfulness) as the independent variable on the three subscales of the JBS (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement) and a biomarker of stress level (-amylase). The results indicated a significant main effect of interventions, and a follow-up ANOVA showed a significant effect of interventions on emotional exhaustion and personal achievement. Conclusion: The results indicate that practicing mindful meditation or yoga for 60 minutes once a week for six weeks can reduce care workers burnout. This study was notable because the biomarker of stress also improved.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study whether EOL discussions were offered and to what degree patients were alone at time of death when dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), comparing deaths in nursing homes and hospitals. METHODS: The national Swedish Register of Palliative Care was used. All expected deaths from COVID-19 in nursing homes and hospitals were compared with, and contrasted to, deaths in a reference population (deaths in 2019). RESULTS: A total of 1346 expected COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes (n = 908) and hospitals (n = 438) were analyzed. Those who died were of a more advanced age in nursing homes (mean 86.4 years) and of a lower age in hospitals (mean 80.7 years) (P < 0.0001). Fewer EOL discussions with patients were held compared with deaths in 2019 (74% vs. 79%, P < 0.001), and dying with someone present was much more uncommon (59% vs. 83%, P < 0.0001). In comparisons between nursing homes and hospital deaths, more patients dying in nursing homes were women (56% vs. 37%, P < 0.0001), and significantly fewer had a retained ability to express their will during the last week of life (54% vs. 89%, P < 0.0001). Relatives were present at time of death in only 13% and 24% of the cases in nursing homes and hospitals, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding figures for staff were 52% and 38% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dying from COVID-19 negatively affects the possibility of holding an EOL discussion and the chances of dying with someone present. This has considerable social and existential consequences for both patients and families.","output":"Dying From COVID-19: Loneliness, End-of-Life Discussions, and Support for Patients and Their Families in Nursing Homes and Hospitals.

Respite care (RC) is a commonly used short-term inpatient service. The provision of RC can serve as a link between home care and institutional care and can help to stabilize the care provided at home. During RC, the everyday functional skills of PwD can be improved or stabilized through systematic mobility training. However, no specific mobility programme exists for this setting. The aim of the DESKK study was to develop and test a mobility training programme for PwD in the RC setting in Germany. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted in a specialized RC centre for PwD. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed using a mixed methods design. RESULTS: The DESKK mobility programme may be introduced in the RC setting depending on the required time and professional resources. The mobility programme had a high acceptance rate among the staff involved. Ongoing documentation of the mobility exercises were challenging. During their stay (2-4 weeks), the physical function level of the included PwD (n = 20) increased regarding leg strength, gross motor coordination, fine coordination of the fingers and hand strength.

This method is based on independent component analysis (ICA), which is not capable of extracting components independently. Therefore, we propose the use of the maximum approximate information negative entropy optimization model in order to improve the ICA algorithms independent principal component extraction ability and obtain better non-Gaussian physical source signal separation results. The improved ICA algorithm is used for the blind source separation of the thermal parameters of peak-load-regulation nuclear power units. A series of stationary physical source functions and a series of non-stationary noise signals are obtained. Then, according to the specific signal format and data volume of the nuclear power parameter signal, the network parameters of the random forest algorithm are determined, giving rise to the fault diagnosis model. Finally, the real-time operation data of an 1121 MW nuclear power unit are used to complete the training and fault diagnosis of the random forest network and analyze the diagnosis results. The results indicate that the model can effectively mine the abnormal sample points of thermal parameters and classify the fault type of the thermal sensor during peak load operation of the nuclear power unit.

Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half).

DESIGN: Online survey of UK palliative/hospice services' response to COVID-19. Closed-ended responses are reported descriptively. Open-ended responses were analysed using a thematic Framework approach using the Social Ecological Model to understand challenges. RESPONDENTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven services. RESULTS: More direct advance care planning was provided by 38% of services, and 59% provided more support to others. Some challenges to advance care planning pre-dated the pandemic, whilst others were specific to/exacerbated by COVID-19. Challenges are demonstrated through six themes: complex decision making in the face of a new infectious disease; maintaining a personalised approach; COVID-19-specific communication difficulties; workload and pressure; sharing information; and national context of fear and uncertainty. Two themes demonstrate changes made to support: adapting local processes and adapting local structures. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals and healthcare providers need to ensure advance care planning is individualised by tailoring it to the values, priorities, and ethnic/cultural/religious context of each person.

Despite the successful development, the main limitation of most existing methods lies in the assumption that the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, i.e. the same machine under identical condition. However, this assumption is difficult to be met in the real industries, since the diagnostic model is generally expected to be applied on new machines. In order to address this issue, a deep learning-based cross-machine health identification method is proposed for industrial vacuum pumps, which are of great importance in the manufacturing industry but have received far less research attention in the literature. Generalized diagnostic features can be learnt using the proposed domain adaptation technique with maximum mean discrepancy metric.

LncRNA MEG3 expression was elevated in ARDS sepsis patients compared with non-ARDS sepsis patients, then the following receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis disclosed that lncRNA MEG3 predicted ARDS risk (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.775), which was further validated as an independent risk factor by multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG3 was positively correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, sequential organ failure assessment score, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein, while negatively correlated with albumin in sepsis patients. Additionally, lncRNA MEG3 was elevated in 28-day deaths compared with 28-day survivors, and it predicted 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients (AUC = 0.708) by ROC curve analysis. CONCLUSION LncRNA MEG3 might represent as a valuable biomarker for individualizing prevention strategies against ARDS and improving prognosis in sepsis.","output":"The value of circulating long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 as a predictor of higher acute respiratory distress syndrome risk and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Most studies on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among children and adolescents pertain to adolescents and Indian data on childhood-onset OCD are scant. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical profile of OCD among children and adolescents with onset before the age of 12 years. METHODS: Children and adolescents who attended the outpatient clinic with a clinical diagnosis of OCD were included in the study. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) was used to assess the phenomenology and severity of OCD. The diagnoses of OCD and comorbid disorders were based on DSM5 diagnostic criteria. Children with the onset of symptoms before the age of 12 years were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 46 children with OCD, 31 (16 boys and 15 girls) had onset before the age of 12 years. The youngest child was 6 years old and in 29% of children, OCD symptoms began before the age of 8 years. Family history of OCD, other mental illnesses, and tics disorder was present in 48.4%, 29%, and 12.9% of children, respectively. Comorbid tics disorder was present in 12 (38.6%) children and 1 (3%) child each had depression and conduct disorder. Common obsessions and compulsions were obsessions of contamination (77.4%) and washing and cleaning compulsions (87.1%). Miscellaneous obsessions and compulsions occurred in 25.8% and 77.4% of children, respectively. CONCLUSION: OCD is not uncommon in young children.

Timely availability of effective influenza vaccine will be critical to mitigate the next influenza pandemic. The mission of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop medical countermeasures against pandemics, including influenza and other health security threats.Areas covered. Despite considerable gains in pandemic vaccine preparedness since 2009, old and new challenges threaten the pandemic influenza response capabilities of the U.S. Government: insufficient U.S.-based vaccine production, two-dose vaccination regimen, logistically complex adjuvanted formulation, and sustained surge manufacturing capacity despite no commercial market for pandemic vaccines. Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has re-exposed these gaps in preparedness and response, previous investments into flexible influenza vaccine technologies proved to be critical to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development.Expert opinion. BARDA addresses these challenges by implementing a pandemic influenza vaccine strategy with two key goals: 1) accelerating vaccine development and production (faster) and 2) improving vaccine performance (better). This strategy involves an end-to-end approach, including increasing manufacturing and fill-finish capacity; improving release testing speed; and funding clinical trials to improve current vaccine utilization.

The persistence of potentially infectious aerosol in public spaces, particularly medical settings, deserves close investigation; however, approaches for rapidly parameterizing the temporospatial distribution of particles released by an infected individual have not been reported in literature. This paper presents a methodology for mapping the movement of aerosol plumes using a network of low-cost PM sensors in ICUs. Mimicking aerosol generation by a patient, we tracked aerosolized NaCl particles functioning as tracers for potentially infectious aerosols. In positive (closed door) and neutral-pressure (open door) ICUs, an aerosol spike was detected outside the room, with up to 6% or 19% of all PM escaping through the door gaps, respectively. The outside sensors registered no aerosol spike in negative-pressure ICUs. The K-means clustering analysis of temporospatial data suggests three distinct zones: (1) near the aerosol source, (2) room periphery, and (3) immediately outside the room. These zones inform two-phase aerosol plume behavior: dispersion of the original aerosol spike throughout the room, and evacuation phase where \\"well-mixed\\" PM decayed uniformly. Decay rates were calculated for 4 ICUs in positive, neutral, and negative mode, with negative modes decaying the fastest. This research demonstrates the methodology for aerosol persistence monitoring in medical settings; however, it is limited by a relatively small data set. Future studies need to evaluate medical settings with high risks of infectious disease, assess risks of airborne disease transmission, and optimize hospital infrastructure. Significance StatementAirborne infectious diseases, including COVID-19, are a major concern for patients and hospital staff. Here, we develop a systematic methodology for mapping the temporospatial distribution of aerosols in ICUs using a network of low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors. Our method of analysis provides a perspective on the exfiltration efficiency of ICUs as well as the benefits of rooms that have a negative-pressure mode. Our methods could be extended to other public spaces with a high risk of infectious disease to optimize infrastructure and assess the risk of airborne disease.","output":"Zonal Model of Aerosol Persistence in ICUs: Utilization of Time and Space-resolved Sensor Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer has become a prevalent disease, affecting millions of new patients globally each year.

To examine the distribution of viral antigens within this infected central nervous system (CNS) tissue, we used the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method to detect monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies bound to JHM structural proteins; in addition we used the Western blot technique to detect viral proteins. Our study demonstrated the following characteristics: Infected neuronal and glial cells produced viral nucleocapsid and E2 glycoprotein. The synthesis of these viral structural proteins was not restricted to cells in any particular part of the central nervous system. While JHM E2 proteins could be detected in individual cells of JHM-infected CNS tissue, the relative level of detectable E2 protein in the total CNS tissue of infected rats was reduced by more than 13-fold compared with JHM-infected tissue culture cells. Hippocampus neuronal cells provided a sensitive indication of JHM infection. These cells invariably contained antigens in both acutely and chronically infected animals. The distribution of cells containing viral antigens differed markedly for JHM-induced acute encephalitis and chronic demyelinating disease. Acutely infected brains had large lesions containing low levels of viral antigen scattered throughout the brain. One percent to ten percent of histologically normal cells in many parts of the brain contained viral antigens; in addition, more neuronal cells than glial cells were observed to be antigen-positive.

Here, using a computational framework based on the 2D Zernike formalism we investigate details of the molecular binding and evaluate the changes in ACE2-Spike binding compatibility upon mutations occurring in the ACE2 side of the molecular interface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing our results with experimental binding affinities changes upon ACE2 mutations, separating ones that increase or decrease binding affinity with an Area Under the ROC curve ranging from 0.66 to 0.93, depending on the magnitude of the effects analyzed.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between chronic exposure to air pollution in Israeli cities and towns, their demographic and socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 morbidity, during the three local morbidity waves. METHODS: We examined the associations between: (a) annual average concentrations of NOx, CO, PM(10), PM(2.5) and SO(2) in 2016C2019, and demographic and socioeconomic parameters, and (b) COVID-19 positive cases in 279 Israeli cities and towns, in the four state-wide morbidity peaks: 1(st) wave peak: March 31(st), 2020; 2(nd) wave peaks: July 24(th) and September 27(th), 2020, and the 3(rd) wave peak: January 17(th), 2021, which occurred after the beginning of the nationwide vaccination campaign. These associations were calculated using both Spearman correlations and multivariate linear regressions. RESULTS: We found statistically significant positive correlations between the concentrations of most pollutants in 2016C19 and COVID-19 morbidity rate at the first three timepoints but not the 4t(h) (January 17(th), 2021). Population density and city/town total population were also positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates at these three timepoints, but not the 4(th), in which socioeconomic parameters were more dominant - we found a statistically significant negative correlation between socioeconomic cluster and COVID-19 morbidity. In addition, all multivariate models including PM(2.5) concentrations were statistically significant, and PM(2.5) concentrations were positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates in all models. CONCLUSIONS: We found a nationwide association between population chronic exposure to five main air pollutants in Israeli cities and towns, and COVID-19 morbidity rates during two of the three morbidity waves experienced in Israel. The widespread morbidity that was related to socioeconomic factors during the 3(rd) wave, emphasizes the need for special attention to morbidity prevention in socioeconomically vulnerable populations and especially in large household communities. Nevertheless, this ecological study has several limitations, such as the inability to draw conclusions about causality or mechanisms of action. The growing body of evidence, regarding association between exacerbated COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates and long-term chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of air pollutants should serve as a wake-up call to policy makers regarding the urgent need to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects.","output":"Effects of chronic exposure to ambient air pollutants, demographic, and socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 morbidity: The Israeli case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a substantial threat to the health of health care personnel on the front line of caring for patients with COVID-19.

Few studies have analysed how self-care behaviours have changed during COVID-19 and the role of digital technology, especially amongst people with chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review how self-care behaviours have changed for people with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what technology they have adopted to manage their conditions during that period. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using narrative synthesis. Data were extracted from PubMed, MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Google Scholar, including articles from December 2019 onwards. Eligible studies focused on adults diagnosed with chronic conditions undertaking any self-care tasks in line with the middle range theory of self-care of chronic illness (i.e. self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management). Methodological quality of included articles was assessed with the McMaster Critical Review Forms for Quantitative or Qualitative studies. RESULTS: In total, 36 primary research articles were included. Changes to self-care behaviours during COVID-19 amongst people with chronic conditions were organised according to the middle range theory of self-care of chronic illness focusing on self-care maintenance (i.e. medication adherence, physical activity, diet control), self-care monitoring (i.e. monitoring signs and symptoms), and self-care management (i.e. consultations with health careproviders). Positive self-care behaviours observed include: individuals trying to maintain good glycaemic control during COVID-19 increased their medication adherence in 27% of studies; and diet control improved in 50% of studies. Negative self-care behaviours observed include: decline in physical activities and increased sedentariness observed in 65% of studies; poor diet control in 57% of studies, and self-monitoring of health status dropped in 43% of studies. Use of technology to support self-care of chronic conditions during COVID-19 was reported in 26 studies. The actual utilisation of telehealth in place of physical consultations during COVID-19 was observed in 50% of studies and other digital technologies (e.g. social media apps, smart phone apps, online platforms, web browsing) were used in 50% of studies. Telehealth was discussed and recommended as the default technology in delivering future health care services during COVID-19 and beyond in 77% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted the necessity to re-think how models of self-care should continue to address the demands of chronic conditions while being responsive to the imminent threats of infectious diseases. Perhaps the silver lining of COVID-19 is that adoption of digital technology (especially telehealth) amongst a vast cross-section of people with chronic conditions is possible. Future research should investigate effective ways to incorporate evidence-based digital health tools into these new models of self-care that address the challenges of chronic and infectious conditions.","output":"Self-care Behaviours and Technology utilised during COVID-19: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic management of concurrent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in patients with a pre-existing myasthenia gravis (MG) METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with preexisting MG presenting with concurrent COVID-19 between September 21st and November 4th, 2020 when attending the emergency department or routine neurology consultation at the National Institute Mongi Ben Hamida of Neurology of Tunis, Tunisia RESULTS: Five patients were identified The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America scores (MGFA) prior to COVID-19 infection were class I in one patient, class II (IIa, IIb) in two patients, and class IIIb in one patient Four patients had mild to moderate courses of COVID-19 infection One patient presented a critical infection with acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation Two of them also demonstrated signs of MG exacerbation requiring the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in one case We maintained immunosuppressant therapy to MG in all our patients All our patients received Azithromycin (AZM) as a part of specific drug treatment of COVID-19 infection Outcome was favorable in 4 patients and rapidly fatal evolution was observed in the patient with ADRS DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION: The results from our study suggest that prior MG activity could partially influence the subsequent clinical outcomes It emerged also that ongoing long-term immunosuppressive immunotherapy to MG should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic and that AZM can be used safely in MG patients and concurrent COVID-19 infection","output":"Myasthenia gravis and COVID-19: A case series and comparison with literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spermatogenesis is a complex and elaborate differentiation process and is vital for male fertility.

The PCR includes multiple reaction stages (denaturation, annealing, and extension), and a complicated thermalcycler is required to repetitively provide different temperatures for different stages for 30-40 cycles within at least 1-2 hours. Due to the complicated devices and the long amplification time, it is difficult to adopt conventional PCR in point-of-care testing (POCT). Comparing to conventional PCR, isothermal amplification is able to provide a much faster and more convenient nucleic acid detection because of highly efficient amplification at a constant reaction temperature provided by a simple heating device. When isothermal amplification is combined with microfluidics, a more competent platform for POCT can be established. For example, various diagnosis devices based on isothermal amplification have been used to rapidly and conveniently detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This review summarized the recent development and applications of the microfluidics-based isothermal amplification. First, different typical isothermal amplification methods and related detection methods have been introduced. Subsequently, different types of microfluidic systems with isothermal amplification were discussed based on their characteristics, for example, functionality, system structure, flow control, and operation principles. Furthermore, detection of pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 viruses) based on isothermal amplification was introduced.

Evidence Review: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and TdP, the CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was searched. Based on the information collected, the authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to find the clinical outcomes of drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics Results: The main interaction between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT prolongation and TdP, and CYP interactions. Remdesivir, favipiravir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics with no risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics, although it can restore the activity of CYP3A4 and therefore its substrate metabolism may increase. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for co-administration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin (all prolong QT interval) and lopinavir / ritonavir (CYP interaction and risk of QT prolongation).

METHODS: Using interviews, field deployment, and fixed logging tasks, we assessed the developed devices. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that the tangible devices provided data comparable with standardized psychological scales of emotion. The participants developed their own patterns of use around the devices, and their experience of using the devices uncovered a variety of design considerations. We discuss the difficulty of customizing devices for specific user needs while logging data comparable to psychological scales of emotion.

One hundered and seven complete sequences and 1022 S1-region sequences of Chinese IBVs isolated between 1994 and 2014 were analysed by using MEGA 5.0 software and the Bayesian analysis sampling trees (BEAST) method, and selection pressure on different proteins was assessed. The phylogenetic dissimilarity of different gene trees in the data set indicated possible recombination. Fourteen isolates were identified as recombinants, possibly generated from vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype in recombination with circulating viruses. The earliest IBV in China was found to have existed in the early 1900s, and continues to evolve at a rate of approximately 10(?) (5) substitutions per site per year. We found that purifying selection was the main evolutionary pressure in the protein-coding regions, while the S1 gene bears the greatest positive selection pressure. The proportion of QX-like genotype strains increased over time.

Proteomics provides a critical data source for such models, but currently lacks robust de novo methods for network construction, which could bring important insights in systems biology. RESULTS: We have evaluated the construction of network models using methods derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We show that approximately scale-free peptide networks, composed of statistically significant modules, are feasible and biologically meaningful using two mouse lung experiments and one human plasma experiment. Within each network, peptides derived from the same protein are shown to have a statistically higher topological overlap and concordance in abundance, which is potentially important for inferring protein abundance. The module representatives, called eigenpeptides, correlate significantly with biological phenotypes. Furthermore, within modules, we find significant enrichment for biological function and known interactions (gene ontology and protein-protein interactions). CONCLUSIONS: Biological networks are important tools in the analysis of complex systems. In this paper we evaluate the application of weighted co-expression network analysis to quantitative proteomics data. Protein co-expression networks allow novel approaches for biological interpretation, quality control, inference of protein abundance, a framework for potentially resolving degenerate peptide-protein mappings, and a biomarker signature discovery.","output":"Protein co-expression network analysis (ProCoNA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 lockdown was a set of nationwide public health restrictions in force on the UK from March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

We carried out in-depth interviews with 31 autistic adults exploring their experiences of the COVID-19 lockdown and how the pandemic may affect future research participation. Transcripts were analysed thematically within a critical realism framework. Participants identified positive aspects of lockdown such as enjoying the lack of social pressures and using their well-developed skills for dealing with uncertainty. Autistic people also shared challenges of adjusting to lockdown, e.g., rapid change in daily routines. While hopeful about the freedom gained from easing restrictions, participants were concerned about the inconsistent communication and application of rules during the transition out of lockdown which may exacerbate already rising mental health issues among autistic people.

We show here that in transfected cells, the ORF3a protein of SARS CoV-1 disrupts Golgi morphology, cargo trafficking and luminal pH.

Participants also favored admitting a heart attack patient rather than a COVID-19 patient with the same likelihood of benefiting from ICU admission, indicating a preference for maintaining regular ICU services rather than treating those with severe COVID-19. Finally, participants were more likely to admit a patient to intensive care when this meant withholding rather than withdrawing care from another patient. The results indicate that lay prioritizations violate established allocation principles, presaging potential conflicts between those in need of intensive care and those who provide and allocate it. It is therefore recommended that allocation principles should be explained to enhance public understanding. Additionally, vaccination rates should be increased to relieve ICUs and reduce the need for such triage decisions.","output":"A lay perspective on prioritization for intensive care in pandemic times: Vaccination status matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented global healthcare crisis.

In this study, we report on immune responses to 3rd- (V3) and 4th- (V4) doses of heterologous and homologous vaccines in a kidney transplant population. Methods 724 kidney transplant recipients were prospectively screened for serological responses following 3 primary doses of a SARS-CoV2 vaccine. 322 patients were sampled post-V4 for anti-spike (anti-S), with 69 undergoing assessment of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses. All vaccine doses were received post-transplant, only mRNA vaccines were used for V3 and V4 dosing. All participants had serological testing performed post-V2 and at least once prior to their 1st dose of vaccine. Results 586/724 (80.9%) patients were infection-naive post-V3; 141/2586 (24.1%) remained seronegative at 31 (21-51) days post-V3. Timing of vaccination in relation to transplantation, OR: 0.28 (0.15-0.54), p=0.0001; immunosuppression burden, OR: 0.22 (0.13-0.37), p<0.0001, and a diagnosis of diabetes, OR: 0.49 (0.32-0.75), p=0.001, remained independent risk factors for non-seroconversion. Seropositive patients post-V3 had greater anti-S if primed with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, p=0.001. Post-V4, 45/239 (18.8%) infection-naive patients remained seronegative. De novo seroconversion post-V4 occurred in 15/60 (25.0%) patients who were seronegative post-V3. There was no difference in anti-S post-V4 by vaccine combination, p=0.50. Anti-S post-V4 were sequentially greater in those seroconverting post V2- compared with V3- , and V3- compared with V4-, at 1561 (567-5211), 379 (101-851) and 19 (9.7-48) BAU/ml respectively.

Methods:Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. Data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results: The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18-29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n=1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic.

A mixed methods design was used with quantitative and qualitative data from a cross-sectional survey sent to all members of the Dutch Rheumatology Society in May 2020. The survey contained questions on demographics, the current way of care delivery, and also on usage, acceptance, facilitators and barriers of telemedicine. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. The answers to the open questions were categorized into themes. Seventy-five respondents completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, continuity of care was guaranteed through telephone and video consultations by 99% and 9% of the respondents, respectively. More than 80% of the total number of outpatient visits were performed exclusively via telephone with in-person visits only on indication. One-quarter of the respondents used patient reported outcomes to guide telephone consultations. The top three facilitators for telemedicine were less travel time for patients, ease of use of the system and shorter waiting period for patients. The top three barriers were impossibility to perform physical examination, difficulty estimating how the patient is doing and difficulty in reaching patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, care for patients with RMDs in the Netherlands continued uninterrupted by the aid of telemedicine. On average, respondents were content with current solutions, although some felt insecure mainly because of the inability to perform physical examination and missing nonverbal communication with their patients.","output":"Telemedicine for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic; a positive experience in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is flooding and splitting efficiency fault lines in todays industrialized food system.

In 1619, an English ship landed on the shores of the Powhatan confederacy, or, as the English called it, Point Comfort, Virginia. The ship delivered stolen people onto stolen land. This was a first step in founding todays U.S. food system. Until that time, the people of North America and West Africa had lived off the land for millennia, foraging, hunting, and cultivating food. But 400 years ago, the twin European colonial influences of invasion and enslavement entwined the lives and, to some extent, the foodways of Native Americans and West Africans in what is now the U.S. Yet, these communities are still resilient.

Several previous studies made use of wearable devices to detect medication behaviors of patients. However, the wearable devices cause inconvenience while equipping the devices. In addition, they suffer from inconsistency problems due to errors of measured values. We devise a medication behavior monitoring system that uses the IoT and deep learning to avoid sensing errors and improve user experiences by effectively detecting various activities of patients. Based on the real-time operation of our proposed IoT device, the proposed solution processes captured images of patents via OpenPose to check medication situations. The proposed system identifies medication status on time by using a human activity recognition scheme and provides various notifications to patients' mobile devices. To support reliable communication between our system and doctors, we employ MQTT protocol with periodic data transmissions. Thus, the measured information of patient's medication status is transmitted to the doctors so that they can periodically perform remote treatments. Experimental results show that all medication behaviors are accurately detected and notified to the doctor efficiently, improving the accuracy of monitoring the patient's medication behavior.","output":"A deep learning-based medication behavior monitoring system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 35-year-old gravida 3, para 0 woman required an emergency caesarean section for pre-eclampsia with severe features including a platelet count of 7  109.l-1.

Sustainable Tourism Indicators (STI:2004) show that sustainable tourism development promotes economic, social, environmental, and cultural sustainability. Therefore, it is essential to understand the resident situational context and safeguard the happiness in the society that hosts tourism. Tourism that uses cultural heritage as a selling point includes ethnic tourism. Cultural heritage and traditional values are attractive sales resources for generating tourism revenue. This point may be detrimental to the residents because they damage the culture and traditions in multiple economic, social, and cultural aspects of economic, social, and cultural. Ethnic tourism must be sustainable without destroying the local culture and traditions. This study aims to analyze whether the requirements for sustainable tourism development that the UNWTO outlined met by the ethnic tourism that Bali develop. Ethnic tourism has grown in Bali since it first began in the 1970s; many tourists have visited the region and have been deeply impressed by its traditional arts and crafts and hope to bring them back. This phenomenon has generated an immense demand for taking home back pieces of traditional Balinese art and crafts and bolster the mass production of traditional art and crafts sold as souvenirs to tourists. Regarding this situation, positive and negative effects on the culture and traditions of the region by over-tourism through ethnic tourism need to be determined. This study focused on traditional Balinese sculptures and paintings and conducted surveys to examine the consciousness of craftsmen involved in traditional crafts to reveal the influences of tourism on traditional culture in Bali. The hypothesis of this study was as follows: Ethnic tourism that attempts to sell traditional culture to the tourist does not satisfy the requirements for the development of sustainable tourism development leading to happiness in the society hosting the tourism. As a preliminary survey, I planned interviews to obtain the craftsmen's opinions and to devise questions for subsequent questionnaires. I conducted the interviews with craftsmen in August 2019 (n = 4). Subsequently, I conducted the questionnaire survey for craftsmen (wood-carving and painting) in August and September 2019 and January 2020 (n = 103). The questionnaires were analyzed using simple tabulation, comparison of means, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis. Additionally, as a survey to understand customers needs concerning traditional culture, I conducted an interview survey for tourists in August 2019. This survey sought to identify why they purchased wood-carvings and paintings (n = 9). These surveys showed that nearly half of the craftsmen involved in traditional crafts lost their employment because of ethnic tourism. The hypothesis was verified because the situation did not achieve sustainability for maintaining the livelihoods of the craftsmen, who also play a role in the transmission of traditional culture. It was unclear whether the life with ethnic tourism that eliminated their position would lead to happiness.","output":"Is meeting the needs of tourists through ethnic tourism sustainable?

Therefore, there are concerns about treatment approaches in rehabilitation for long COVID patients. Up to date, Long COVID patients present fatigue and respiratory symptoms predominantly. The hypothesis presented in this paper is that the treatment approach for Long COVID patients may depend on the aetiology of their symptoms, which objective tests can assess. And the primary affected system in a given patient may determine the individual response to physical exhaustion. Then, we propose an assessment to confirm the system impaired under the predominant symptom to guide the rehabilitation intervention. Fatigue-related symptoms, PEM, physical deconditioning and response to exertion should be assessed in Long COVID patients with predominant fatigue. In contrast, the respiratory function by spirometry and the diffusion capacity should be objectively assessed in those patients with predominantly respiratory symptoms. Future research should develop and validate patient-reported outcomes or cardiopulmonary exercise testing to objectively assess the symptoms and functional status in Long COVID patients to reinforce the proposed assessment.","output":"Proposal for assessment of the predominant symptom and physical function in patients suffering from Long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To estimate the incidence of in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in COVID 19 patients, as well as to compare the incidence and outcomes of IHCA in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus non ICU patients with COVID 19.

Nitrate ingestion has also been shown to reduce blood pressure in some, but not all, studies of older individuals. However, the optimal dose for eliciting these beneficial effects is unknown. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed to determine the effects of ingesting 3.3 mL/kg of concentrated beetroot juice (BRJ) containing 0, 200, or 400 umol/kg of nitrate in nine healthy older subjects (one man, eight women; mean age 70+/-1 y). Maximal knee extensor power (Pmax) and speed (Vmax) were measured 2 h after BRJ ingestion using isokinetic dynamometry. Blood pressure was monitored periodically throughout each study. Results: Pmax (in W/kg) was higher (P<0.05) after the low dose (3.9+/-0.4) compared to the placebo (3.7+/-0.4) or high dose (3.7+/-0.4). Vmax (in rad/s) also tended higher (P=0.08) in the low (11.9+/-0.7) compared to the placebo (10.8+/-0.8) or high dose (11.20+/-.8) trials. Eight out of nine subjects achieved a higher Pmax and Vmax after the lower vs. the higher dose. These dose-related changes in muscle contractility paralleled changes in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, as reflected by changes in breath NO and plasma 3 nitrotyrosine levels. No significant changes were found in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure. Conclusions: Varying doses of dietary nitrate have differential effects on muscle function and blood pressure in older individuals. A moderate dose of nitrate increases muscle speed and power, but these improvements are lost at a higher dose.

As hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness continue to increase, many recent reports indicate the supply of PPE is persistently and significantly less than the demand. These PPE shortages encouraged communities of 3D printing experts and hobbyists to design and distribute homemade, 3D-printed PPE, including N95 mask substitutes. The mask presented, the Kansas City Mask (KC Mask), is one such product which was created from the maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This report discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the KC Mask design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods: The KC Mask was adapted from a similar design called the Montana Mask. Mask components were 3D printed and assembled then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, MO as a proof of concept. Results: The QLFT was successful and the KC Mask was approved for use by pandemic response administration staff at the hospital. Fortunately, the KC Mask has not required wide utilization, however, because supply chains for Kansas City area hospitals have, at the time of this publication, not yet been exhausted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The results of Truman Medical Center approval of the KC Mask are promising for this N95 stop-gap substitute. Although further analysis and study is needed for this design, persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitate an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for the KC Mask as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse the KC Mask as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage based on CDC guidelines.","output":"3D Printed N95 Equivalent for PPE Shortages: The Kansas City Mask"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spring semester, 2020, ANSC 412: Swine Production and Management (4 credits, lecture and laboratory) was offered in the Department of Animal Science at Texas A&M University following a period of nonappearance in the curriculum. Simultaneously, planned renovation of the campus swine teaching farm required depopulation of the existing herd. Hence, animal access for course laboratories was restricted for the 2020 spring and fall semesters. The objective is to present strategies to achieve effective laboratory learning objectives with limited livestock access. Average course enrollment in 2020 spring and fall semesters was 11 students of junior and senior standing. The course laboratory was held for two hours weekly for fifteen weeks. COVID-19 interruption of the spring semester, and arrival of pigs to the campus swine teaching farm in the fall semester, necessitated creation of ten equivalent laboratory sessions per semester. Example laboratory sessions include: panels with swine industry professionals, Pork Quality Assurance version 4.0 certification, virtual farm tours, evaluating genetic merit with National Swine Registry Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System EPD data and indexes, understanding leastcost diet formulation with diet formulation software, creating and implementing a Secure Pork Supply enhanced biosecurity plan for the campus swine farm, and multiple case study models of troubleshooting reproductive deficiencies with the US Pork Center of Excellence National Swine Reproduction Guide. Laboratory session execution facilitated achievement of TAMU Department of Animal Science programmatic learning outcomes, specifically: understanding animal breeding programs, animal husbandry, reproductive management, and nutrient conversion, and assessing business models and application of animal management strategies. In future semesters with unrestricted swine access for teaching, live-animal handling will be emphasized in the syllabus, yet preservation of effective classroom-based laboratories will persist.

CONCLUSIONS Although the incidence and prevalence of acquired onychoheterotopia are unknown, it seems to be an uncommon phenomenon. From our case and others from the literature, there may be associations with crush injury specifically. Further research will be needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology and risk factors for ectopic nail growth.","output":"Posttraumatic onychoheterotopia: A case and review of the pediatric literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Ciliated foregut cysts (CFC) are rare anomalies due to aberrant embryological development. It is thought to arise from a remnant of the embryologic foregut. The solitary cysts are characterised by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. They are usually located above the diaphragm but they can also arise in relation to the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the first ciliated foregut cyst of the gallbladder case reported in Australia, and the ninth known case to be reported worldwide. A 61-year-old male with chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram. Intraoperatively, 'out-pouching' was noted on the lateral border of the gallbladder. Microscopically the histopathology showed that the cyst was lined by ciliated columnar epithelium the characteristic feature of a ciliated foregut cyst. DISCUSSION To date only 8 cases of these ciliated foregut cysts in the gallbladder have been reported in literature. Our case is the first reported in Australia. It is unique in that the patient was an older male as opposed to most other previous cases, which were younger females. These cysts can be difficult to distinguish from neoplasms clinically and radiographically. Reports have shown that these cysts may become dysplastic and is best excised when discovered. CONCLUSION Despite the rarity of CFCs and their potential to mimic malignancy, we propose awareness and understanding of the management for them-being excision and hopefully not cause any confusion or devastatingly allow it to become malignant.","output":"A rare gallbladder ciliated foregut cyst in chronic cholecystitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses the question, Will post-pandemic travel behaviour, when the virus has gone, be different to pre-pandemic travel?. It adopts an online survey where respondents were asked to report changes in travel during the various stages of the pandemic and expectations of future travel after the virus has gone. The paper focusses on commuting including total commuting, work from home (WFH), employment, travel mode volume and share and timing of morning commute trips using reported behaviour during pandemic shutdowns;and expectations of commuting when the virus has gone. The paper provides evidence that travel behaviour post-pandemic might be different to pre-pandemic travel. It suggests that after the pandemic, public transport ridership, which declined steeply during the pandemic, will return but not to pre-pandemic levels. A post-pandemic reduction effect of around 20% in transit commuting is expected. This effect is supported using secondary evidence from a number of international cities. Results imply a mode shift from public transport use to car driving;this will be particularly large for CBD/downtown areas and is likely to result in peak period traffic congestion after the virus has gone. Work from home increased substantially during the pandemic;this will reduce after the pandemic as enforced WFH is replaced by voluntary WFH. Nevertheless, a sustained future ongoing increase in WFH above pre-pandemic levels is suggested, acting to reduce peak commuting by 6% and commuting to Melbourne CBD by 20%. However, reductions in commuting due to WFH do not offset mode shift from public transport to car driving resulting in a net increase in car use after the pandemic. Infection fear is a new top concern of public transport users since the pandemic. This fear has transitioned from fresh infection fear;the initial concerns when the pandemic started to residual infection fear;a long-term effect when the virus has gone. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.","output":"Evidence of a post-COVID change in travel behaviour C Self-reported expectations of commuting in Melbourne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this communication essay, I respond to the three questions the journal editor Wei-Ning Xiang asked about my experiences in, and reflections on, the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic in China.

Aim We evaluated differences in the rate of first-time opioid fills at doses  50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day and first-time opioid fills with benzodiazepine fill overlap following the CDC guidelines and following a PCC between provider types, geographic locations, and insurance types. Method We used OptumLabs? Data Warehouse claims data between 2014 and 2018. Subjects were opioid na?ve non-cancer care patients, 18 years and older who had an identified chronic pain condition ICD diagnosis within 2 weeks prior to their first-time opioid fill. We used multiple treatment period segmented regression analysis with interaction terms to test the differences between primary care providers (PCPs) and specialist providers (SPs), urban and rural primary care service areas (PCSAs), and Medicare Advantage (MA) and commercially insured patients (CIPs) in their first-time opioid fill patterns. Results Prescribing first-time opioid fills at doses  50MME/day declined following the CDC guidelines and PCC, the decline was greater among SPs than PCPs and in rural PCSAs than urban PCSAs. Also, following the CDC guidelines, the decline was greater among MA patients however following the PCC the decline was greater among CIPs. There were no differences in rate of first-time opioid fill with benzodiazepine overlap between groups. Conclusion Responses to the CDC opioid guidelines and a PCC differed between PCPs and SPs, urban and rural PCSAs, and when prescribing to MA and CIPs.

When the force generated by cyclic interactions between myosin crossbridges and actin filaments is greater than the average load shared by the crossbridges, sliding of the actin filaments occurs and the muscle shortens. The shortening velocity as a function of muscle load can be described mathematically by a hyperbola; this characteristic forceCvelocity relationship stems from stochastic interactions between the crossbridges and the actin filaments. Beyond the actomyosin interaction, there is not yet a unified theory explaining smooth muscle contraction, mainly because the structure of the contractile unit in smooth muscle (akin to the sarcomere in striated muscle) is still undefined. In this review, functional and structural data from airway smooth muscle are analyzed in an engineering approach of quantification and correlation to support a model of the contractile unit with characteristics revealed by mathematical analyses and behavior matched by experimental observation.","output":"Myosin Crossbridge, Contractile Unit, and the Mechanism of Contraction in Airway Smooth Muscle: A Mechanical Engineer's Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet.

Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2-infected bloodmeal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth & Jones) (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2-spiked blood and at a time point postinfection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae) (C6/36), Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

We also investigated the effect of social distance policies on the level of economic activities and on the prices of stock indexes. Data were collected from stock exchanges on four continents: North America, Africa, Asia and Europe. We extracted information from the stock market on the closing price (PF), lowest price (PB) and highest price (PMA) of the main stock market indicators on the four continents: the FTSE 500 index (United Kingdom);SP 500 (USA);Nikkei 225 (Japan);and the SA Top 40 index (South Africa). In the estimates, we adopted the natural logarithm of each price data to reduce the asymmetry observed in the distribution of stock price data. We concentrated the analysis in the period from January to May 2020, when the coronavirus started to spread to other countries and international markets. We empirically examine the impact of social distance policies on economic activities and stock market indices. The findings reveal that the increasing number of blocking days, monetary policy decisions and international travel restrictions have severely affected the level of economic activities and the closing, opening, lower and higher share prices of the main stock indexes. On the other hand, the restriction imposed on the domestic movement and the increase in spending on fiscal policies had a positive impact on the level of economic activities, although the growing number of confirmed cases of coronavirus virus did not significantly affect the level of economic activities.

This study characterizes the epidemiology of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan between 2003 and 2006. METHODS Using Taiwan's 2003-2006 national health insurance claims, we investigated the epidemiologic features of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9-CM code 446.1) and coronary artery aneurysm formation (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 414.11) and compared the incidences of these diseases with those occurring between 1996 and 2002 in Taiwan and those reported by other countries. RESULTS During our 4-year study period, 3877 children and adolescents <20 years of age were hospitalized for Kawasaki disease. Ninety percent of these children were <5 years of age, and the male/female ratio was 1.62:1. The annual incidence of Kawasaki disease was 153 in 100000 children <1 year of age, 111 in children 1 year of age, 58 in children 2 years of age, 30 in children 3 years of age, 19 in children 4 years of age, and 5.2 in children 5 to 9 years of age. The overall incidence was 69 cases per 100000 for children <5 years of age. Kawasaki disease recurred in 1.5% of all cases. Kawasaki disease occurred most frequently in the summer and least frequently in the winter. Coronary artery aneurysm occurred in 7.2% (279 of 3877) of all Kawasaki disease cases. CONCLUSIONS The overall incidence of Kawasaki disease was 69 in 100000 children <5 years of age between 2003 and 2006 in Taiwan, comparable with the incidence of 66 in 100000 children between 1996 and 2002.

Trust, important in all patientCprovider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury. OBJECTIVES: In this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Within the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng. RESULTS: CHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses insensitive behaviour, the CHWs attempts to repair patients institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system. CONCLUSION: Strategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.","output":"Community health workers efforts to build health system trust in marginalised communities: a qualitative study from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A universal influenza candidate vaccine that targets multiple conserved influenza virus epitopes from hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M2e) proteins was combined with the potent Army liposomal adjuvant (ALFQ) to promote induction of broad immunity to seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.

Mobile health (m-health) apps, one form of digital technology, are increasingly being used to promote positive health related behavior change. Therefore, it is important to conduct research to understand the efficacy of m-health apps. The process of participant recruitment is an essential component in producing strong research evidence, along with ensuring an adequately powered sample to conduct meaningful analyses and draw robust conclusions. Methods: In this work we outline and reflect on the strategies used to recruit help-seeking military veterans into an intervention study, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an app (Drinks:Ration) to modify behavior in alcohol misusers. Recruitment strategies included through (1) partner organizations and (2) social media and Facebook advertising (ads). Results: Facebook ads were live for a period of 88 days and were viewed by a total audience of 29,416 people. In total 168 military veterans were recruited across all recruitment strategies, meaning that Drinks:Ration exceeded its recruitment targets. Half of the sample (n = 84) were recruited through social media, including Facebook ads. Conclusions: The current article highlighted that targeted Facebook ads were an efficient strategy to recruit military veterans into a digital intervention trial aiming to reduce alcohol consumption because they reduced the amount of time and resources required to contact a large number of potentially eligible individuals for our study.

Depending on the country of origin, poorer pregnancy and birth outcomes amongst migrant women have been reported. Providing appropriate culturally sensitive perinatal services is of paramount importance. METHODS: The Operational Refugee And Migrant Mothers Approach (ORAMMA) was a three-site multidisciplinary collaborative research project, designed to develop and test implementation of a high-quality maternity care model including peer supporters for migrant women who have recently arrived in European countries. Community-based activities were undertaken to ensure ongoing local impact for maintaining supportive interactions amongst peer supporters and recently arrived migrant women in the UK. RESULTS: The women who volunteered to become maternity peer supporters were motivated by their own experiences of being newly arrived migrants in the past or a sense of altruism. Forging links with multiple local community groups enabled the continuation of the support provided by maternity peer supporters, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of maternity peer supporters in supporting newly arrived mothers has multiple advantages of addressing social isolation and marginalisation of migrant communities, with potential benefits of improving access and enhancing health literacy and health outcomes amongst recently arrived migrant women as well as creating a self-supporting network for peer supporters themselves.","output":"Improving pregnancy and birth experiences of migrant mothers: A report from ORAMMA and continued local impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and community prevention has become the most essential part in reducing the spread risk and protecting populations.

The body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), MD adherence, PA, ST and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were evaluated. The association of AO and anthropometric variables with lifestyle was estimated through multiple linear regression. To determine the association between AO and lifestyle, a logistic regression and the inclusion of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. RESULTS: Worse CRF in Chilean children were positively correlated with WC. Excess weight in Chilean and Colombian children was positively associated with an unhealthy lifestyle. In Chilean children unhealthy lifestyle was also associated with AO based on WC85th percentile and AO based on WtHR85th percentile. In Chilean children, excess weight (BMI85th percentile) was positively associated with poor MD adherence.

Heart disease is known to be one of the deadliest diseases which is hampering the lives of many people around the world. Heart disease must be detected early so the loss of lives can be prevented. The availability of large-scale data for medical diagnosis has helped developed complex machine learning and deep learning-based models for automated early diagnosis of heart diseases. The classical approaches have been limited in terms of not generalizing well to new data which have not been seen in the training set. This is indicated by a large gap in training and test accuracies. This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture using a 1D convolutional neural network for classification between healthy and non-healthy persons to overcome the limitations of classical approaches. Various clinical parameters are used for assessing the risk profile in the patients which helps in early diagnosis. Various techniques are used to avoid overfitting in the proposed network.

In addition, the fresh air energy consumption of different ventilation modes was compared to help residents save energy. In summer, a window-opening ratio of 25% (0.3 m2) could effectively improve IAQ. However, it is not recommended to use natural ventilation in winter because the outdoor PM2.5 concentration is too high. Moreover, the fresh air energy consumption for the automatic control window-opening ratio was 1/5 of that for a window-opening ratio of 25%. In the whole summer, it can save 196.1 kWh compared to a fixed window-opening ratio of 25%. Fresh air systems could greatly improve IAQ and lower energy consumption regardless of the season.

In all three countries, the leaders' responses to the outbreak can be characterised by the following features: simplifying the pandemic by downplaying its impacts or touting easy solutions or treatments, spectacularizing their responses to crisis, forging divisions between the 'people' and dangerous 'others', and making medical knowledge claims to support the above.

To do so, for each independent area of Pakistan, the observed mortality due to COVID-19 has been standardized over the entire population using standard age groups ranging from 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14,, 65, and above years, supported by the 2017 state people census. The impact of air pollution and COVID-19 transience among Pakistani areas, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), and the Federally Administered Tribal Region (FATA) was analyzed by a multiple-linear regression model, while the broad collection of attributes was observed by the resources of local spatial autocorrelation indicators, including the spatial portion of COVID-19 association. The result indicates that the observed mortality rate is much higher than predicted in certain provinces, namely, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces, and the prevalence of PM(10) was independently linked to mortality due to the corona virus. Additionally, the results of the local spatial autocorrelation indicators on the standardized mortality rate and PM(10) define a collection of very higher ideologies in the broad range of KPK and the southern part of Punjab province, respectively, with a definite degree of connection between the two distributions in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. In brief, this research seems to find a justification for confirming the existence of a correlation between the possibility of COVID-19 mortality and air pollution, more precisely considering air pollutants (i.e., particulate (PM(10)) and land take-over.

Simultaneously, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in mobile health apps. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations. METHODS: We first studied the users needs and gathered users graphical preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150 design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics, diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to test feasibility. RESULTS: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4 specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical activity, social network, user's status score, and project information. We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11%), 5 overweight people (7%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4 kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10 minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting 30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities. CONCLUSIONS: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical activity, BMI, and specific diseases.

Given the rapid deterioration of patients' condition before death, markers with efficient prognostic values are urgently required. During the treatment process, notable changes in plasma potassium levels have been observed among severely ill patients. We aimed to evaluate the association between average plasma potassium (K(a)(+)) levels during hospitalization and 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China from February 8 to 28, 2020 were enrolled in this study. We followed patients up to 30 days after admission. Results: A total of 136 patients were included in the study. The average age was 62.114.6 years and 51.5% of patients were male. The median baseline potassium level was 4.3 (3.9-4.6) mmol/L and K(a)(+) level during hospitalization was 4.4 (4.2-4.7) mmol/L; the median number of times that we measured potassium was 4 (3-5). The 30-day mortality was 19.1%. A J-shaped association was observed between K(a)(+) and 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression showed that compared with the reference group (K(a)(+) 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L), 30-day mortality was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.54-7.35, P=0.300), 1.14 (95% CI=0.39-3.32, P=0.810), and 4.14 (95% CI=1.29-13.29, P=0.017) times higher in patients with COVID-19 who had K(a)(+) <4.0, 4.5 to <5.0, and 5.0 mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 who had a K(a)(+) level 5.0 mmol/L had a significantly increased 30-day mortality compared with those who had a K(a)(+) level 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L.

While our understanding of this novel virus is rapidly increasing, gaps remain in our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress host cell antiviral responses. Recent work on other viruses has demonstrated a novel mechanism through which viral proteins can mimic critical regions of human histone proteins. Histone proteins are responsible for governing genome accessibility and their precise regulation is critical for a cells ability to control transcription and respond to viral threats. Here, we show that the protein encoded by ORF8 (Orf8) in SARS-CoV-2 functions as a histone mimic of two critical histone 3 sites containing an ARKS motif. Orf8 expression in cells disrupts multiple critical histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) while Orf8 lacking this histone mimic motif does not. Orf8 binds to numerous histone-associated proteins and to DNA, and is itself acetylated within the histone mimic site. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection of multiple susceptible cell types causes the same global changes of histone post-translational modifications that are disrupted by Orf8 expression;these include induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2) and cardiomyocytes (iCM) and postmortem patient lung tissue. These findings demonstrate a novel function for the poorly understood SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 encoded protein and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Notably, this work provides a potential mechanism for emerging findings from human patients indicating that ORF8 deletion results in less severe illness and describes a potentially druggable pathway that may contribute to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by ORF8 contains a histone mimic that disrupts chromatin regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19, a major Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management.

To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA.

In this study, we aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the PSQ from its published German and English versions into the Dutch language and to assess validity of the PSQ in healthy volunteers. After translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the PSQ following international guidelines, we validated the PSQ in 394 healthy volunteers by comparing the PSQ-values with two different experimental pain tests: electrical pain tolerance (EPT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). In addition, ratings of pain intensity during these tests were obtained on the numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10). We found that the reliability of the PSQ based on internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha 0.90). PSQ-scores, adjusted for age and sex, were statistically significant and weakly inversely correlated to EPT (PSQ-moderate: rho = -0.24, p=0.007; PSQ-total: rho = -0.22, p=0.016).

While the mediation model of neuroticism, perceived stress and depression have been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether equanimity mediates the relationship of these variables in parallel, serial or moderated mediation models. This study aimed to investigate the role of equanimity among those models. Methods: In all, 644 general participants (74.2% female, mean age = 28.28 (SD = 10.6)) provided data on the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Neuroticism Inventory (NI), depression subscale of the Core Symptom Index, and the equanimity subscale of the inner Strength-based Inventory. Mediation and moderation analyses with the 5000 bootstrapping method were applied. Results: Equanimity was shown to moderate the relationship between NI/PSS and depressive symptom. Statistical evaluation supported all parallel, serial and moderated mediation models. Equanimity as a moderator provided a higher amount of percent variance explained by depressive symptoms than parallel and serial mediation models. Conclusions: Results suggest that the effect of perceived stress and neuroticism on depression can be mitigated by increasing levels of equanimity. The results demonstrated one potential benefit from practicing equanimity; enabling its extension to mental health problems could constitute an interesting focus for future research.","output":"Role of Equanimity on the Mediation Model of Neuroticism, Perceived Stress and Depressive Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe 2019 coronavirus epidemic (CoViD-19) in Italy originated in Lombardy, on February 21, 2020. Crowding has been defined as a worldwide problem as cause of reduced quality of care and patient satisfaction. It is due and identified by three orders of factors: those at the access (input);those related to the patients process (throughput);and those at the exit from the ED (output).ObjectivesWe evaluated all the population who went to ED for intossication and substance abuse. Due to the high level of care needed by these, an excessive duration of LOS (length of Stay) can be counterproductive.MethodsWe evaluated all patients accessing our ED for intossication and substance abuse from February 22 to May 1, 2020 and during the same period of the previous year.ResultsWe enrolled 142 patients. The Crowding input factors are lower in the pandemic period: reduced attenders (41 vs 101) and reduced average waiting times (59 min vs 86 min). The Crowding throughput factors have instead worsened: LOS for both the visit rooms (810 vs 544 min) and the holding area (1205 min vs 947 min). The Crowding output factors also worsened: the percentage of access block is higher during the pandemic (10% vs 5%). The Total Access Block Time is significantly higher in the CoViD period for the holding area (1053 vs 930 min).ConclusionsThe pandemic period presented a worsened crowding for these patients due to the Access Block.","output":"Crowding analysis for patients with intossication and substance abuse during the first pandemic wave of 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) at a lombardy ED"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of respiratory illnesses in children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Although this pathogen was only discovered in 2001, an enormous amount of research has been conducted in order to develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent people from contracting the disease. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the most promising experimental B- and T-cell epitopes of human metapneumovirus for the rational design of HMPV vaccines using vector delivery systems, paying special attention to the conservation of these epitopes among different lineages/genotypes of HMPV. The prospects of the successful development of an epitope-based HMPV vaccine are discussed in the context of recent findings regarding HMPVs ability to modulate host immunity. In particular, we discuss the lack of data on experimental human CD4 T-cell epitopes for HMPV despite the role of CD4 lymphocytes in both the induction of higher neutralizing antibody titers and the establishment of CD8 memory T-cell responses. We conclude that current research should be focused on searching for human CD4 T-cell epitopes of HMPV that can help us to design a safe and cross-protective epitope-based HMPV vaccine.","output":"Prospects of and Barriers to the Development of Epitope-Based Vaccines against Human Metapneumovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is devastating the well-being of college students and society.

However, during testing-time, these algorithms assume no data shift, i.e., $\\\\Pr_\\\\text{train}(X,Y) = \\\\Pr_\\\\text{test}(X,Y)$. Domain adaption methods can be adopted for data shift, yet most of them are designed to only encourage similar feature distribution between source and target data. Conditional shift on classes can still affect such adaption. Fortunately, graph yields graph homophily across different data distributions. In response, we propose Shift-Robust Node Classification (SRNC) to address these limitations. We introduce an unsupervised cluster GNN on target graph to group the similar nodes by graph homophily. An adversarial loss with label information on source graph is used upon clustering objective. Then a shift-robust classifier is optimized on training graph and adversarial samples on target graph, which are generated by cluster GNN. We conduct experiments on both open-set shift and representation-shift, which demonstrates the superior accuracy of SRNC on generalizing to test graph with data shift. SRNC is consistently better than previous SoTA domain adaption algorithm on graph that progressively use model predictions on target graph for training.","output":"Shift-Robust Node Classification via Graph Adversarial Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors. Results: Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Association of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors With Severity or Risk of Death in Patients With Hypertension Hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare workers are at elevated risk for suicide; though it has yet to be studied, this risk may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. News media coverage of high-profile suicide is associated with an increased risk of subsequent suicides. No analysis has yet been published of US media practices for reporting on healthcare worker suicides during the pandemic. Aims: The researchers aimed to evaluate pandemic-era media practices by investigating adherence to best-practice suicide reporting guidelines in coverage of Dr. Lorna Breen's death. Methods: The researchers conducted a content analysis of all unique articles by top outlets reporting Dr. Breen's death between April 26 and 29, 2020, and scored them based on their adherence to the 15 best-practice suicide reporting guidelines. Results: Every media outlet violated an average of at least 5 of 15 suicide guidelines in reporting on Dr. Breen's death; some abided by as few as 2 of 15 recommended guidelines. Seven of 15 guidelines were adhered to by fewer than one third of articles. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, notably easy to include, appeared in only 75% of articles. Limitations: The researchers were limited to reviewing media coverage of one specific instance of COVID-era healthcare worker suicide, making these findings applicable as a prominent case study rather than forming a generalizable claim about suicide reporting during the pandemic or about reporting on healthcare suicides. Conclusion: These violations highlight a range of opportunities to improve suicide prevention in the media, which has a responsibility to ensure reporting does not exacerbate the risk of suicide. Improved adherence to these guidelines could reduce harm for healthcare workers during the pandemic.","output":"Violations of Suicide-Prevention Guidelines in US Media Coverage of Physician's Suicide Death During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current national awakening and acknowledgment that White supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism are responsible for the disproportionate effect of coronavirus disease 2019 and of police brutality on Black or Indigenous people and other people of color, people with disabilities, and sexual and gender minorities have ignited a call to action for public health leaders As public health researchers, we must go beyond merely acknowledging the presence of structural racism and explicitly assess the effect of interconnected systems of oppression on health outcomes Intersectionality is an analytic framework that can be used to describe how people marginalized by structural inequities interact with these oppressive systems but only if implemented in the way it was envisioned by Black and Black lesbian feminists 1,2","output":"(Re)centering Black Feminism Into Intersectionality Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Children and youth with complex care needs (CCNs) and their families experience many care transitions over their lifespan and are consequently vulnerable to the discontinuity or gaps in care that can occur during these transitions.

However, this literature has not yet been systematically examined at a comprehensive level. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the range of programmes that support transitions in care for children and youth with CCNs and their families during two phases of their lifespan: (1) up to the age of 19 years (not including their transition to adult healthcare) and (2) when transitioning from paediatric to adult healthcare.

This review has two objectives: first, to understand which methodologies currently exist to evaluate food packaging waste generation and disposal in school foodservice; and second, to describe the creation of and share a practical standardized instrument to evaluate food packaging waste generation and disposal in school foodservice. A systematic review was conducted using the following search terms: solid waste, school, cafeteria and food packaging, waste, and school. The final review included 24 studies conducted in school environments (kindergarten through twelfth grade or college/university), 16 of which took place in the U.S. Food packaging waste evaluations included objective methods of waste audits, models, and secondary data as well as subjective methods of qualitative observations, questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. Large variation exists in the settings, participants, designs, and methodologies for evaluating school foodservice packaging waste. Lack of standardization was observed even within each methodology (e.g., waste audit).

Also antigenic differences were noted as PI3V C strains had lower antibody levels than PI3V A in serums from cattle receiving MLV PI3V A vaccines. This study further demonstrates there is genetic variability of U.S. PI3V strains and also antigenic variability. In addition, isolates from cattle with BRD signs and receiving MLV vaccines may have heterologous types to the vaccines, and molecular tests should be performed to differentiate field from vaccine strains. Potentially the efficacy of current PI3V A vaccines should be evaluated with other types such a PI3V B and PI3V C.","output":"Genomic and antigenic characterization of bovine parainfluenza-3 viruses in the United States including modified live virus vaccine (MLV) strains and field strains from cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SignificanceWe report the discovery of fundamental roles for the noncanonical inflammasome molecule Caspase-4/11 in promoting pathological inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.

Understanding public reactions is vital for effective risk communication and outbreak control and prevention. The Arab world has diverse cultural, economic, and social structures, so public choices and decisions also vary. To investigate the changes in behavior related to food shopping and handling, precautions measures, and hygiene practices of the public during the pandemic, a web-based survey tool was developed and conducted on 1074 subjects in three Arab countries, Lebanon, Jordan, and Tunisia, using a snowball sampling technique. The results showed a significant reduction in RTE consumption during the pandemic, as shown in the 19.2% and 12.2% rise in the proportion of respondents not ordering hot and cold RTE food delivery, respectively. Compared to pre-COVID-19 times, a substantial increase in behaviors related to hygiene and disinfection practices (22.0% - 32.2%) was observed with a lesser increase (11.2%) in handwashing practices before food preparation. Moreover, public concerns about contracting COVID-19 from food led to almost doubling the number of Tunisians using cleaning agents for washing fresh fruits and vegetables (e.g., soaps, non-food grade chlorine bleach) besides a 16 % and 26.1% increase in use among the Jordanian and Lebanese, respectively. However, a third of the respondents did not follow instructions on labels for the use of chemical products. In conclusion, this study identified culture-specific shortfalls in handwashing and unsafe food handling practices during COVID-19 in the Arab countries and sheds light on the paramount role of coordinated efforts between the local health authorities and the food safety and public health stakeholders in risk communication. To reduce health risks, there need to be rigorous educational campaigns and targeted messages that reach out to the general audience on hand hygiene, the health effects of haphazard use of unsafe chemical compounds on food, and recommendations on following label instructions.","output":"An on-line survey of the behavioral changes in Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia during the COVID-19 pandemic related to food shopping, food handling, and hygienic practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The rate of mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction has declined.

The primary diagnostic tool currently employed is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can have good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Unfortunately, implementation costs and logistical problems with reagents during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have hindered its universal on demand adoption. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent a class of diagnostic that, if sufficiently clinically sensitive, may fill many of the gaps in the current RT-PCR testing regime, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, many serology LFAs have been developed, though none meet the performance requirements necessary for diagnostic use cases, primarily due to the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. However, on the basis of previously reported results from SARS-CoV-1, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 assays may have significantly better clinical sensitivity than serology assays. To date, only a very small number of antigen-detecting LFAs have been developed. Development of a half-strip LFA is a useful first step in the development of any LFA format.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among veterans with COVID-19, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing in the laboratory from March through August 2020, cared for at any Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital with 10 or more patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The follow-up period was through November 2020. Data were analyzed from March to November 2020. Exposures: Receiving treatment for COVID-19 in the ICU during a period of increased COVID-19 ICU load, with load defined as mean number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU during the patient's hospital stay divided by the number of ICU beds at that facility, or increased COVID-19 ICU demand, with demand defined as mean number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU during the patient's stay divided by the maximum number of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality was recorded through 30 days after discharge from the hospital. Results: Among 8516 patients with COVID-19 admitted to 88 VA hospitals, 8014 (94.1%) were men and mean (SD) age was 67.9 (14.2) years. Mortality varied over time, with 218 of 954 patients (22.9%) dying in March, 399 of 1594 patients (25.0%) dying in April, 143 of 920 patients (15.5%) dying in May, 179 of 1314 patients (13.6%) dying in June, 297 of 2373 patients (12.5%) dying in July, and 174 of 1361 (12.8%) patients dying in August (P < .001). Patients with COVID-19 who were treated in the ICU during periods of increased COVID-19 ICU demand had increased risk of mortality compared with patients treated during periods of low COVID-19 ICU demand (ie, demand of &#8804;25%); the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.81-1.22; P = .93) for patients treated when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 25% to 50%, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95-1.48; P = .13) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 50% to 75%, and 1.94 (95% CI, 1.46-2.59; P < .001) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 75% to 100%. No association between COVID-19 ICU demand and mortality was observed for patients with COVID-19 not in the ICU. The association between COVID-19 ICU load and mortality was not consistent over time (ie, early vs late in the pandemic). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that although facilities augmented ICU capacity during the pandemic, strains on critical care capacity were associated with increased COVID-19 ICU mortality.

However, the problem of computational prediction for large pseudoknotted folds remains. Here we develop a domain-based method for predicting complex and large pseudoknotted structures from RNA sequences. The model is based on the observation that large RNAs can be separated into different structural domains. The basic idea is to first identify the domains and then predict the structures for each domain. Assembly of the domain structures gives the full structure. The use of the domain-based approach leads to a reduction of computational time by a factor of about ~N ( 2) for an N-nt sequence.

Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the early precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: An observational study utilizing available public data was conducted on the basis of data collected from December 31, 2019 until the end of April 2020 and then compared with data in January 2021. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries' preparedness and precautionary actions. Results: A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most-applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all the indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain and Italy, respectively. Conclusion: The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries might not benefit from applying these indicators.","output":"Are countries' precautionary actions against COVID-19 effective?

This paper reports on a national online survey that was undertaken as phase 1 of a mixed methods study of key stakeholders of the perceived social and technical requirements of a telehealth wheelchair assessment service for people with complex mobility needs. Key stakeholders included wheelchair users and their families, specialist and non-specialist assessors, technicians, and service managers. Responses (n = 114) indicated perceived shortcomings with current in-person assessment. Telehealth assessment was anticipated to improve service quality, particularly the timeliness of services (52/92, 57%) and prioritisation of the urgency of assessment (71/92, 77%). Preferences were for use of existing software rather than bespoke systems. Training in conducting assessment via telehealth was considered essential by most assessors (29/41, 71%). Internet connectivity was in place for most wheelchair users (43/47, 92%) but was inadequate for 29% (14/49) of assessors (pre-COVID-19). M?ori wheelchair users largely had infrastructure in place for telehealth assessment (10/11, 91%) and held positive expectations of it. Telehealth wheelchair and seating assessment is anticipated to improve the quality of care for wheelchair users with complex needs. Upgraded technical capability of public health services and robust training in conducting assessment via telehealth will be critical to successful uptake of this service.

Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. Interventions Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death. Results Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, -2.0% to 8.0%]; P = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.13 to -0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -9.9 to -2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group.

A pandemic is a unique disaster, because the majority of its direct impacts are workforce related and it does not create significant direct impact to infrastructure. In light of this factor, this paper first develops a method of translating unavailable workforce into a measure of economic-sector inoperability. While previous formulations of the DIIM only allowed for the specification of an initial perturbation, this paper incorporates the fact that a pandemic can cause direct effects to the workforce over the recovery period. Given the uncertainty associated with the impact of a pandemic, this paper develops a simulation framework to account for the possible variations in realizations of the pandemic.

The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized studies of interventions were used to assess risk of bias of included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harms extension was used to assess for quality of harms reporting. RESULTS: Sixteen trials including fourteen randomized and two non-randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. The results from included trials were conflicting, lacked effect estimates adjusted for confounders and baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harms data in clinical trials. None of the sixteen trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had 'high', 'critical', and 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurement, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions CONCLUSION: In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 is suboptimal.

Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of COVID-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS: We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The nine questions of the survey focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and the UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. RESULTS: Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries. Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and the UK, leading to an estimate range of 1.3-2.2 million in Europe. Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability. This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care. When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-COVID-19 patients' needs.","output":"Up to 2.2 million people experiencing disability suffer collateral damage each day of COVID-19 lockdown in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid shift in student education style from face-to-face to electronic learning.

Objective To investigate the usability and acceptability of the VP application with a focus on exploring perspectives on accessibility. Methods The study used an exploratory sequential mixed method design consisting of a satisfaction survey and interviews. Survey data were analysed descriptively to assess satisfaction with the application and to identify interview discussion areas. Interview data were analysed using the Framework Approach to thematic analysis. Participants were hospital or community pharmacists, or pre-registration pharmacists. Results A total of 94 survey responses were collected and 22 respondents went on to take part in an interview. Participants reported liking the concept and delivery of the VP, particularly the high-quality technology. They also reported finding it usable, and appeared to favour its mobility and accessibility, particularly as the VP can be used on any internet accessible device, including mobile phones, with no specific requirements. Amendments that were suggested included quickening the delivery of some animations and improving navigation within the application, possibly through a button to return to the previous step should a mistake be made.

The latter specifically includes diet and lifestyle factors during pandemic restrictions. We also cover the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through food products and the food chain, as well as virus persistence on different surfaces and in different environmental conditions, which were major public concerns during the initial days of the pandemic, but have since waned in public attention. We discuss useful measures to avoid the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread through food, and approaches that may reduce the risk of contamination with the highly contagious virus. While hygienic protocols are required in food supply sectors, cleaning, disinfection, avoidance of cross-contamination across food categories, and foodstuffs at different stages of the manufacturing process are still particularly relevant because the virus persists at length on inert materials such as food packaging. Moreover, personal hygiene (frequent washing and disinfection), wearing gloves, and proper use of masks, clothes, and footwear dedicated to maintaining hygiene, provide on-site protections for food sector employees as well as supply chain intermediates and consumers. Finally, we emphasize the importance of following a healthy diet and maintaining a lifestyle that promotes physical well-being and supports healthy immune system function, especially when government movement restrictions (lockdowns) are implemented.","output":"Changes in Dietary Patterns and Clinical Health Outcomes in Different Countries during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The establishment of decentralized drinking water systems in urban areas is technically and financially feasible, and these off-grid systems can complement investment in traditional piped water systems. However, users often see off-grid systems as the second-best option, compared to citywide piped water systems.

We undertook a study to learn the impact of the COVID\\\\19 lockdown on wildlife and forests in the protected areas (PAs) of Nepal. Between July and September 2020, data on illegal activities recorded by the staff of PAs and also those reported by media were collected and analyzed. Key informant interviews (KII) were done with the park officers and security personnel by virtual communication (telephone, messenger app, and video call) to collect detailed information and for corroboration.

Yet, there has been little focus on the nature of the relationship between financial crises and environmental sustainability, especially in relation to forests and deforestation. This study addressed this gap by providing novel evidence on the impact of financial crises on deforestation. A panel data approach is used looking at Global Forest Watch deforestation data from > 150 countries in > 100 crises in the twenty-first century. This includes an analysis of crises effects on principle drivers of deforestation; timber and agricultural commoditiespalm oil, soybean, coffee, cattle, and cocoa. At a global level, financial crises are associated with a reduction in deforestation rates (? 36 p.p) and deforestation drivers; roundwood (? 6.7 p.p.), cattle (? 2.3 p.p.) and cocoa production (? 8.3 p.p.). Regionally, deforestation rates in Asia, Africa, and Europe decreased by ? 83, ? 43, and 22 p.p, respectively. Drivers behind these effects may be different, from palm oil (? 1.3 p.p.) and cocoa (? 10.5 p.p.) reductions in Africa, to a combination of timber (? 9.5 p.p) and palm oil in Asia. Moreover, financial crises have a larger effect on deforestation in low-income, than upper middle- and high-income countries (? 51 vs ? 39 and ? 18 p.p. respectively). Using another main dataset on yearly forest coverthe ESA-Climate Change Initiativea picture arises showing financial crises leading to small global decreases in forest cover (? 0.1 p.p.) with a small agricultural cover increase (0.1 p.p). Our findings point to financial crises as important moments for global deforestation dynamics. Yet, to consolidate benefits on decreasing deforestation, governments need to enhance their sustainable forest management during crisis periods rather than let it slip down national agendas.

Remarkably, these factors strongly interact. DISCUSSION: This paper highlights the importance of homogenization of responsibilities of governments regarding integrated care and the interdependency of policy and health care system factors. A whole system change is needed instead of the current Belgian model of prolonged search for common ground between conflicting opinions. Political commitment and citizen participation will be crucial.","output":"What Makes Integration of Chronic Care so Difficult?

In addition to significant contribution to neonatal mortality, impact of prematurity among survivors may continue through life impairing long-term physical life through neuro-disability and increased risk of cerebral palsy. Maternal administration of magnesium sulfate prior to impending preterm birth is an effective strategy to reduce neuromorbidity. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of antenatal magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection in preterm infants between 26 and 34 weeks in preventing early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary objective was to assess any adverse events with the use of magnesium sulfate on the mother and neonate. METHOD: This was a prospective observational comparative study for 2 years at our tertiary care hospital of 100 pregnant women who gave preterm births. Fifty infants each were born to mothers who were either not given MgSO(4) (Group 1) or given 4gm intravenous loading dose MgSO(4) (Group 2), preferably 4 h prior to preterm birth. RESULTS: Among all the preterm in our study, 81% delivered between 30 and 34 weeks. There was no significant difference in terms of maternal mortality or serious morbidity including postpartum hemorrhage, caesarian section rates or length of hospital stay among women receiving MgSO(4) versus no MgSO(4). Mild maternal side effects secondary to magnesium sulfate were experienced in 8% cases. There were no significant differences between both groups for low 5 min APGAR, need for NICU admission, neonatal convulsions, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia and septicemia. There was a trend toward reduced risk in the magnesium sulfate group for need for mechanical ventilation and ongoing respiratory support, intraventricular hemorrhage, neonatal hypotension, hypothermia, length of NICU stay. IVH was less frequent and less severe in babies exposed to antenatal MgSO(4) (8%) as compared to non-MgSO(4) group (16%). Neonatal morbidities were more when antenatal MgSO(4) was given less than 4 h from delivery. CONCLUSION: MgSO(4) is a safe drug to use in antenatal women at risk for impending preterm. Antenatal magnesium sulfate given to women in established preterm labor conferred significant neuroprotective advantage to the neonate. MgSO(4) also has protective effect on the need of invasive ventilatory support in preterm infants. Given the breadth of evidence in its favor, it is time for us to start using MgSO(4) in clinical practice for neuroprotective intent in all our extreme preterm births.","output":"Efficacy of Antenatal Magnesium Sulfate for Neuroprotection in Extreme Prematurity: A Comparative Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT: The study aimed to utilize the peripheral blood immunological parameters and resulting individual and combined inflammatory indices [neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) and C-reactive protein/lymphocyte ratio (CLR)] in predicting the prognosis and mortality in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The measurements of individual and combined inflammatory indices (NLR, LMR and CLR) were performed at hospital admission and at last day of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Prominent elevation of NLR and CLR among patients with refractory disease admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deceased patients was found when compared with moderate ill patients and healthy controls. Interestingly, NLR and CLR typically returned to near normal value as patients recover from severe infection. By contrast, deceased patients had persistent increased NLR and CLR until last day of hospitalization in ICU. ROC obtained for the above parameters showed that NLR and CLR were the most associated immunological parameters with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, CLR > 69.46 is an independent prognostic factors in identifying critically ill COVID-19 cases. Study of the combined markers NLR and CLR showed that most of patients admitted in ICU were characterized with high NLR combined with high CLR, while most of healthy subjects and non-ICU group have low NLR combined with low CLR.

Our study was designed to reveal the pharmacological activities, the active compounds, and the pharmacological mechanisms of TXS for atopic dermatitis. Mice were induced by 2,4-dinitrocluorobenzene (DNCB) to build atopic dermatitis model. The pathological evaluation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) assay were performed. The UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS(E) and network pharmacology analysis were performed to explore active ingredients and therapeutic mechanisms of TXS. TXS treatment decreased levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) in serum induced by DNCB. TXS reduced scratching behavior and alleviated inflammatory pathology of skin and ear. Meanwhile, TXS decreased the spleen index and increased spleen index. The UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS(E) results showed that 65 compounds of TXS were detected and 337 targets were fished.

The KEGG pathway and GO analysis showed that TXS remedied atopic dermatitis via PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway with the regulation of inflammatory response and transcription. Further, we found that the targets of PTGS2 and HSP90AA1 were both elevated in ears and skin of AD model mouse; however, TXS decreased the elevated expressions of PTGS2 and HSP90AA1.

We show that a novel lineage of distal airway secretory cells, intralobar serous (IS) cells, are activated to assume BC fates following influenza virus infection. Nascent BC differ from pre-existing BC by high expression of IL-22ra1 and undergo IL-22-dependent expansion for colonization of injured alveoli. Resolution of virus-elicited inflammation resulted in BC>IS re-differentiation in repopulated alveoli, and increased local expression of antimicrobial factors, but failed to replace normal alveolar epithelium.

The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient 2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and droplets may pass through the gap.

It is motivated by the problem of rounding noisy measurements from some continuous space such as ?d to a discrete subset of representative values, in which each tile in the partition is defined as the preimage of one of the output points. Standard rounding schemes seem to be inherently discontinuous across tile boundaries, but in this paper we show how to make it perfectly consistent (with error resilience ) by guaranteeing that any pair of consecutive measurements X1 and X2 whose L2 distance is bounded by  will be rounded to the same nearby representative point in the discrete output space. We achieve this resilience by allowing a few bits of information about the first measurement X1 to be unidirectionally communicated to and used by the rounding process of the second measurement X2. Minimizing this revealed information can be particularly important in privacy-sensitive applications such as COVID-19 contact tracing, in which we want to find out all the cases in which two persons were at roughly the same place at roughly the same time, by comparing cryptographically hashed versions of their itineraries in an error resilient way. The main problem we study in this paper is characterizing the achievable tradeoffs between the amount of information provided and the error resilience for various dimensions. We analyze the problem by considering the possible colored tilings of the space with k available colors, and use the color of the tile in which X1 resides as the side information.

The aim of this rapid review was to review the impact of WAH on individual workers mental and physical health, and determine any gender difference, to develop recommendations for employers and employees to optimise workers health. METHOD: A search was undertaken in three databases, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and Web of Science, from 2007 to May 2020. Selection criteria included studies which involved employees who regularly worked at home, and specifically reported on physical or mental health-related outcomes. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, one author extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments with review by a second author. RESULTS: Twenty-three papers meet the selection criteria for this review. Ten health outcomes were reported: pain, self-reported health, safety, well-being, stress, depression, fatigue, quality of life, strain and happiness. The impact on health outcomes was strongly influenced by the degree of organisational support available to employees, colleague support, social connectedness (outside of work), and levels of work to family conflict. Overall, women were less likely to experience improved health outcomes when WAH. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified several health outcomes affected by WAH. The health/work relationship is complex and requires consideration of broader system factors to optimise the effects of WAH on workers health. It is likely mandated WAH will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future; organisations will need to implement formalised WAH policies that consider work-home boundary management support, role clarity, workload, performance indicators, technical support, facilitation of co-worker networking, and training for managers.","output":"A rapid review of mental and physical health effects of working at home: how do we optimise health?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents with a large variety of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carrier state to severe respiratory distress, multiple organ dysfunction and death. While it was initially considered primarily a respiratory illness, rapidly accumulating data suggests that COVID-19 results in a unique, profoundly prothrombotic milieu leading to both arterial and venous thrombosis. Consistently, elevated D-dimer level has emerged as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes, including death. Several other laboratory markers and blood counts have also been associated with poor prognosis, possibly due to their connection to thrombosis. At present, the pathophysiology underlying the hypercoagulable state is poorly understood. However, a growing body of data suggests that the initial events occur in the lung. A severe inflammatory response, originating in the alveoli, triggers a dysfunctional cascade of inflammatory thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a state of local coagulopathy. This is followed, in patients with more severe disease, by a generalized hypercoagulable state that results in macro- and microvascular thrombosis. Of concern, is the observation that anticoagulation may be inadequate in many circumstances, highlighting the need for alternative or additional therapies.

Results: Among the patients with liver cirrhosis, the case group with COVID-19 was found to be significantly less exposed to spironolactone compared with the control group without COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the two groups was 0.20 (0.07C0.54). In addition, regardless of cumulative dose of spironolactone, exposure to spironolactone was associated with lower COVID-19 infection. In terms of the development of complications due to COVID-19, spironolactone did not show any significant association between the patients with and without complications (P = 0.43). The adjusted OR and 95% CI between the two groups was 1.714 (0.246C11.938). Conclusion: We conclude that spironolactone may reduce susceptibility to COVID-19 but does not affect the development of its associated complications; however, further studies are needed to confirm the exact association between spironolactone and COVID-19 infection.","output":"Effect of Spironolactone on COVID-19 in Patients With Underlying Liver Cirrhosis: A Nationwide Case-Control Study in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of government interventions in epidemic has become a hot subject since the onset of COVID-19. There is however much variation in the results quantifying the effects of interventions, which is partly related to the varying modelling approaches employed by existing studies. This paper therefore aims to examine how the choice of modelling approach would affect the estimation results of intervention effects, by experimenting with different modelling approaches on a same data set composed of the 500 most affected U.S. counties. We compare the most frequently used methods from the two classes of modelling approaches, which are Bayesian hierarchical model from the class of computational approach and difference-in-difference from the class of natural experimental approach. We find that computational methods are likely to produce larger estimates of intervention effects due to simultaneous voluntary behavioral changes. In contrast, natural experimental methods are more likely to extract the true effect of interventions. Among different difference-in-difference estimators, the two-way fixed effect estimator seems to be an efficient one. Our work can inform the methodological choice of future research on this topic, as well as more robust re-interpretation of existing works, to facilitate both future epidemic response plans and the science of public health.","output":"Impact of Modelling Approach on the Estimation of Government Intervention Effects in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the correlation between demographic and healthcare availability indicators with COVID-19 outcome among Indonesian provinces. Methods: We employed an ecological study design to study the correlation between demographics, healthcare availability, and COVID-19 indicators. Demographic and healthcare indicators were obtained from the Indonesian Health Profile of 2019 by the Ministry of Health while COVID-19 indicators were obtained from the Indonesian COVID-19 website in August 31st 2020. Non-parametric correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 23.0. Results: We found the number of confirmed cases and case growth to be significantly correlated with demographic indicators, especially with distribution of age groups. Confirmed cases and case growth was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with population density (correlation coefficient of 0.461 and 0.491) and proportion of young people (?0.377; ?0.394). Incidence and incidence growth were correlated with ratios of GPs (0.426; 0.534), hospitals (0.376; 0.431), primary care clinics (0.423; 0.424), and hospital beds (0.472; 0.599) per capita. For mortality, case fatality rate (CFR) was correlated with population density (0.390) whereas mortality rate was correlated with ratio of hospital beds (0.387). Multivariate analyses found confirmed case independently associated with population density ( of 0.638) and demographic structure (?0.289). Case growth was independently associated with density (0.763). Incidence growth was independently associated with hospital bed ratio (0.486). Conclusion: Pre-existing inequality of healthcare availability correlates with current reported incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19. Lack of healthcare availability in some provinces may have resulted in artificially low numbers of cases being diagnosed, lower demands for COVID-19 tests, and eventually lower case-findings.","output":"Correlation of Demographics, Healthcare Availability, and COVID-19 Outcome: Indonesian Ecological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome of respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar damage that results from dysregulated local and systemic immune activation, causing pulmonary vascular, parenchymal and alveolar damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection has become the dominant cause of ARDS worldwide, and emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and their cytotoxic arsenal of effector functions as central drivers of immune-mediated lung injury in COVID-19 ARDS. However, a key outstanding question is whether COVID-19 drives a unique program of neutrophil activation or effector functions that contributes to the severe pathogenesis of this pandemic illness, and whether this unique neutrophil response can be targeted to attenuate disease. Using a combination of high-dimensional single cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID ARDS (caused by bacterial pneumonia), we identified a functionally distinct landscape of neutrophil activation in COVID-19 ARDS that was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, neutrophils in COVID-19 ARDS were functionally primed to produce high amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Surprisingly, this unique pathological program of neutrophil priming escaped conventional therapy with dexamethasone, thereby revealing a promising target for adjunctive immunotherapy in severe COVID-19.","output":"A functionally distinct neutrophil landscape in severe COVID-19 reveals opportunities for adjunctive therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Commentary describes a call for submissions for the upcoming Special Issue focused on the science presented at the 20(th) IUPAB Congress to be held in conjunction with the 45(th) Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Biophysical Society and the 49(th) Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","output":"Announcing the call for the Special Issue on the 20(th) International Congress of the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB)virtual meeting, October 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We offer three recommendations to increase coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rates.

This is a frontline component of the innate immune system with specificity for different pathogen classes. It occurs in the context of numerous interactions with leukocytes, but here we focus on intrinsic epithelial mechanisms. Type 1 immune responses are directed primarily at intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses. Prominent stimuli include microbial nucleic acids and interferons released from neighboring epithelial cells. Epithelial responses revolve around changes in the expression of interferon-sensitive genes (ISGs) that interfere with viral replication, as well as the further induction of interferons that signal in autocrine and paracrine manners. Type 2 immune responses are directed primarily at helminths and fungi. Prominent pathogen stimuli include proteases and chitin, and important responses include mucin hypersecretion and chitinase release. Type 3 immune responses are directed primarily at extracellular microbial pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, as well as viruses during their extracellular phase of infection. Prominent microbial stimuli include bacterial wall components, such as lipopeptides and endotoxin, as well as microbial nucleic acids. Key responses are the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). For all three types of response, paracrine signaling to neighboring epithelial cells induces resistance to infection over a wide field. Often, the epithelial effector molecules themselves also have signaling properties, in addition to the release of inflammatory cytokines that boost local innate immunity. Together, these epithelial mechanisms provide a powerful first line of pathogen defense, recruit leukocytes, and instruct adaptive immune responses.","output":"Airway Epithelial Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious health concern which affects all healthcare professionals worldwide.

METHODOLOGY: In May 2020, electronic study questionnaires on Microsoft Forms were distributed to a sample of 886 Riyadh residents via social media and WhatsApp groups. RESULTS: We found that the participants had good knowledge. However, less than half of the participants exhibited positive attitudes and good practices toward COVID-19. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between their practices, attitudes, and knowledge. The most practiced behaviours among the participants were (1) a commitment to home quarantine, (2) the use of a tissue or the inside of an elbow when coughing or sneezing, (3) hand washing for a minimum of 20 seconds, and (4) sterilization of surfaces/equipment and wearing masks in public places. Regression analysis showed that knowledge, attitudes, and age were the three factors that could predict the practices of preventive behaviours against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A higher likelihood of practicing preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with one's total knowledge and attitude scores. Future educational campaigns are recommended to focus on residents' susceptibility to COVID-19, its severity, mask wearing, and the disinfection of surfaces and appliances when targeting public audiences.

This study aims to discover the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female healthcare professionals (HCPs) treating COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. METHODS: Using an empirical phenomenological methodology, semi-structured telephone-based qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 female HCPs who were providing their expertise for COVID-19 patients in tertiary-level hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. Purposive sampling was used for recruitment. The interviews were conducted between 20 July and 20 August 2020. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: This study explored the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female HCPs serving COVID-19 patients. Five themes were observed in the interviews: apprehension while treating COVID-19 patients; feelings towards COVID-19 patients; challenges as female HCPs and coping strategies; confidence in government, administration and self-reflection; and finally, future concerns and recommendations. Many of these themes have also been linked with cultural issues, making the results specific to Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, female frontline HCPs have faced immense psychosocial pressure, ranging from unsupportive family norms to an unwelcoming working environment and insensitive hospital administrations. Moreover, rumours among the general public, lack of proper training, missing incentives and improper system surveillance have increased the anxiety and stress among HCPs.

METHODS: Quercetin microparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification via a phase inversion technique, using tristearin as the lipid component and phosphatidylcholine as an emulsifier. The quercetin SLMs were characterised for morphology, drug loading (15.5%  0.6, which corresponded to an encapsulation efficiency of 71.4%), particle size distribution, response to humidity, crystallinity, thermal behaviour and in vitro respirable fraction. Furthermore, the toxicity and the in vitro transport of the SLMs on an air liquid interface model of the Calu-3 cell line were also investigated using a modified twin-stage impinger apparatus. RESULTS: Results showed that quercetin SLMs could be formulated as dry powder suitable for inhalation drug delivery (20.5  3.3% fine particle fraction ?4.46 m) that was absorbed, via a linear kinetic model across the Calu-3 monolayer (22.32  1.51% over 4 h). In addition, quercetin SLMs were shown to be non-toxic at the concentrations investigated.

Here, the silver ions (Ag+) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 (HT18C6) were used for the first time as a redox probe. Then, the HT18C6(Ag) incorporated carbon paste electrode (CPE) was further modified with chitosan and PAMAM dendrimer-coated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs@PAMAM) for immobilization of probe sequences (aminated oligonucleotides). The current intensity of differential pulse voltammetry using the redox probe was found to decrease with increasing the concentration of target sequence. Based on such signal-off trend, the proposed genosensor exhibited a good linear response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRP in the concentration range 1.0 pM-8.0 nM with a regression equation I (A) = - 6.555 log [RdRP sequence] (pM) + 32.676 (R2 = 0.995) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pM.

The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology.

Competencies in interprofessional working need developing in undergraduate educational preparation. This paper reports the protocol for a systematic review of self-report instruments to assess interprofessional learning in undergraduate health professionals' education. METHODS We will search PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and ERIC from January 2010 onwards. A combination of search terms for interprofessional learning, health professions, psychometric properties, assessment of learning and assessment tools will be used. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts and full-texts. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Quantitative and mixed-methods studies evaluating interprofessional learning in undergraduate health professions education (e.g. medicine, nursing, occupational and physical therapy, pharmacy and psychology) will be included. Methodological quality of each reported instrument, underpinning theoretical frameworks, and the effects of reported interventions will be assessed. The overall outcome will be the effectiveness of instruments used to assess interprofessional competence. Primary outcomes will be the psychometric properties (e.g. reliability, discriminant and internal validity) of instruments used. Secondary outcomes will include time from intervention to assessment, how items relate to specific performance/competencies (or general abstract constructs) and how scores are used (e.g. to grade students, to improve courses or research purposes). Quantitative summaries in tabular format and a narrative synthesis will allow recommendations to be made on the use of self-report instruments in practice.

Resveratrol appeared to activate NK cells most effectively among the substances tested and synergistically increased IFN-?3 secretion and NK cell cytotoxicity with interleukin-2 (IL-2). CD107a, NKp30, and NKG2D expression levels were upregulated on the surface of NK cells upon treatment with resveratrol in combination with IL-2 compared with treatment with IL-2 alone. Moreover, NK cell activity in human and mouse whole blood was enhanced upon treatment with resveratrol. Most importantly, administration of resveratrol effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis in mice. In conclusion, we suggest that resveratrol may represent a candidate anti-cancer drug that acts by activating NK cells in vivo.","output":"In vivo Anti-Cancer Effects of Resveratrol Mediated by NK Cell Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regenerative capacity declines throughout evolution and with age. In this study, we asked whether metabolic programs underlying regenerative capability might be conserved across species, and if so, whether such metabolic drivers might be harnessed to promote tissue repair. To this end, we conducted metabolomic analyses in two vertebrate organ regeneration models: the axolotl limb blastema and antler stem cells. To further reveal why young individuals have higher regenerative capacity than the elderly, we also constructed metabolic profiles for primate juvenile and aged tissues, as well as young and aged human stem cells. In joint analyses, we uncovered that active pyrimidine metabolism and fatty acid metabolism correlated with higher regenerative capacity. Furthermore, we identified a set of regeneration-related metabolite effectors conserved across species. One such metabolite is uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, which can rejuvenate aged human stem cells and promote regeneration of various tissues in vivo. These observations will open new avenues for metabolic intervention in tissue repair and regeneration.","output":"Cross-species metabolomic analysis identifies uridine as a potent regeneration promoting factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Force-majeure and Frustration are contract principles which are very significant in the present context of Covid-19 pandemic.

However, with the emerging unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have already changed the way we live, work, and travel, encouraging a change in commuter behavior has become even more important. This has necessitated that existing strategies be reconsidered in favor of adapting to a highly uncertain ?COVID-19 world.? Historically, there has been a dearth of literature relating to airport employees? ground access even though as a group employees represent an important segment of airport users with complex access requirements. This paper therefore focuses on airport employee related airport ground access strategies considering an emerging understanding of the future impacts of COVID-19 on global air travel. Pre-COVID strategies are investigated by conducting a documentary analysis of the most recent ground access strategies of 27 UK airports. The findings reveal that airport ground access strategies were mainly focused on setting targets and producing policy measures in favor of reducing car use and increasing the use of more sustainable transport modes including public transport, car sharing, and active travel (walking, cycling). However, measures encouraging public transport and car sharing will be more difficult to implement because of social distancing and fear of proximity to others. Instead, initiatives encouraging remote working, active travel, and improved staff awareness will be at the forefront of the future ground access strategy development.","output":"Investigation of Employee Related Airport Ground Access Strategies from a Post-COVID Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the most relevant literature published in 2021 on the role of cardiovascular imaging in cardiovascular medicine.

We estimated the savings in CO (2 )emissions of an international cohort of masters students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO (2) and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO (2). The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO (2). Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK.

The present study retrospectively evaluated the type and prevalence of lung perfusion defects in earlyCpost-COVID-19 patients with hypoxia and was aimed to identify the risk factors for mismatched perfusion defects. Methods: We analyzed SPECT/CT images of 54 earlyCpost-COVID-19 patients (44 men and 10 women). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the risk. Results: The mean age of the study population was 55.4 y (range, 34C76 y). All received prophylactic anticoagulation from the day of hospitalization to the date of perfusion scanning. The median interval between COVID-19Cpositive reports and lung perfusion scanning was 22 d. Lung perfusion defects (of any type) were observed in most (87%). Twenty-three subjects (42.6%) had mismatched perfusion defects. Mismatched perfusion defects were segmental in 14 subjects (25.9%) and subsegmental in 11 (20.4%). Higher age was a risk factor for mismatched perfusion defects (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99C1.13; P = 0.06). Subjects with a serum D-dimer level of at least 2,500 ng/mL on the day before the scan were not at higher risk for having mismatched perfusion defects (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.34C3.9; P = 0.83). Conclusion: Despite prophylactic anticoagulation, mismatched perfusion defects suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism were observed. Serum D-dimer level in patients early after COVID-19 is a poor predictor of mismatched perfusion defects.

Considering the significance of reducing undernourishment, the current study focuses on exploring the macroeconomic determinants of undernourishment in the South Asian panel. The study employed econometric models that are more robust to underpin cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity in a panel data set. The overall findings reveal that an increase in food production increases undernourishment and infer that food availability at the national level is insufficient to reduce undernourishment unless poor people also had economic and physical access to food. In the case of economic growth and governance, the results are negatively significant in some countries. The results infer that GDP and quality of governance are nuanced in declining the rate of undernourishment in some countries, while in other countries where the results are found insignificant, the government should seek other interventions to curtail the prevalence of undernourishment. Unexpectedly, an increase in food prices lessens the undernourishment in developing countries that reflect that food prices might transform the dietary patterns of poor people from nutrient-rich foods to nutrient-poor staples, thus lead to undernourishment reduction but trigger overweight and obesity alongside.

Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has the potential to detect any virus present in a patient sample and is increasingly being used for difficult to diagnose cases. The aim of this study was to analyse the performance of mNGS for viral pathogen detection in the clinical setting of international travellers returning with febrile illness. Methods Thirty-eight serum samples from international travellers returning with febrile illness and presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands in the time period 2015-2016 were selected retrospectively. Samples were processed for viral metagenomic sequencing using a probe panel capturing all known vertebrate viruses. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using Genome Detective software for metagenomic virus detection. Metagenomic virus findings were compared with viral pathogen detection using conventional methods. Results In 8 out of the 38 patients (21%), a pathogenic virus was detected by mNGS. All viral pathogens detected by conventional assays were also detected by mNGS: dengue virus (n=4 patients), Epstein-Barr virus (n=2), hepatitis B virus (n=1). In addition, mNGS resulted in additional pathogenic findings in 2 patients (5%): dengue virus (n=1), and hepatitis C virus (n=1). Non-pathogenic viruses detected were: GB virus C (n=1) and torque teno viruses (n=3). High genome coverage and depth using capture probes enabled typing of the dengue viruses detected. Conclusions Viral metagenomics has the potential to assist the detection of viral pathogens and co-infections in one step in international travellers with a febrile syndrome.

Of all the regions worldwide, Latin America has experienced the slowest decline in adolescent fertility rates. Reports published by the United Nations and multiple nongovernmental organizations demonstrate a growing consensus for a masculinities framework that engages men and boys in public health and social change. Male engagement acts as a complement - and not a replacement - of current SRH. Emerging evidence indicates that Coronavirus disease in 2019 has worsened SRH outcomes, especially related to gender-based violence;new evidence-based interventions are ever more urgent. This systematic review includes a focus on education-based male engagement, a special consideration of gender equity, and systematic searches by fluent speakers in three most populous languages in the Americas (English, Spanish, and Portuguese). PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases were digitally searched. Publications were excluded if their focus did not align directly with sexual reproductive health, their location was outside the scope of study, its content derived from information collected before 2010, or its studys populations age of focus was not between 15-24 years of age.

The results were classified by geographic regions of the American continent. The literature emphasized that society often defines masculinity as a hegemonic role grounded in aggressive high-risk sexual behavior. Adolescent males internalize this and hold their peers to these expectations. These beliefs have detrimental SRH consequences that have yet to be fully understood among adolescent boys and males.

In the context of the application of big data in health and medicine, the integration of data mining skills into postgraduate medical education becomes important. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the design and implementation of a medical data mining course for medical postgraduates with diverse backgrounds in a medical school. METHODS: We developed a medical data mining course called Practical Techniques of Medical Data Mining for postgraduate medical education and taught the course online at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). To identify the background knowledge, programming skills, and expectations of targeted learners, we conducted a web-based questionnaire survey. After determining the instructional methods to be used in the course, three technical platformsRain Classroom, Tencent Meeting, and WeChatwere chosen for online teaching. A medical data mining platform called Medical Data Mining - R Programming Hub (MedHub) was developed for self-learning, which could support the development and comprehensive testing of data mining algorithms. Finally, we carried out a postcourse survey and a case study to demonstrate that our online course could accommodate a diverse group of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience. RESULTS: In total, 200 postgraduates from 30 disciplines participated in the precourse survey. Based on the analysis of students characteristics and expectations, we designed an optimized course structured into nine logical teaching units (one 4-hour unit per week for 9 weeks). The course covered basic knowledge of R programming, machine learning models, clinical data mining, and omics data mining, among other topics, as well as diversified health care analysis scenarios. Finally, this 9-week course was successfully implemented in an online format from May to July in the spring semester of 2020 at PUMC. A total of 6 faculty members and 317 students participated in the course.

To date, no specific antiviral agent has proved uniformly effective against SARS-CoV-2. Favipiravir, the recommended drug by the Turkish Ministry of Health, was uniformly supplied to all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test. The aim of our study was to retrospectively compare our kidney transplant recipients treated with favipiravir who developed COVID-19 infection versus those not treated with favipiravir during the clinical course of the disease, with a special emphasis on the occurrence of side effects and adverse events. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included 37 consecutive kidney transplant recipients with a median age of 46 years (62.2% women). Recipients included 8 with deceased donors and 29 with living related donors; median posttransplant survival was 8.0 years (IQR, 5.5-12.5 years). RESULTS Twenty-six patients (70.3%) received favipiravir, and 11 (29.7%) did not. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for baseline demographic characteristics and clinical and laboratory data, except that the favipiravir-treated patients were older and had a higher requirement of oxygen treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for the course and outcome of COVID-19 infection with regard to adverse side effects/events associated with favipiravir. Laboratory data at baseline, day 7, and day 30 were also comparable between the groups.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the assessment of risk and model the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Variables associated with hospital mortality using bivariate analysis were included as potential independent predictors associated with mortality at the p <0.05levels. RESULTS: We included 114 studies accounting for 310,494 patients from various parts of the world. For the purpose of this analysis, we set a cutoff point of 10% for the mortality percentages. High mortality rates were defined as higher than 10% of confirmed positive cases and were given a score of two, while low mortality percentage (<10%) was assigned to the score of one. We then analyzed the associations between 72 variables and the observed mortality rates. These variables included a large range of related conditions such as demographics, signs and symptoms and related morbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, imaging studies, underlying diseases, and the status of countries' income based on United Nation's classifications. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that older age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus conferred a significant increased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. In the multivariate analysis, only diabetes mellitus demonstrated an independent relationship with increased mortality.

Following a pilot study, the questionnaire was shared among surgery residents, and response collection was done. The residents who did not attend at least 90% of scheduled classes were excluded. A total of 55 resident doctors without prior experience of online teaching program were enrolled in the study. All the participants responded to all questions and submitted their responses within stipulated time. On the basis of validity testing, questions 1 and 2 were found invalid and hence deleted. The median value for the total cohort was 4 indicating that majority of residents gave affirmative response.

We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital revenue and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation models. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age estimated the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 160 to 130%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross revenue per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross revenue when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue. In these estimates, adopting universal masking would help to avoid overcapacity in all states.","output":"Balancing revenue generation with capacity generation: case distribution, financial impact and hospital capacity changes from cancelling or resuming elective surgeries in the US during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The information on the incidence, seasonal variation and clinical pattern of respiratory virus infections is very important for clinicians in managing their patients. This study was aimed to define the epidemiology of respiratory viral pathogens in Seoul and the neighboring areas from March 2004 to February 2006. METHODS A total of 6,533 specimens were cultured for respiratory viruses during the study period. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), LLC-MK2, and HEp-2 cells, or R-mix cells (Diagnostic Hybrids Inc., Athens, Ohio, USA) were used for culture. Influenza virus types A & B (Inf A & B), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (ADV) were identified by indirect immuno-fluorescent staining. Medical records of the patients with positive virus cultures were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS One or more viral agents were isolated from 1682 specimens (25.7%). The pathogens identified were RSV 37.2%, ADV 19.9%, Inf A 18.9%, PIV 17.5% and Inf B 6.4%. The most frequent pathogen of pneumonia and acute bronchiolitis was RSV and that of croup was PIV. Upper respiratory tract infections were more prevalent in adults and the most frequently caused by influenza virus. Influenza virus itself was more frequently isolated in children less than six years old, which was different from previous reports. Influenza virus was mostly isolated in the winter and spring, while RSV was usually isolated from early fall with a peak incidence in the winter. Inf A and RSV showed a dampening effect on the occurrence of other viruses during their major epidemic. PIV was mostly detected in the spring and summer. ADV was isolated throughout the whole year. CONCLUSIONS The epidemiological characteristics of respiratory virus infections in Seoul and the neighboring areas in 2004-2006, were similar to the findings of previous reports except for some minor changes.

One of the most vital components of the transfer to adult care is medication adherence. Poor medication adherence puts patients at risk for worse outcomes, with the most profound being increased mortality for many conditions.

However, the long-term impact after recovery, which is critical to advance our understanding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-associated long-term complications, remains largely unknown. Herein, we characterized multi-omic single-cell profiles of circulating immune cells in the peripheral blood of 100 patients, including covenlesent COVID-19 and sero-negative controls. The reduced frequencies of both short-lived monocytes and long-lived regulatory T (Treg) cells are significantly associated with the patients recovered from severe COVID-19. Consistently, sc-RNA seq analysis reveals seven heterogeneous clusters of monocytes (M0-M6) and ten Treg clusters (T0-T9) featuring distinct molecular signatures and associated with COVID-19 severity. Asymptomatic patients contain the most abundant clusters of monocyte and Treg expressing high CD74 or IFN-responsive genes. In contrast, the patients recovered from a severe disease have shown two dominant inflammatory monocyte clusters with S100 family genes: S100A8 & A9 with high HLA-I whereas S100A4 & A6 with high HLA-II genes, a specific non-classical monocyte cluster with distinct IFITM family genes, and a unique TGF-{beta} high Treg Cluster. The outpatients and seronegative controls share most of the monocyte and Treg clusters patterns with high expression of HLA genes. Surprisingly, while presumably short-ived monocytes appear to have sustained alterations over 4 months, the decreased frequencies of long-lived Tregs (high HLA-DRA and S100A6) in the outpatients restore over the tested convalescent time (>= 4 months).

Case presentation In this paper, we report a case of optic neuritis concomitant with an undiagnosed pituitary macroadenoma discovered during active COVID-19 infection. The case was a 33-year-old woman with infertility who was recently found to have a pituitary macroadenoma secreting prolactin. During active COVID-19 infection, the patient developed optic neuritis that responded well to corticosteroids. Brain imaging and hormonal profile negated the presence of any demyelinating disease or pituitary apoplexy. Clinical discussion A dilemma of whether optic neuritis occurring concomitantly with pituitary macroadenoma is just a coincidence, or there is an association remains unresolved. Whether COVID-19 infection might precipitate optic neuritis in patients with pituitary macroadenoma or not remains an issue to be answered by observing data from future case reports about similar findings. Conclusion Optic neuritis in concomitant with pituitary macroadenoma following COVID-19 infection represents a dilemma of whether the visual symptoms are attributed to the tumor or COVID-19 infection.","output":"Optic Neuritis Concomitant with Pituitary Macroadenoma in a Patient with Active COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on syphilis rates is unknown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). RESULTS: The ECLIA serological assay performed best and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. CONCLUSION: The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection serology validation of different methods: Usefulness of IgA in the early phase of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify the engagement of health sciences librarians (HSLs) in open science (OS) through the delivery of library services, support, and programs for researchers.

It is hoped that existing antivirals including remdesivir and lopinavir-ritonavir might have roles in the treatment of COVID-19, but results from trials thus far have not been promising. COVID-19 causes a mild respiratory disease in the majority of cases, but in some cases, cytokine activation causes sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to morbidity and mortality. Immunomodulatory treatments and biologics are also being actively explored as therapeutics for COVID-19. On the other hand, the use of steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been discouraged based on concerns about their adverse effects. Over the past two decades, coronaviruses have caused major epidemics and outbreaks worldwide, whilst modern medicine has been playing catch-up all along.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): latest developments in potential treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present here data regarding ADM in patients with COVID-19. Starting from March 2020, we included 45 adult patients presenting with signs of respiratory infection (cough and/or fever) to the Emergency Department in this ongoing study. ADM expression was significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 than other respiratory infections despite similar clinical features at admission. In patients with COVID-19, ADM expression was significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in patients with less severe COVID-19. Further, ADM expression was not significantly different between patients with less severe COVID-19 and patients with other respiratory infections than COVID-19. According to ROC-analysis, ADM was able to differentiate severe from non-severe COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.82. Our findings suggest a potential role for ADM in severe COVID-19. While ADM might be a therapeutic target in sepsis and septic shock, further research is needed regarding ADM in COVID-19. Further, the diagnostic potential of ADM as a marker for progression to severe COVID-19 at first medical contact should be evaluated.","output":"RNA-expression of adrenomedullin is increased in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As colleagues have noted in The Round Table in recent months, the Covid-19 pandemic is forcing a rethinking of international education within the Commonwealth. Several commentators have suggested that the Commonwealth, La Francophonie and national associations of universities and colleges are well placed to coordinate efforts for global education, distance learning and shared research. We suggest more directly that international education will be central to an enhanced multilateralism which may follow the pandemic and will be an imperative if we are to serve the discovery, innovation and learning foundations of our post-secondary institutions. The perspective from Canada and the UK is encouraging C and especially if more globalist perspectives prevail under the Biden administration in the US.","output":"International education: post-pandemic imperatives for Canada and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insensitivity to pain, inability to sweat and intellectual disability. CIPA is caused by mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1) that encodes the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF). CASE PRESENTATION Here, we present clinical and molecular findings in a 9-year-old girl with CIPA. The high-altitude indigenous Ecuadorian patient presented several health problems such as anhidrosis, bone fractures, self-mutilation, osteochondroma, intellectual disability and Riga-Fede disease. After the mutational analysis of NTRK1, the patient showed a clearly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with the pathogenic mutation rs763758904 (Arg602*) and the second missense mutation rs80356677 (Asp674Tyr). Additionally, the genomic analysis showed 69 pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants in 46 genes possibly related to phenotypic heterogeneity, including the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed 28 mutated genes involved in several biological processes. As a novel contribution, the protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that NTRK1, SPTBN2 and GRM6 interact with several proteins of the pain matrix involved in the response to stimulus and nervous system development. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study that associates clinical, genomics and networking analyses in a Native American patient with consanguinity background in order to better understand CIPA pathogenesis.","output":"Clinical, genomics and networking analyses of a high-altitude native American Ecuadorian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis: a case report."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/3.md","filePath":"doctor/3.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/3.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
