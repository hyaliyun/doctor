In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many countries responded aggressively and decisively with lockdown measures and border closures. Such actions may have helped prevent large outbreaks throughout much of the region, though there is substantial variation in caseloads and mortality between nations. Additionally, the health system infrastructure remains a concern throughout much of SSA, and the lockdown measures threaten to increase poverty and food insecurity for the subcontinents poorest residents. The lack of sufficient testing, asymptomatic infections, and poor reporting practices in many countries limit our understanding of the viruss impact, creating a need for better and more accurate surveillance metrics that account for underreporting and data contamination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to improve infectious disease surveillance by complementing standardized metrics with new and decomposable surveillance metrics of COVID-19 that overcome data limitations and contamination inherent in public health surveillance systems. In addition to prevalence of observed daily and cumulative testing, testing positivity rates, morbidity, and mortality, we derived COVID-19 transmission in terms of speed, acceleration or deceleration, change in acceleration or deceleration (jerk), and 7-day transmission rate persistence, which explains where and how rapidly COVID-19 is transmitting and quantifies shifts in the rate of acceleration or deceleration to inform policies to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 and food insecurity in SSA. METHODS: We extracted 60 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries and employed an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers in 47 sub-Saharan countries as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa have the most observed cases of COVID-19, and the Seychelles, Eritrea, Mauritius, Comoros, and Burundi have the fewest. In contrast, the speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence indicate rates of COVID-19 transmissions differ from observed cases. In September 2020, Cape Verde, Namibia, Eswatini, and South Africa had the highest speed of COVID-19 transmissions at 13.1, 7.1, 3.6, and 3 infections per 100,0000, respectively; Zimbabwe had an acceleration rate of transmission, while Zambia had the largest rate of deceleration this week compared to last week, referred to as a jerk. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate indicates the number of cases on September 15, 2020, which are a function of new infections from September 8, 2020, decreased in South Africa from 216.7 to 173.2 and Ethiopia from 136.7 to 106.3 per 100,000. The statistical approach was validated based on the regression results; they determined recent changes in the pattern of infection, and during the weeks of September 1-8 and September 9-15, there were substantial country differences in the evolution of the SSA pandemic. This change represents a decrease in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a de-escalation in the pandemic for the sub-Saharan African continent in general. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance metrics such as daily observed new COVID-19 cases or deaths are necessary but insufficient to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 transmission. Public health leaders also need to know where COVID-19 transmission rates are accelerating or decelerating, whether those rates increase or decrease over short time frames because the pandemic can quickly escalate, and how many cases today are a function of new infections 7 days ago. Even though SSA is home to some of the poorest countries in the world, development and population size are not necessarily predictive of COVID-19 transmission, meaning higher income countries like the United States can learn from African countries on how best to implement mitigation and prevention efforts.

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection. Author summaryThe immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection activates dendritic cells via cytosolic receptors rather than extracellular TLRs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social networking services played a crucial role in the management of previous outbreaks around the world.

It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway.

METHODS: The active ingredients and related targets of SMB were obtained through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, and CI-related targets were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. The target of SMB for the treatment of CI was obtained using Cytoscape software and visualized. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis was performed based on clusterProfiler within R, and the prediction results were validated by molecular docking technique. RESULTS: By constructing a compound-target (C-T) network, it was found that the active components in SMB mainly treated CI by regulating key proteins such as AKT1, IL-6, and EGFR. These key proteins mainly involve in pathways such as immune regulation, cancer and lipid metabolism, such as lipid and atherosclerosis, chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation pathways, and IL-17 signaling pathway. In the GO term, it mainly regulates the response to steroid hormones, membrane rafts, and G protein-amine receptor coupled activity. Eventually, we verified that the luteolin and tanshinone IIA components in SMB have a good possibility of action with AKT1 and IL-6 by in silico techniques, indicating that SMB has some scientificity in the treatment of CI. CONCLUSION: SMB mainly treats CI by regulating 94 proteins involved in lipid and atherosclerosis, chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Our research strategy provided a template for the drug development of TCM for the treatment of CI.","output":"Molecular Mechanism of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in Treating Cerebral Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity for academic libraries to advance open access (OA) to scholarly articles.

Little attention has been given to anxiety disorders by the medical community in Saudi Arabia. This study was carried out to screen for GAD among adults and determine the correlation of anxiety disorder with other comorbidities. METHODOLOGY: This study was a cross-sectional observational study carried out among adults aged 18 years and above in the general population in Saudi Arabia. The people were screened by using an Arabic validated version of General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire that was sent as a Google link via emails or different social media (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram groups) of the general population. The study was approved by the hospital research committee and the Institutional Review Board (HlRI-05-Apr21-01). RESULTS: We collected 338 participants in response to our questionnaire where 60.7% of them were females and 54.5% were aged between 25 and 34 years old. hypersensitivity, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) were the main medical conditions represented by 7.6%, 4.8%, 3.7%, and 3.4%. According to GAD-7 questionnaire, prevalence of any degree of anxiety was 62.1% where 33.1% of the total sample had mild anxiety, 15.7% had a moderate degree of anxiety and 13.3% had severe anxiety. Anxiety was related to age, residency, occupation, and some medical conditions. CONCLUSION: We found high prevalence of anxiety among our population which was the highest among younger participants, and students.

Given the uncertainty regarding the severity and time-path of the infections and related conditions, we examine three scenarios, ranging from a relatively moderate event to a disaster. The study considers a comprehensive list of causal factors affecting the impacts, including: mandatory closures and the gradual re-opening process; decline in workforce due to morbidity, mortality and avoidance behavior; increased demand for health care; decreased demand for public transportation and leisure activities; potential resilience through telework; increased demand for communication services; and increased pent-up demand. We apply a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, a state-of-the-art economy-wide modeling technique. It traces the broader economic ramifications of individual responses of producers and consumers through supply chains both within and across countries. We project that the net U.S. GDP losses from COVID-19 would range from $3.2 trillion (14.8%) to $4.8 trillion (23.0%) in a 2-year period for the three scenarios. U.S. impacts are estimated to be higher than those for China and the ROW in percentage terms. The major factor affecting the results in all three scenarios is the combination of Mandatory Closures and Partial Reopenings of businesses. These alone would have resulted in a 22.3% to 60.6% decrease in U.S. GDP across the scenarios. Pent-up Demand, generated from the inability to spend during the Closures/Reopenings, is the second most influential factor, significantly offsetting the overall negative impacts.","output":"The Impacts of the Coronavirus on the Economy of the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: investigar a capacidade institucional para o cuidado s pessoas com doen?as cr?nicas n?o transmissveis na ateno primria  sade.

This study examines whether there is a causal relationship (and, if so, in which direction) between people's well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Two hundred and twenty-two participants (54.50% female, M age = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of subjective well-being (SWB) and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that people's SWB and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak (T1), decline (T2), and trough stages (T3) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants' SWB at T0 (pre-pandemic stage; the base level of SWB) and T1 could significantly predict their COVID-19 anxiety at T1 and T2 respectively. However, SWB at T2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at T3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent SWB from T1 to T3. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety through the development of epidemics, as well as finding ways to alleviate people's COVID-19 anxiety.

Here, we leverage the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource to better understand how chronic infection by Theilers Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) elicits diverse clinical and morphologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS). We characterized the TMEV-induced clinical phenotype responses, and associated lesion distributions in the CNS, in six CC mouse strains over a 90 day infection period. We observed varying degrees of motor impairment in these strains, as measured by delayed righting reflex, paresis, paralysis, seizures, limb clasping, ruffling, and encephalitis phenotypes. All strains developed neuroparenchymal necrosis and mineralization in the brain, primarily localized to the hippocampal regions. Two of the six strains presented with axonal degeneration with myelin loss of the nerve roots in the lumbar spinal cord. Moreover, we statistically correlated lesion distribution with overall frequencies of clinical phenotypes and phenotype progression to better understand how and where TMEV targets the CNS, based on genetic background. Specifically, we assessed lesion distribution in relation to the clinical progression of these phenotypes from early to late TMEV disease, finding significant relationships between progression and lesion distribution. Finally, we identified quantitative trait loci associated with frequency of lesions in a particular brain region, revealing several loci of interest for future study: lysosomal trafficking regulator (Lyst) and nidogen 1 (Nid1). Together, these results indicate that the genetic background influences the type and severity of clinical phenotypes, phenotypic resilience to TMEV, and the lesion distribution across strains.","output":"Host genetic diversity drives variable central nervous system lesion distribution in chronic phase of Theilers Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The control of spreading of COVID-19 in emergency situation the entire world is a challenge, and therefore, the aim of this study was to propose a spherical intelligent fuzzy decision model for control and diagnosis of COVID-19 The emergency event is known to have aspects of short time and data, harmfulness, and ambiguity, and policy makers are often rationally bounded under uncertainty and threat There are some classic approaches for representing and explaining the complexity and vagueness of the information The effective tool to describe and reduce the uncertainty in data information is fuzzy set and their extension Therefore, we used fuzzy logic to develop fuzzy mathematical model for control of transmission and spreading of COVID19 The fuzzy control of early transmission and spreading of coronavirus by fuzzy mathematical model will be very effective The proposed research work is on fuzzy mathematical model of intelligent decision systems under the spherical fuzzy information In the proposed work, we will develop a newly and generalized technique for COVID19 based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) methods under spherical fuzzy environment Finally, an illustrative the emergency situation of COVID-19 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested method, along with a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, showing the feasibility and reliability of its results","output":"A new emergency response of spherical intelligent fuzzy decision process to diagnose of COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of viral RNA through PCR. Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Methods: We devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. Findings: Our model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712-0.759), auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119-0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently-collected symptom survey dataset from the U.S., U.K. and Sweden.Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups. Conclusions: our tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified.

More than 2,200 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in humans from 27 countries, with a crude case fatality rate of 35% since the disease's emergence in the Middle East in 2012. In the coming years, MERS will continue to pose a severe threat to economic development as well as to the elimination of poverty and advances in food security. An important gap in the effort to keep MERS at bay is the lack of surveillance of animals in the Middle East. The authors identify the need for international collaboration to conduct MERS coronavirus (CoV) surveillance in animals in the Middle East, since the emergence of new MERS-CoV variants with the ability to sustain efficient person-to-person transmission is a genuine threat. However, effective surveillance will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. There are multiple obstacles in the region to overcome, including a lack of transparency as governments in the Middle East generally do not disclose detailed information on animal diseases. In addition, there is minimal collaboration between local and international agencies in both the human and animal health sectors and a limited number of readily available qualified laboratories to screen animals for MERS- CoV. Last, but not least, there is a lack of adequate active communication between all relevant laboratories, local and abroad. However, with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and other partners, the responsibility of the Mediterranean Zoonosis Control Centre in Athens, Greece, could be widened to include the countries of the Middle East.

Early identification of COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) helps to improve the outcomes. We aim to investigate whether absolute eosinophil count (AEC) can predict ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards. Methods: A retrospective study of 94 elderly patients older than 60 years old with COVID-19 was conducted. We compared the basic clinical characteristics and levels of inflammation markers on admission to general isolation wards and the needs for ICU transfer between the eosinopenia (AEC on admission <20 cells/l) and non-eosinopenia (AEC 20 cells/l) groups. Results: There was a significantly higher ICU transfer rate in the eosinopenia group than in the non-eosinopenia group (51 vs. 9%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that eosinopenia was associated with an increased risk of ICU transfer in elderly COVID-19 patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.12 (95% CI, 1.23C30.33), P = 0.027] after adjustment of age, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin levels. The eosinopenia group had higher levels of CRP, ferritin, and cytokines [interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)] than the non-eosinophil group (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of AEC on admission for predicting ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients was 0.828 (95% CI, 0.732C0.923). The best cut-off value of AEC was 25 cells/l with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%, respectively. Conclusion: Absolute eosinophil count on admission is a valid predictive marker for ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards and, therefore, can help case triage and optimize ICU utilization, especially for health care facilities with limited ICU capacity.","output":"Absolute Eosinophil Count Predicts Intensive Care Unit Transfer Among Elderly COVID-19 Patients From General Isolation Wards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neolentinus lepideus is a fungus consumed by rural communities in Central America and Asia due to its rich flavor; however, little information on its chemical composition is available.

Ground-level equivalent BC (eBC) measurements were performed between January 2020 and July 2020 at a university campus located in Dammam city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The fossil fuel (eBC(ff)) and biomass burning (eBC(bb)) fractions of total eBC (eBC(t)) concentrations were estimated as 84% and 16%, respectively, during the entire study period. The mean eBC(bb), eBC(ff), and eBC(t) concentrations during the lockdown reduced by 14%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. The results of statistical analyses indicated that local fossil fuel burning emissions and atmospheric conditions apparently affected the observed eBC levels. Long-range potential source locations, including Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, distributed zones in the Arabian Gulf, and United Arab Emirates and regional source areas, such as the Arabian Gulf coastline of the KSA, Bahrain, and Qatar, were associated with moderate to high concentrations observed at the receptor site as a result of cluster analysis and concentration-weighted trajectory analysis methods.","output":"Source Apportionment of Ambient Black Carbon during the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impact mental health worldwide. High prevalence of stress had been previously reported in populations during this context. Many theoretical frameworks had been proposed for explaining the stress process, we aim to proposed and explanatory model for the genesis of perceived stress in Peruvian general population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey in Peruvian general population assessing sociodemographic variables and evaluating mental health conditions by using The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and a numerical rating scale (NRS) for fear of COVID-19. Correlation analysis was conducted for the variables of interest. Two regression models were constructed to explore related factor to the dimensions of perceived stress. Finally, a structural regression model was performed with the independent variables. RESULTS: Data of 210 individuals was analyzed. Ages ranged from 15 to 74 years and 39% were women. Additionally, 65.2% of the participants had at least one mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms). Perceived self-efficacy and positive affect (PA) were correlated, as perceived helplessness with anxious symptoms and negative affect (NA). Regression analysis showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, and NA explained perceived helplessness while positive and NA explained self-efficacy. The structural regression model analysis identified that fear of COVID-19 (composed of fear of infecting others and fear of contagion), predicted mental health conditions (i.e., depressive or anxiety symptoms); also, mental health conditions were predicted by PA and NA. Perceived helplessness and Perceived self-efficacy were interrelated and represented the perceived stress variable. CONCLUSION: We proposed an explanatory model of perceived stress based on two correlated dimensions (self-efficacy and helplessness) in the Peruvian general population during the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with two out of three individuals surveyed having at least one mental health condition.","output":"Explanatory Model of Perceived Stress in the General Population: A Cross-Sectional Study in Peru During the COVID-19 Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Clinical reasoning is a complex task which is generally acquired through years of experience. Learning by concordance (LbC) is an educational reflective tool that fosters clinical decision-making in complex situations. It is widely used and validated in medical education, but is new to dentistry. This presentation aims to familiarize oral pathology educators with LbC, the construction of a LbC activity, and its possible applications in dental education. Materials and Methods LbC activities were created and implemented in the undergraduate oral pathology curriculum at Universit de Montral. The principles behind LbC are presented, as well as the steps required to create a LbC activity, and the possible applications in oral pathology training. Student feedback is also presented. Results In a LbC activity, the student is presented a variety of clinical scenarios requiring them to interpret incoming information and make decisions. It focusses on the many micro-decisions that a clinician makes throughout a clinical exam in order to provide a diagnosis or institute treatment. After answering a question, the student receives immediate feedback from a panel of chosen experts, allowing the student to assess if there is concordance. Through online applications and educational plaforms, LbC is now accessible to dental educators. Conclusions LbC is a simple, low-cost and efficient way to help students reinforce their clinical reasoning skills and auto-evaluate their understanding by comparing their reasoning to that of experts located worldwide. It can also provide valuable assessment of what students think and how they reason. In addition to clinical reasoning, it can be used to teach and assess professionalism. Its online applicability provides new teaching opportunities in undergraduate, graduate and continued dental education, especially in the new context provided by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Learning by concordance C a new tool for developing clinical reasoning in oral pathology and dental education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation for migraine prevention. METHODS After completing a 4-week diary run-in period, adults who had migraine with or without aura were randomly assigned to receive active non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation or sham therapy during a 12-week double-blind period. RESULTS Of 336 enrolled participants, 113 (active, n = 56; sham, n = 57) completed 70 days of the double-blind period and were 66% adherent with treatment, comprising the prespecified modified intention-to-treat population. The COVID-19 pandemic led to early trial termination, and the population was 60% smaller than the statistical target for full power. Mean reduction in monthly migraine days (primary endpoint) was 3.12 for the active group and 2.29 days for the sham group (difference, -0.83; p = 0.2329). Responder rate (i.e. the percentage of participants with a 50% reduction in migraine days) was greater in the active group (44.87%) than the sham group (26.81%; p = 0.0481). Prespecified subgroup analysis suggested that participants with aura responded preferentially. No serious device-related adverse events were reported.

Based on the subject definition, the subject data were extracted from the National Health Insurance healthcare facility database and qualification database. We collected medical use details included in the research database, general medical examination results, medical history included in the health examination database, and additional data on the cause of death from the National Statistics database to analyze the main cause of death and mortality. RESULTS: In terms of the major causes of death and mortality among healthcare workers, the mortality rate associated with intentional self-harm, injury, transportation accident, heart disease, addiction, and falling was significantly higher than that in the general population. Further, the prevalence of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases was high. When analyzing the proportional mortality ratio (PMR) by cause of death for healthcare workers, the PMR values for death related to malignant neoplasm was the highest. In terms of diseases, both doctors and nurses had higher rates of infectious diseases such as maternal sepsis, rubella, and measles.

The role of oxidative stress in exacerbating manifestations in COVID-19 pathogenesis is under-reported.This study aimed touseserum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD3) and glutathione-S-transferase (GSTp1) by ELISA, zinc (ErbaChem5), ferritin and free iron (VitrosChemistry, Ortho Clinical Diagnosis, Raritan, NJ, USA) at the first encounter of randomly selected RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, for assessing disease severity. The parameters which helped in identifying the severity, leading to poor prognosis, were neutrophil:lymphocyte higher than 4, high CRP, low SOD3 values and high GSTp1 values, and diabetes mellitus as a co-morbidity. Higher zinc levels correlated with high GSTp1 and low SOD3, indicating the protective effect of zinc on ROS. The increased high GSTp1 shows an anticipated protective biochemical response, to mitigate the low SOD3 values due to ROS consumption. Decreased SOD3 levels indicate a state of high oxidative stress at cellular levels, and an anticipated increase in GSTp1 levels points to the pathophysiological bases of increasing severity with age, sex, and co-morbidities, such asdiabetes.

METHODS: All patients from the ages of 0 to 18 years visiting the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Research and Training Hospital, paediatric emergency service from April-October 2019 to April-October 2020 with no missing information in their records were involved in this retrospective cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The total number of paediatric emergency service consultations was 74 739; the number of emergency visits from April to October 2019 was 55 678, whereas it was 19 061 from April to October 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic period. There was a 67.7% decrease in consultations during the pandemic period. The mean age of participants from April to October 2019 was 8.11  5.31 years, and 52.4% of cases were male. The mean age from April to October 2020 was 8.58  5.93 years, and 51% of cases were male. COVID-19-related symptoms were higher during the pandemic period (P < .05), with fever and gastroenteritis being the most frequently received diagnosis in both periods. During the pandemic period, the newborn consultation ratio was higher (P > .05), there was a decrease in consultation ratios related to suicide attempts (P < .05), and a threefold increase in death rates was observed (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In Turkey, where emergency consultation rates are quite high, these decreases look fearsome for secondary injuries that can develop in children.

Because of the large number of cultivars, it is necessary to prioritize extracts before proceeding to clinical trials. Purpose: To compare extracts of two unique cannabis cultivars (CT-921, CT-928) for treatment of neuropathic pain induced by constriction of sciatic nerve in mice and to illustrate the use of this animal model to set priority for future trials. Methods: Pain severity was measured by threshold force causing paw withdrawal. Dose-response relationships and time course were determined for intravenously injected extracts of cultivars and vehicle. The doses for allodynia relief were correlated with decreased respiratory rate, temperature and behavioral changes. Results: Effective analgesic dose for 50 and 95% (ED50An and ED95An) was 15, and 29 mg/kg for CT-921 and 0.9 and 4.7 for CT-928. At ED50An, for both extracts, the duration was 120 min. At ED95An, administration of CT-928 significantly decreased respiratory rate while CT-921 did not. CT-928 decreased temperature more than CT-921. CT-928 produced frantic hyperactivity not seen with CT-921. At equivalent analgesic doses, THC was much less in CT-921 than in CT-928 suggesting interactions with components other than THC influenced the analgesia. At equivalent analgesic doses, efficacy-to-adverse effect profile for CT-928 was worse than for CT-921. Conclusion: Both extracts relieved neuropathic pain; however, CT-921 had a better efficacy-to-adverse effect profile, a rational basis for prioritizing cultivars for future clinical evaluation.","output":"Cannabis Extract CT-921 Has a High Efficacy-Adverse Effect Profile in a Neuropathic Pain Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 and related efforts to mitigate its spread have dramatically transformed the structure and predictability of modern childhood, resulting in growing concerns children may be particularly vulnerable to serious mental health consequences.

Previous studies have compared case rates over set phases. There has been no analysis of how inequalities in cases changed overtime and were shaped by national mitigation strategies (e.g. lock downs). This paper provides the first analysis of the evolution of area-level inequalities in COVID-19 cases by deprivation levels in the first wave of the pandemic (January to July 2020) in England C with a focus on the effects of the first national lockdown (March C July 2020). Methods: Weekly case rates per Middle Super Output Area (MSOA, n=4412) in England from 2020-03-15 to 2020-07-04 were obtained, and characteristics of local epidemics were calculated, e.g. the highest case rate per area. Simple linear and logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the association of these metrics with index of multiple deprivation (IMD). Local authority-level (n=309) cases were used similarly in a sensitivity analysis, as these data were available daily and extended further back in time. The impact of lockdown was assessed by comparing the cumulative case rate in the most deprived 20% of MSOAs to the least deprived 20%, for the periods before the lockdown, and by the end of lockdown. Findings: Less deprived areas began recording COVID-19 cases earlier than more deprived areas and were more likely to have peaked by March 2020. More deprived areas case rates grew faster and peaked higher than less deprived areas. During the first national lockdown in the UK, the relative excess in case rates in the most deprived areas increased to 130% of that of the least deprived ones. Interpretation: The pattern of disease spread in England confirm the hypothesis that initial cases of a novel infectious disease are likely to occur in more affluent communities, but more deprived areas will overtake them once national mitigation strategies begin, and bear the brunt of the total case load. The strict first national lockdown served to increase case rate inequalities in England.","output":"The Effects of the First National Lockdown in England on Geographical Inequalities in the Evolution of COVID-19 Case Rates: An Ecological Study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to reveal and investigate mothers experiences of students with severe disabilities regarding learning in distance education in Lima-Peru.

The clinical course, outcomes, and significance of immunosuppression regimen in heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We included the first 99 heart transplant recipients at participating centers with COVID-19 and followed patients until resolution. We collected baseline information, symptoms, laboratory studies, vital signs, and outcomes for included patients. The association of immunosuppression regimens at baseline with severe disease were compared using logistic regression, adjusting for age and time since transplant. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years, 25% were female, and 44% were white. The median time post-transplant to infection was 5.6 years. Overall, 15% died, 64% required hospital admission, and 7% remained asymptomatic. During the course of illness, only 57% of patients had a fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms were common. Tachypnea, oxygen requirement, elevated creatinine and inflammatory markers were predictive of severe course. Age &#8805; 60 was associated with higher risk of death and the use of the combination of calcineurin inhibitor, antimetabolite, and prednisone was associated with more severe disease compared to the combination of calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite alone (adjusted OR = 7.3, 95% CI 1.8-36.2).

A validated algorithm was used to identify MS cases over the period 2011-2018. The numbers of specialist and home-based services were compared between 2019 and 2020. The medication possession ratio was used to measure adherence to DMTs. RESULTS: A total of 9380 MS patients were identified (68% women). A decline in the number of outpatient care services between March and June 2020 compared to the previous year was observed, in particular for rehabilitation (-82%), magnetic resonance imaging (-56%) and neurological specialist services (-91%). Important year-to-year variations were observed in May and June 2020 in home-based nursing and medical care (-91%) and motor re-education services (-74%).

In acute ischemic stroke treatment, the efficacy and safety of emergent carotid artery stenting (eCAS) for hyperacute ischemic stroke (hAIS) due to internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) have not been sufficiently established. Case Description A 71-year-old man with hAIS caused by severe ICS was treated via intravenous alteplase infusion. The patient underwent screening for COVID-19 by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay shortly after arrival at our institution. The LAMP result was obtained within 90 minutes, during intravenous alteplase infusion, and turned out to be negative. The symptom of hemiplegia worsened during alteplase infusion, and he, therefore, underwent eCAS after administration of aspirin (200 mg). Recanalization was achieved successfully by eCAS, and dual antiplatelet therapy and argatroban were administrated following eCAS. Hemorrhagic complications or re-stenosis/occlusion of the carotid artery were not observed. He was discharged without neurological deficits 15 days following eCAS. Because of the rapid negative diagnosis for COVID-19 using the LAMP method, eCAS could be performed following standard procedures, along with infectious defense, without delay. Conclusions This case report suggests that eCAS for hAIS due to ICS following intravenous alteplase can be an effective treatment, along with appropriate antiplatelet medication and management in select patients.

To compare the surgical results and patient satisfaction between 5-port LRYGB and the novel SITU-LRYGB at a university hospital. METHODS We performed 5-port or SITU-LRYGB on 140 morbidly obese patients; the patients chose the operation method. We used a novel liver traction method and omega-umbilicoplasty specifically designed for SITU-LRYGB. RESULTS Before surgery, the patients in the 5-port surgery group were more obese than those in the SITU group (120.8 kg versus 108.9 kg, P = .013). The rate of hypertension was also greater in the former group. The operative time was longer for SITU-LRYGB (101.1 versus 81.1 min, P = .001) without increased intraoperative complications. The total morphine dose for the SITU group seemed to be greater but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference in complications was observed.

Novel approaches to extend treatment capacity include telemedicine (TM) and mobile treatment on demand; however, their combined use has not been reported or evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a TM mobile treatment unit (TM-MTU) to improve access to MOUD for individuals living in an underserved rural area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study evaluated data collected from adult outpatients with a diagnosis of OUD enrolled in the TM-MTU initiative from February 2019 (program inception) to June 2020. Program staff traveled to rural areas in a modified recreational vehicle equipped with medical, videoconferencing, and data collection devices. Patients were virtually connected with physicians based more than 70 miles (112 km) away. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020.

In addition, compared with the nearest brick-and-mortar treatment location, TM-MTU treatment was a mean of 6.52 miles (range, 0.10-58.70 miles) (10.43 km; range, 0.16-93.92 km) and a mean of 10 minutes (range, 1-49 minutes) closer for patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data demonstrate the feasibility of combining TM with mobile treatment, with outcomes (retention and opioid use) similar to those obtained from office-based TM MOUD programs. By implementing a traveling virtual platform, this clinical paradigm not only helps fill the void of rural MOUD practitioners but also facilitates access to underserved populations who are less likely to reach traditional medical settings, with critical relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mobile Telemedicine for Buprenorphine Treatment in Rural Populations With Opioid Use Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first registered cases of cutaneous adverse reactions in North-East Italy after the m-RNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty?-BioNTech/Pfizer, During January 2021, in the public health jurisdiction of Trieste, a total of 19,485 individuals have been vaccinated: 13,266 (68.08%) first doses and 6,219 (31.92%) completed cycles of two doses.

Following a mean field approach that models individuals like molecules in a well-mixed solution, I derive a modified SIR model in which the average daily contacts between susceptible and infected population are reduced based on the known infection levels, capturing the effects of social distancing policies. This approach yields a time-varying reproduction number that is continuously adjusted based on infection information through a negative-feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in ecology and Hill functions in chemistry and molecular biology. This feedback-adjustment of the transmission rate causes a structural reduction in infection peak, and simulations indicate that such reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. Simulations also show that a distancing policy based on infection data may substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. If the distancing rate is linearly proportional to infections, this model adds a single parameter to the original SIR, making it useful to illustrate the effects of social distancing enforced based on awareness of infections.","output":"A feedback SIR (fSIR) model highlights advantages and limitations of infection-based social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the methodological quality of intervention-focused systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) published in high-impact otolaryngology journals. DATA SOURCES Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS A comprehensive search was performed for SR and MA citations from 2012 to 2017 in the 10 highest impact factor otolaryngology journals. Abstracts were screened to identify published manuscripts in which the authors indicated clearly that they were performing an SR or MA. Applying a modified typology of reviews, 4 reviewers characterized the review type as SR, MA, or another review type. A simplified version of the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2) tool was used to assess the reporting and methodological quality of the SRs and MAs that were focused on interventions. RESULTS Search and abstract screening generated 499 manuscripts that identified themselves as performing an SR or MA. A substantial number (85/499, 17%) were review types other than SRs or MAs, including 34 (7%) that were literature reviews. In total, 236 SRs and MAs focused on interventions. Over 50% of these SRs and MAs had weaknesses in at least 3 of the 16 items in the AMSTAR 2, and over 40% had weaknesses in at least 2 of the 7 critical domains. Ninety-nine percent of SRs and MAs provided critically low confidence in the results of the reviews.

The aim was to evaluate work participation up to 10 years after colon or rectal cancer diagnosis compared between diagnosis and to a matched cancer-free population. METHODS In this national register-based cohort study, all first-time CRC patients in the period 2000-2015 with no previous cancer, between 20 and 60 years, were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry. A control group with no previous cancer was matched on gender, age, education, and income. For each year a mean Work Participation Score (WPS) was calculated (a percentage of weeks working) for individuals part of the labour market. RESULTS A total of 5625 colon cancer patients and 3856 rectal cancer patients and 25,341 and 17,256 matched controls were included in the study, respectively. The WPS increased for colon cancer patients from 45.69% after 1 year to 83.94% after 4 years, while rectal cancer patients had a score of 38.07% after 1 year and 80.07% after 4 years. The WPS was lower for cancer patients compared with controls, but the difference decreased after 4 years. CONCLUSION CRC patients had a lower work participation up to 10 years after diagnosis compared with controls, while rectal cancer patients had a lower participation the first 7 years after diagnosis compared with colon cancer patients.

To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey among health workers and laypersons from July to November 2018. We investigated the following information about SRH self-care interventions: knowledge and uptake; decisions for use; and associations between health workers uptake and providing prescriptions, referrals, and/or information for these interventions. Participants (n = 837) included laypersons (n = 477) and health workers (n = 360) from 112 countries, with most representation from the WHO European Region (29.2%), followed by the Americas (28.4%) and African (23.2%) Regions.

The outcome analyzed was intention to leave their programs. There were 4 self-reported predictors: anxiety, burnout, depression, and COVID-19 impact on overall mental health. The authors ran multiple variable logistic regression models to evaluate relationships between each predictor and outcome (&#945; = .05) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 35.5%. Overall, 12.7% of participants reported any intention to leave. In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health.

With high Interleukin -6 (IL-6) levels reported in COVID-19 related deaths in China, IL-6 is considered to be the key player in COVID-19 cytokine storm. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, is used on compassionate grounds for treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm. The aim of this study was to assess effect of tocilizumab on mortality due to COVID-19 cytokine storm. METHOD: This retrospective, observational study included patients of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent hypoxia (defined as saturation 94% or less on supplemental Oxygen of 15 L per minute through non-rebreathing mask or PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200) who were admitted to a tertiary care center in Mumbai, India, between 31st March to 5th July 2020. In addition to standard care, single Inj. Tocilizumab 400 mg was given intravenously to 151 consecutive COVID-19 patients with persistent hypoxia, from 13th May to 5th July 2020. These 151 patients were retrospectively analysed and compared with historic controls, ie consecutive COVID-19 patients with persistent hypoxia, defined as stated above (N = 118, from our first COVID-19 admission on 31st March to 12th May 2020 i.e., till tocilizumab was available in hospital). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed for identifying predictors of survival. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 26. RESULTS: Out of 269 (151 in tocilizumab group and 118 historic controls) patients studied from 31st March to 5th July 2020, median survival in the tocilizumab group was significantly longer than in the control group; 18 days (95% CI, 11.3 to 24.7) versus 9 days (95% CI, 5.7 to 12.3); log rank p 0.007. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, independent predictors of survival were use of tocilizumab (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.427C0.903, P 0.013) and higher oxygen saturation. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab may improve survival in severe COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent hypoxia.

METHODS: Included all patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography during hospitalization. Echocardiographic characteristics were assessed in the entire population and subgroups. We also analyzed clinical characteristics associated with an abnormal echocardiogram. An echocardiogram was defined as abnormal when it demonstrates systolic ventricular dysfunction of any degree (left and/or right ventricle) and/or high filling pressures (E/E' ratio>16; SPAP>40mmHg, RAP>15mmHg or diastolic dysfunction  grade 2) and/or moderate to severe pericardial effusion. Clinical variables were also assessed using a classification tree and binary logistic regression was performed with characteristics that showed a statistical significance in univariate analysis. Finally, echocardiographic variables were assessed for in-hospital mortality outcome using the chi-square test. RESULTS: 272 admissions to ICU by COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 159 underwent echocardiography (58.5%). 39 were excluded by incomplete demographic data. 72 echocardiograms (60%) were abnormal according to pre-established criteria. Low occurrence of left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed, as well as 30.8% of the population had a normal diastolic function. In univariate analysis, characteristics associated with abnormal echocardiogram were age, elevated troponin, previous heart failure, and SAPS3 score. In the regression model, troponin was the independent marker of abnormal echocardiography in patients admitted to the intensive care unit by COVID19. This finding was corroborated by the classification tree. The abnormal echocardiogram was not associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.60; CI95% 0.75C3.41), but the presence of systolic ventricular dysfunction of any degree was associated with a higher occurrence of this outcome (OR 3.52; CI95% 1.12C11.1). CONCLUSIONS: In intensive care COVID-19 patients, many manifested elevated ventricular filling pressures, but the occurrence of ventricular dysfunction was low. Elevated serum troponin level was the independent marker associated with an abnormal echocardiogram.

We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great.

In our analysis, we distinguish two types of lie detection technology, accurate truth metering and accurate thought exposing. We generally find that truth metering is already largely within the scope of existing US federal and state laws, albeit with some notable exceptions. In contrast, we find that current regulation of thought exposing technologies is ambiguous and inadequate to safeguard civil liberties.

Medical schools in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have limited capacity to develop resources in the face of rapidly developing health emergencies. Here, a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed as a COVID-19 resource for medical students working in these settings, and its effectiveness was evaluated. METHODS: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of MOOC in teaching medical students about COVID-19. The data sources included the student registration forms, metrics quantifying their interactions within the modules, students' course feedback, and free-text responses. The data were collected from the Moodle learning management system and Google analytics from May 9 to September 15, 2020. The research team analyzed the quantitative data descriptively and the qualitative data thematically. RESULTS: Among the 16,237 unique visitors who accessed the course, only 6031 medical students from 71 medical schools registered, and about 4993 (83% of registrants) completed the course, indicating high levels of satisfaction (M = 8.17, SD = 1.49) on a 10-point scale.

Key recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic include providing up-to-date, health literate, concise information about preventing COVID-19 and accessing care including telehealth. SUMMARY: Enhancing advocacy and engagement for transplant patients and donors along the pre-to-post transplant/donation continuum can improve clinical outcomes and quality of life generally, and more so, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Amplifying the Patient Voice: Key Priorities and Opportunities for Improved Transplant and Living Donor Advocacy and Outcomes During COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the need for developing effective respiratory support that can be rapidly implemented during critical surge capacity scenarios in healthcare settings. Lung support with bubble continuous positive airway pressure (B-CPAP) is a well-established therapeutic approach for supporting neonatal patients. However, the effectiveness of B-CPAP in larger pediatric and adult patients has not been addressed. Using similar principles of B-CPAP pressure generation, application of intermittent positive pressure inflations above CPAP could support gas exchange and high work of breathing levels in larger patients experiencing more severe forms of respiratory failure. This report describes the design and performance characteristics of the BubbleVent, a novel 3D-printed valve system that combined with commonly found tubes, hoses, and connectors can provide intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) suitable for adult mechanical ventilation without direct electrification. Testing of the BubbleVent was performed on a passive adult test lung model and compared with a critical care ventilator commonly used in tertiary care centers. The BubbleVent was shown to deliver stable PIP and PEEP levels, as well as timing control of breath delivery that was comparable with a critical care ventilator.","output":"Performance Characteristics of a Novel 3D-Printed Bubble Intermittent Mandatory Ventilator (B-IMV) for Adult Pulmonary Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) airspace opacities is time consuming and challenging to quantify on computed tomography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a deep convolutional neural network (dCNN) to predict inpatient outcomes associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously trained dCNN was tested on an external validation cohort of 241 patients who presented to the emergency department and received a chest computed tomography scan, 93 with COVID-19 and 168 without. Airspace opacity scoring systems were defined by the extent of airspace opacity in each lobe, totaled across the entire lungs. Expert and dCNN scores were concurrently evaluated for interobserver agreement, while both dCNN identified airspace opacity scoring and raw opacity values were used in the prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and inpatient outcomes. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for airspace opacity scoring was 0.892 (95% CI 0.834-0.930). Probability of each outcome behaved as a logistic function of the opacity scoring (25% ICU admission at score of 13/25, 25% intubation at 17/25, and 25% mortality at 20/25). Length of hospitalization, ICU stay, and intubation were associated with larger airspace opacity score (p = 0.032, 0.039, 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The tested dCNN was highly predictive of inpatient outcomes, performs at a near expert level, and provides added value for clinicians in terms of prognostication and disease severity.","output":"An Interpretable Chest CT Deep Learning Algorithm for Quantification of COVID-19 Lung Disease and Prediction of Inpatient Morbidity and Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-immune kittens passively immunized with feline serum containing high-titered antibodies reactive with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) developed a more rapid disease after FIPV challenge than did kittens pretreated with FIPV antibody-negative serum.

Alpha-carbonic anhydrases (-CAs) have been identified as suitable sequestration agents. This study reports the sequence and structural analysis of 15 -CAs from bacteria, originating from hydrothermal vent systems. Structural analysis of the multimers enabled the identification of hotspot and interface residues. Molecular dynamics simulations of the homo-multimers were performed at 300 K, 363 K, 393 K and 423 K to unearth potentially thermostable -CAs. Average betweenness centrality (BC) calculations confirmed the relevance of some hotspot and interface residues. The key residues responsible for dimer thermostability were identified by comparing fluctuating interfaces with stable ones, and were part of conserved motifs. Crucial long-lived hydrogen bond networks were observed around residues with high BC values. Dynamic cross correlation fortified the relevance of oligomerization of these proteins, thus the importance of simulating them in their multimeric forms. A consensus of the simulation analyses used in this study suggested high thermostability for the -CA from Nitratiruptor tergarcus.

METHODS: We compare the immunogenicity and durability of these two vaccines among fully vaccinated Hong Kong people. FINDINGS: Standard BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccinations were tolerated and induced neutralizing antibody (NAb) (100% and 85.7%) and spike-specific CD4 T cell responses (96.7% and 82.1%), respectively. The geometric mean NAb IC(50) and median frequencies of reactive CD4 subsets were consistently lower among CoronaVac-vaccinees than BNT162b2-vaccinees. CoronaVac did not induce measurable levels of nucleocapsid protein-specific IFN-(+) CD4(+) T or IFN-(+) CD8(+) T cells compared with unvaccinated. Against VOCs, NAb response rates and geometric mean IC(50) titers against B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) were significantly lower for CoronaVac (50%, 23.2 and 7.1%, <20) than BNT162b2 (94.1%, 131 and 58.8%, 35.0), respectively. Three months after vaccinations, NAbs to VOCs dropped near to detection limit, along with waning memory T cell responses, mainly among CoronaVac-vaccinees.

METHODS: We measured IgA, IgG and IgM levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens from the wild-type and S from the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern, after BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination in a cohort of health care workers (N=578). Neutralizing capacity and antibody avidity were evaluated. Data were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 history, comorbidities, vaccine doses, brand and adverse events. FINDINGS: Vaccination induced robust IgA and IgG levels against all S antigens. Neutralization capacity and S IgA and IgG levels were higher in mRNA-1273 vaccinees, previously SARS-CoV-2 exposed, particularly if symptomatic, and in those experiencing systemic adverse effects (p<005). A second dose in pre-exposed did not increase antibody levels. Smoking and comorbidities were associated with 43% (95% CI, 19-59) and 45% (95% CI, 63-18) lower neutralization, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 3-57%) and 55% (95% CI, 33-70%) lower antibody levels, respectively. Among fully vaccinated, 63% breakthroughs were detected up to 189 days post-vaccination. Among pre-exposed non-vaccinated, 90% were IgG seropositive more than 300 days post-infection. INTERPRETATION: Our data support administering a single-dose in pre-exposed healthy individuals as primary vaccination. However, heterogeneity of responses suggests that personalized recommendations may be necessary depending on COVID-19 history and life-style. Higher mRNA-1273 immunogenicity would be beneficial for those expected to respond worse to vaccination and in face of variants that escape immunity such as Omicron. Persistence of antibody levels in pre-exposed unvaccinated indicates maintenance of immunity up to one year.

It is the main export commodity of several countries; thus, contributes towards foreign exchange earnings. Unfortunately, average global rice yield is far below than its genetic potential. Low nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) is among the major reasons for low average yield. Current study evaluated the impact of nitrogen fertilizer application methods (conventional and deep placement) on growth, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, agronomic N-use efficiency (ANUE), partial factors productivity of applied N (PFP) and economic returns of two different transplanted rice varieties (Basmati-515 and Super-Basmati). Fertilizer application methods significantly affected allometry, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns. Deep placement of N-fertilizer (DPNF) observed better allometric traits, high chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, yield attributes and economic returns compared to conventional application of N-fertilizer (CANF). Similarly, Basmati-515 had better allometric and yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns than Super-Basmati. Regarding interactions among N-fertilizer application methods and rice varieties, Basmati-515 with DPNF resulted in higher chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, allometric and yield related traits and economic returns than CANF. The lowest values of these traits were observed for Super-Basmati with no application of N-fertilizer. Both varieties had better yield and economic returns with DPNF compared to CANF. It is concluded that DPNF improved yield, ANUE and economic returns; therefore, should be opted to improve productivity of transplanted fine rice. Nonetheless, lower nitrogen doses need to be tested for DPNF to infer whether it could lower N use in rice crop.","output":"Deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer improves yield, nitrogen use efficiency and economic returns of transplanted fine rice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN Debate exists as to patient experience, and the importance, of the working alliance (WA) in videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP).

Complete RdRp, S, and N gene sequencing of the 41 HCoV-229E strains revealed that our contemporary HCoV-229E strains have undergone significant genetic drift with clustering of strains in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified, in addition to previously described genogroups 1 to 4, with recent circulating strains including strain HK20-42 belonging to novel genogroup 6. Positive selection was detected in the spike protein and receptor-binding domain, which may be important for viral evolution at the receptor-binding interphase. Molecular dating analysis showed that HCoV-229E shared the most recent common ancestor with bat and camel/alpaca 229E-related viruses at 1884, while camel/alpaca viruses had a relatively recent common ancestor at 1999. Further studies are required to ascertain the evolutionary origin and path of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in the 1960s, the genetic diversity and evolution of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) have been relatively understudied. In this study, we report a fatal case of COVID-19 coinfected with HCoV-229E in Hong Kong. Genome sequencing revealed that our SARS-CoV-2 strain is highly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan, compatible with the patients recent travel history, whereas our HCoV-229E strain in this study is highly identical to a recent strain in the United States. We also retrieved 41 archived HCoV-229E strains from 2004 to 2019 in Hong Kong for sequence analysis. Pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic airway diseases were common diagnoses among the 41 patients. The results showed that HCoV-229E was evolving in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified in addition to the four preexisting HCoV-229E genogroups, with recent circulating strains belonging to novel genogroup 6. Molecular clock analysis dated bat-to-human and bat-to-camelid transmission to as early as 1884.","output":"Molecular Evolution of Human Coronavirus 229E in Hong Kong and a Fatal COVID-19 Case Involving Coinfection with a Novel Human Coronavirus 229E Genogroup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The existence of multicontrast magnetic resonance (MR) images increases the level of clinical information available for the diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer patients. However, acquiring the complete set of multicontrast MR images is not always practically feasible. In this study, we developed a state\\\\of\\\\the\\\\art deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for image\\\\to\\\\image translation across three standards MRI contrasts for the brain. METHODS: BRATS2018 MRI dataset of 477 patients clinically diagnosed with glioma brain cancer was used in this study, with each patient having T1\\\\weighted (T1), T2\\\\weighted (T2), and FLAIR contrasts. It was randomly split into 64%, 16%, and 20% as training, validation, and test set, respectively. We developed a U\\\\Net model to learn the nonlinear mapping of a source image contrast to a target image contrast across three MRI contrasts. The model was trained and validated with 2D paired MR images using a mean\\\\squared error (MSE) cost function, Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate, and 120 epochs with a batch size of 32. The generated synthetic\\\\MR images were evaluated against the ground\\\\truth images by computing the MSE, mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal\\\\to\\\\noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM). RESULTS: The generated synthetic\\\\MR images with our model were nearly indistinguishable from the real images on the testing dataset for all translations, except synthetic FLAIR images had slightly lower quality and exhibited loss of details. The range of average PSNR, MSE, MAE, and SSIM values over the six translations were 29.44C33.25 dB, 0.0005C0.0012, 0.0086C0.0149, and 0.932C0.946, respectively. Our results were as good as the best\\\\reported results by other deep learning models on BRATS datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our U\\\\Net model exhibited that it can accurately perform image\\\\to\\\\image translation across brain MRI contrasts. It could hold great promise for clinical use for improved clinical decision\\\\making and better diagnosis of brain cancer patients due to the availability of multicontrast MRIs. This approach may be clinically relevant and setting a significant step to efficiently fill a gap of absent MR sequences without additional scanning.","output":"Deep learning\\\\based convolutional neural network for intramodality brain MRI synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, each and every part of the globe are facing a COVID crisis, which is affecting an individual physically, mentally and on the other hand, it is affecting the nation economically Also, the unemployment scenario will be at its peak in the upcoming years as reported by UNGA To combat this scenario, all the country are working on fostering their fiber network and so the sectors apart from the manufacturing, will tend to work from their home and contribute to the economy But there are many problems arising to implement this culture practically, since it affects the mindsets of the people who have to endure this transformation within a very short span Hence, in this research work, it has been decided to focus on this current issue for which the usage of certain apps in UAE such as zoom, totok, botim for internet calling have been identified since this is the only way of connectivity with the outside world To perform this analysis, the tweets from December to July have been collected by converting the image to text and analyzed using two algorithms such as Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) The sentimental analysis found that 630 tweets were positive and people in UAE feels secured, satisfied and internet calling is very useful for them in the prospect of work, education, etc Only 48 tweets has negative impact because people feel little bit harder in sudden change of culture with in short period of time and 155 tweets has impact that both positive and negative were view and said to be natural The study found that NB (84%) is more accurate, user friendly and takes less time than RNN (79%) to perform the analysis Finally, the sentimental analysis reveals that people in UAE were accepting the new culture of internet calling and it is useful for them in the prospect of work and education ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A Novel Approach to Predict the Real Time Sentimental Analysis by Naive Bayes RNN Algorithm during the COVID Pandemic in UAE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Covid-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to many aspects of life, including work processes to which we have become accustomed.

Care was initially provided by telephone, which has not been evaluated for its effectiveness by patients and providers. This study reports patients and nephrologists perceptions and preferences surrounding telephone consultation in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) clinic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient and physician perspectives on the key advantages and disadvantages of telephone consultations in a nephrology out-patient clinic setting. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational survey study. SETTING: General nephrology clinic and a multidisciplinary kidney care clinic in London, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CKD who were fluent in English and participated in at least one telephone consultation with a nephrologist during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: Nephrologists and participants input facilitated the development of both patient and nephrologist surveys. Participants provided self-reported measures in 5 domains of satisfaction: user experience, technical quality, perceived effectiveness on well-being, perceived usefulness, and effect on interaction. Nephrologists provided self-reported measures within 6 categories: general experience, time management, medication changes, quality of care, job satisfaction, and challenges/strengths. Descriptive statistics were used to present data. Content analysis was performed on 2 open-ended responses. RESULTS: Of the 372 participants recruited, 235 participated in the survey (63% response). In all, 79% of the participants were 65 years old and 91% were white. Telephone consultation was a comfortable experience for 68%, and 73% felt it to be a safer alternative during the pandemic. Although 65% perceived no changes to health care access, most reported spending less time and fewer resources on transit and parking. Disadvantages to telephone consultation included a lack of physical examination and reduced patient-physician rapport. Eleven of 14 nephrologists were surveyed, with most reporting confidence in the use of telephone consultation. Physician barriers to telephone consultation included challenges with communications and lack of technology to support telephone clinics. LIMITATIONS: Our survey included a majority of older, white participants, which may not be generalizable to other participants particularly those of other ages and ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Although both patients and nephrologists adapted to telephone consultations, there remain opportunities to further explore populations and situations that would be better facilitated with an in-person visit. Future research in virtual care will require measurement of health care outcomes and economics.

The Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification of antibiotics has been recently introduced in order to measure and improve patterns of antibiotic use. In this study, retrospective data about systemic antibiotic consumption (expressed in defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID)) in pediatric outpatients in a region in northern Spain (around 100,000 children up to 14 years old) from 2005 to 2018 were analyzed and compared with antibiotic consumption in general population in Spain. The pattern of use was analyzed by the percentage of the current AWaRe categories, the Access-to-Watch index, and the amoxicillin index. Data were calculated annually and compared into two periods. Mean antibiotic consumption in pediatric outpatients was 14.0 DID (CI 95% 13.38C14.62). It remained stable throughout the study and was lower than consumption in general population in Spain, particularly from 2016. Changes in the consumption of the main active principles have led to an improvement in the three metrics of the pattern of use.

These range from lack of sanitation, the collapsing economy, and poor access to clean drinking water which have made it arduous for the government and various other organizations in containing it. With the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment of typhoid became a challenge as focus was driven towards limiting the COVID-19 spread, and hence preferential use of antibiotics such as azithromycin may limit future empirical antibiotic therapy for typhoid. Socioeconomic disparities and geographical as well as demographic barriers further limit access to appropriate typhoid management. Lastly, illiteracy and self-medication with antibiotics may predispose Pakistan to another outbreak of typhoid. These concerns, although largely unaddressed effectively, need immediate action. Previously, the government and international organizations have made efforts to control the spread through the introduction of TCV as a part of EPI and awareness, additional improvements are needed.

However, its effective anti-IAV components and the mechanism of actions (MOAs) are not yet fully elucidated. In this study, we first summarized the chemical components and corresponding contents in BLG according to current available chemical analysis literature. We then presented a network-based in silico framework for identifying potential drug candidates against IAV from BLG. A total of 269 components in BLG were initially screened by drug-likeness and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) evaluation. Thereafter, network predictive models were built via the integration of compoundCtarget networks and influenza virusChost proteins. We highlighted 23 compounds that possessed high potential as anti-influenza virus agents. Through experimental evaluation, six compounds, namely, eupatorin, dinatin, linarin, tryptanthrin, indirubin, and acacetin, exhibited good inhibitory activity against wild-type H1N1 and H3N2. Particularly, they also exerted significant effects on drug-resistant strains. Finally, we explored the anti-IAV MOAs of BLG and showcased the potential biological pathways by systems pharmacology analysis.

Treatment was well tolerated; the only significant drug-related toxicities were (NCI CTC v.3) grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia increasing with (90)Y dose. There were no bleeding events or serious infections, and most cytopenias recovered to grade 1 within 12 weeks. Three patients at 25 mCi/m(2) encountered dose-limiting toxicity with grade 4 cytopenias more than 7 days, establishing 20 mCi/m(2) as the maximal tolerated (90)Y dose. Two patients developed HAHA of uncertain clinical significance. Most patients progressed rapidly and with CA19-9 levels increasing within 1 month of therapy, but 7 remained progression-free by CT for 1.5 to 5.6 months, including 3 achieving transient partial responses (32%-52% tumor diameter shrinkage).

Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.","output":"Sarcopenia during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions: long-term health effects of short-term muscle loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intimate partner violence (IPV)-defined as physical, psychological, sexual, and/or economic violence typically experienced by women at home and perpetrated by their partners or expartners-is a pervasive form of violence that destroys women's feelings of love, trust, and self-esteem, with important negative consequences on physical and psychological health. Many reports from several countries have underlined a remarkable increase in the cases of IPV during the COVID-19 emergency. In this opinion article, we discussed the hypothesis that such an increase may be related to the restrictive measures enacted to contain the pandemic, including women's forced cohabitation with the abusive partner, as well as the exacerbation of partners' pre-existing psychological disorders during the lockdown. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed some data derived from our practice in a public Italian referral center for sexual and domestic violence (Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence [SVSeD]). These data interestingly revealed an opposite trend, that is, a decrease in the number of women who sought assistance since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such a reduction should be interpreted as a negative consequence of the pandemic-related restrictive measures. Although necessary, these measures reduced women's possibilities of seeking help from antiviolence centers and/or emergency services. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need for developing and implementing alternative treatment options for IPV victims (such as online and phone counseling and telemedicine), as well as training programs for health care professionals, especially those employed in emergency departments, to facilitate early detection of IPV.","output":"COVID-19, Lockdown, and Intimate Partner Violence: Some Data from an Italian Service and Suggestions for Future Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) was witnessed and is the most threatening health crisis of our time.

Various authors have reported that saliva is a reliable specimen, alternative to nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs, to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections by RT-PCR. We assessed the performance of buccal swabs containing saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection by Ag-RDT, using mid-nasal specimens as a reference in the northern area of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) MethodsIn the context of routine clinical diagnosis of mild COVID-19 patients, we enrolled 300 adults in a study to directly compare mid-nasal swabs and saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection by Ag-RDT.. When mid-nasal and buccal Ag-RDTs showed discordant results, a third mid-nasal swab was collected and analysed by RT-PCR. ResultsPaired samples were successfully obtained in 300 suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 300 paired samples, Ag-RDT with the mid-nasal swab detected 139 (46.3%) positive COVID-19 cases. In comparison, buccal swabs showed a sensitivity and specificity of 31.7% (44/139) and 98.8% (159/161), respectively. 65 discordant results with positive mid-nasal swabs and negative buccal swabs were tested by RT-qPCR. All samples tested by Rt-PCR resulted positive, with a mean cycle threshold (Ct) of 28.3 (SD 7.3). ConclusionOur findings show that mid-nasal swabs have better performance than buccal swabs for detecting SARS-CoV-2 with Ag-RDT tests. Of note, the sensitivity of buccal samples was affected in samples with high viral loads (Ct<33), suggesting that buccal swabs might not be sensitive enough to detect individuals at risk of transmission.

In many cases, the structural stress was a result of incorrect allocation of medical care resources. In turn, this misallocation resulted from fear and apprehensions that superseded thorough calculations. A key role in exacerbating the healthcare sector overburdening was played by misleading information on the virus and disease caused by it. In the current paper, we study the situation in Russian healthcare system and advance recommendations how to avoid further crises. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (a) Surveying the medical personnel (231 doctors, 317 nurses and 355 ambulance medical workers of lower levels) in five hospitals and six ambulance centres in Moscow.

Methods We used multivariate logistic regression analysis on a linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older (registered with a GP practice in inner NEL) with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 February 2020 and 30 June 2020. We determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. Findings Over the study period 1,781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1,195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation while obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU and underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Importantly, we identified that having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR=4.75, 95%CI=(1.91,11.84), p=0.001).

Compared with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), HAP might have different traits regarding biomarkers due to the previous history in hospitals. METHODS: A total of 593 adult patients were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study to determine the neutrophil/lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum lactate level upon admission to the ICU. According to diagnosis, patients were divided into two groups: non-infection and HAP. Discriminant analysis was performed based on better outcomes of diagnostic performance and severity evaluation. The diagnostic performance of each individual biomarker was assessed by constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under each ROC curve (AUROC). Multivariable analysis was also applied to determine the most appropriate prognostic factors. RESULTS: NLCR, PCT and CRP were markedly different between the non-infection and HAP groups. NLCR had a worse ability to discriminate severe infection (AUROC 0.626; 95% CI 0.581C0.671) than conventional markers such as CRP (0.685, 95% CI 0.641C0.730) and PCT (0.661, 95% CI 0.615C0.707). In addition, the AUROC of composite biomarkers, especially the combination of NLCR, CRP and WBC, was significantly greater than that of any single biomarker.

MethodsWe conducted a test-negative design study using linked population-wide vaccination, laboratory testing, and health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. FindingsAgainst symptomatic infection caused by Alpha, vaccine effectiveness with partial vaccination ([]14 days after dose 1) was higher for mRNA-1273 (83%) than BNT162b2 (66%) and ChAdOx1 (64%), and full vaccination ([]7 days after dose 2) increased vaccine effectiveness for BNT162b2 (89%) and mRNA-1273 (92%). Protection against symptomatic infection caused by Beta/Gamma was also higher with partial vaccination for mRNA-1273 (77%) than BNT162b2 (60%) and ChAdOx1 (48%), and full vaccination increased effectiveness for BNT162b2 (84%). Against Delta, vaccine effectiveness after partial vaccination tended to be lower compared to Alpha for mRNA-1273 (72% vs. 83%) and BNT162b2 (56% vs. 66%), but was similar to Alpha for ChAdOx1 (67% vs. 64%). Full vaccination with BNT162b2 increased protection against Delta (87%) to levels comparable to Alpha (89%) and Beta/Gamma (84%). Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization or death caused by all VOCs was generally higher than for symptomatic infection after partial vaccination for all three vaccines.

Here, we investigated the role of Kctd9 in regulation of early development, maturation, and function of NK cells using Kctd9-knockout mice. Compared to wild-type mice, Kctd9-deficient mice exhibited impaired NK cell lineage commitment, as evidenced by selective reduction in the refined NK progenitors, and incomplete NK cell maturation, as manifested by a higher proportion of CD11b(?)

Moreover, Kctd9-depleted NK cells displayed insufficient IFN- production, degranulation, and granzyme B production in response to cytokine stimulation, and attenuated cytotoxicity to tumor cells in vitro. The defect in NK cells was further supported by ameliorated liver damage and improved survival in Kctd9-deficient mice following murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection, which otherwise leads to immune-mediated fulminant hepatitis, a phenotype homologous to that caused by NK cell depletion in wild-type mice. Further investigation to identify the underlying mechanism revealed that Kctd9 deficiency hindered the expression of transcription factors, including Ets1, Nfil3, Eomes, and Id2 in NK cells.

The Eating Attitudes Test, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18 and the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire were administered to the participants. The results showed that repetitive negative thinking was a partial mediator in the relationship between dieting and uncontrolled eating, as well as in the relationship between dieting and emotional eating. Targeting repetitive negative thinking may be important for reducing disinhibited eating patterns in women with normal body weight.","output":"Dieting and Disinhibited Eating Patterns in Adult Women with Normal Body Weight: Does Rumination Matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 affects vulnerable groups disproportionally in a society where inequities are long-standing issue.

Even if the quantities of goods fluctuate within a certain range, the customer can accept it and expects transaction. Under the mode of Make-to-order (MTO), for the supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a supplier with random yields, the optimization models about centralized and decentralized situation were established respectively based on flexible and fixed procurement strategy, and the differences of optimal ordering quantities, input quantities and performances between the two procurement strategies was analyzed. For the flexible procurement strategy, the coordination mechanism of revenues and risks sharing, outputs deficiency punishment was proposed;while for the fixed procurement one, the coordination mechanism was revenues and risks sharing, and wholesale price discount. The research showed that the optimal order quantities of manufacturer were the largest under flexible procurement strategy/centralized situation, then the second largest under fixed procurement strategy/centralized situation, and was the minimum and equal under decentralized situation for different strategies;for the supplier, the input quantities under flexible strategy was closer to the order quantities than the fixed strategy;from the perspective of performances analysis, the flexible procurement strategy was more beneficial to the whole supply chain and the supplier, while the fixed procurement one was more beneficial to the manufacturer. The internal and external conditions for determining purchasing strategies were given, and some measures were proposed to strengthen information sharing, promote strategic mutual trust and prevent moral hazard. ? 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS.

New nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strains have increasingly emerged in recent years; hence, evaluating their infection-influenced immune function changes and the alteration of metabolite profiling is important. Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into two groups: the control group (Con) and the disease group (Dis). Here, the partial cytokines were examined, and the metabolome alterations of the bursa of Fabricius (BF) in NIBV infections in chickens were profiled by gas chromatography time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS). The results revealed that the NIBV infection promotes the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic profile analysis indicated that clustering differed between the two groups and there were 75 significantly different metabolites detected between the two groups, suggesting that the host metabolism was significantly changed by NIBV infection. Notably, the following 12 metabolites were identified as the potential biomarkers: 3-phenyllactic acid, 2-deoxytetronic acid, aminomalonic acid, malonamide 5, uric acid, arachidonic acid, 2-methylglutaric acid, linoleic acid, ethanolamine, stearic acid, N-alpha-acetyl-l-ornithine, and O-acetylserine. Furthermore, the results of the correlation analysis showed that a strong correlation existed between metabolic biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a promising noninvasive method to determine CA continuously by using regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) as a surrogate for CBF. Little is known about its accuracy to determine CA in patients with intracranial lesions. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of rSO2-based CA monitoring with TCD methods in comatose patients with acute neurological injury. METHODS Thirty-three comatose patients were monitored at the bedside to measure CA using both TCD and NIRS. Patients were monitored daily for up to three days from coma onset. The cerebral oximetry index (COx) was calculated as the moving correlation between the slow waves of rSO2 and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The mean velocity index (Mx) was calculated as a similar coefficient between slow waves of TCD-measured CBF velocity and MAP. Optimal blood pressure was defined as the MAP with the lowest Mx and COx. Averaged Mx and COx as well as optimal MAP, based on both Mx and COx, were compared using Pearson's correlation. Bias analysis was performed between these same CA metrics. RESULTS The median duration of monitoring was 60 min (interquartile range [IQR] 48-78). There was a moderate correlation between the averaged values of COx and Mx (R = 0.40, p = 0.005). Similarly, there was a strong correlation between optimal MAP calculated for COx and Mx (R = 0.87, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed moderate agreement with bias (standard deviation) of -0.107 (0.191) for COx versus Mx and good agreement with bias of 1.90 (7.94) for optimal MAP determined by COx versus Mx. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring CA with NIRS-derived COx is correlated and had good agreement with previously validated TCD-based method. These results suggest that COx may be an acceptable substitute for Mx monitoring in patients with acute intracranial injury.","output":"Validation of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Monitoring Cerebral Autoregulation in Comatose Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported that when laying hens were fed diets supplemented with oils enriched in &#945;-linolenic acid (ALA) and oleic acid (OA), the deposition of n-3 PUFA in egg yolk was attenuated as compared to feeding hens a diet supplemented with the ALA-rich oil alone.

Parents' educational level was relatively diverse: 12% low (high school or lower), 33% medium (vocational training), and 55% high (college or university). Adolescents and parents reported on parental support, parent-adolescent conflict, autonomy support, psychological control, behavioral control, and time spent on various activities. Adolescents spent more time with their parents during LD (before M = 8.6 hr, during M = 12.7 hr), but less time with friends (before M = 8.1 hr, during M = 2.1 hr), and reported on average 13 COVID-19-related rules. Preregistered piecewise growth models confirmed that autonomy support decreased immediately during the LD, but no mean level changes were observed in the other relationship dimensions. During the first 2 months of the LD, parents reported gradual increases in autonomy support and decreases in behavioral control. Moreover, significant differences between families were found in sudden and more gradual relationship changes, which correlated strongly with pre-LD characteristics of the relationship, and in some models with adolescent oppositional defiance and legitimacy beliefs. In sum, findings suggest resilience in most families, but also heterogeneity: Some families were negatively affected, and others were positively affected. A tailored approach is therefore needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on family functioning.

As a step toward determining underlying mechanisms of persistence, we compared acute and persistent RV infections in infant euthymic and athymic rats inoculated oronasally with the University of Massachusetts strain of RV. Rats were assessed by virus isolation, in situ hybridization, and serology. Selected tissues also were analyzed by Southern blotting or immunohistochemistry. Virus was widely disseminated during acute infection in rats of both phenotypes, whereas vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) were the primary targets during persistent infection. The prevalence of virus-positive cells remained moderate to high in athymic rats through 8 weeks but decreased in euthymic rats by 2 weeks, coincident with seroconversion and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells. Virus-positive pneumocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells also were detected through 8 weeks, implying that kidney and lung excrete virus during persistent infection. Viral mRNA was detected in SMC of both phenotypes through 8 weeks, indicating that persistent infection includes virus replication. However, only half of the SMC containing viral mRNA at 4 weeks stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein expressed in cycling cells.

However, vectors based on common human pathogens would be expected to be restricted in replication in the adult human population due to high seroprevalence, an effect that would reduce vector immunogenicity. To address this issue, we evaluated Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus that is serotypically distinct from common human pathogens, as a vaccine vector. Two strains were evaluated: the attenuated vaccine strain LaSota (NDV-LS) that replicates mostly in the chicken respiratory tract and the Beaudette C (NDV-BC) strain of intermediate virulence that produces mild systemic infection in chickens. A recombinant version of each virus was modified by the insertion, between the P and M genes, of a gene cassette encoding the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, a test antigen with considerable historic data. The recombinant viruses were administered to African green monkeys (NDV-BC and NDV-LS) and rhesus monkeys (NDV-BC only) by combined intranasal and intratracheal routes at a dose of 10(6.5) PFU per site, with a second equivalent dose administered 28 days later. Little or no virus shedding was detected in nose-throat swabs or tracheal lavages following immunization with either strain. In a separate experiment, direct examination of lung tissue confirmed a highly attenuated, restricted pattern of replication by parental NDV-BC. The serum antibody response to the foreign HN protein induced by the first immunization with either NDV vector was somewhat less than that observed following a wild-type HPIV3 infection; however, the titer following the second dose exceeded that observed with HPIV3 infection, even though HPIV3 replicates much more efficiently than NDV in these animals. NDV appears to be a promising vector for the development of vaccines for humans; one application would be in controlling localized outbreaks of emerging pathogens.","output":"Recombinant newcastle disease virus expressing a foreign viral antigen is attenuated and highly immunogenic in primates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The UK is one of the epicenters of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the world. As of April 14, there have been 93 873 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in the UK and 12 107 deaths with confirmed infection. On April 14, it was reported that COVID-19 was the cause of more than half of the deaths in London. METHODS: The present paper addresses the modeling and forecasting of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK. This modeling must be accomplished through a 2-part time series model to study the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The period we aimed at a forecast was 46 days from April 15 to May 30, 2020. All the computations and simulations were conducted on Matlab R2015b, and the average curves and confidence intervals were calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models. RESULTS: According to the obtained model, we expect that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will reach 282 000 with an 80% confidence interval (242 000 to 316 500) on May 30, from 93 873 on April 14. In addition, it is expected that, over this period, the number of daily new confirmed cases will fall to the interval 1330 to 6450 with the probability of 0.80 by the point estimation around 3100.

B cells have been found to infiltrate various cancer types and play a role in tumor immunity, offering new immunotherapy opportunities. Nevertheless, the specific impact of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) on B cells has largely been overlooked. In the current study, we aimed to characterize TANs' role in the recruitment and modulation of B cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We showed that TANs actively participate in the recruitment of B cells to the TME and identified TNF as the major cytokine mediating B-cell chemotaxis by TANs. The recruitment of CD45+B220+CD138- splenic B cells by TANs in vitro resulted in B-cell phenotypic modulation, with 68.6{plus minus}2.1% of the total migrated B cells displaying a CD45-B220+CD138+ phenotype, typical for plasma cells. This phenotype mirrored the large proportion (54.0{plus minus}6.1%) of CD45-B220+CD138+ intratumoral B cells (i.e., plasma cells) in LLC tumors. We next confirmed that the differentiation of CD45+B220+CD138- B cells to functionally active CD45-B220+CD138+ plasma cells required contact with TANs, was independent of T cells, and resulted in IgG production. We further identified membranal BAFF on TANs as a potential contact mechanism mediating B-cell differentiation, as blocking BAFF-R significantly reduced by 20% IgG production. Our study, therefore, demonstrates that TANs drive the recruitment and modulation of B cells into plasma cells in the TME, hence opening new avenues in the targeting of the immune system in cancer.","output":"Tumor-associated neutrophils drive B-cell recruitment and their differentiation to plasma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The process of reintroducing bariatric surgery to our communities in a COVID-19 environment was particular to each country. Furthermore, no clear recommendation was made for patients with a previous COVID-19 infection and a favorable outcome who were seeking bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risks of specific complications for patients with previous COVID-19 infection who were admitted for bariatric surgery. SETTING: Eight high-volume private centers from 5 countries. METHODS: All patients with morbid obesity and previous COVID-19 infection admitted for bariatric surgery were included in the current study. Patients were enrolled from 8 centers and 5 countries, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to identify early (<30 d) specific complications related to COVID-19 infection following bariatric surgery, and the secondary outcome was to analyze additional factors from work-ups that could prevent complications. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 40 years (range, 21-68 yr) and a mean body mass index of 44.3 kg/m2 (7.4 kg/m2) with previous COVID-19 infection underwent different bariatric procedures: 23 cases of sleeve (65.7 %), 7 cases of bypass, and 5 other cases. The symptomatology of the previous COVID-19 infection varied: 15 patients had no symptoms, 12 had fever and respiratory signs, 5 had only fever, 2 had digestive symptoms, and 1 had isolated respiratory signs. Only 5 patients (14.2 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, for a mean period of 8.8 days (range, 6-15 d). One patient was admitted to an intensive care unit and needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean interval time from COVID-19 infection to bariatric surgery was 11.3 weeks (3-34 wk). The mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (1 d), and all patients were clinically evaluated 1 month following the bariatric procedure. There were 2 readmissions and 1 case of complication: that case was of a gastric leak treated with laparoscopic drainage and a repeated pigtail drain, with a favorable outcome. No cases of other specific complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: Minor and moderate COVID-19 infections, especially the forms not complicated with invasive mechanical ventilation, should not preclude the indication for bariatric surgery. In our experience, a prior COVID-19 infection does not induce additional specific complications following bariatric surgery.","output":"Bariatric surgery in patients with previous COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Controversy exists regarding the optimum number of flow diverters for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. We explored the effect of the number of Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) deployed on rates of aneurysm occlusion and complications. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent saccular intracranial aneurysm treatment solely with the PED were included in this retrospective study. Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, or digital subtraction angiographic images at 6 and 12 months and last follow-up (>12 months) were reviewed for aneurysm occlusion. Complication and retreatment rates were recorded and analyzed statistically. RESULTS The study included 141 aneurysm treatments in 119 patients. A single PED was deployed in 105 cases, two PEDs in 31 cases, and three PEDs in 5 cases (total = 182 devices). Six-month angiographic data were available for 103 patients. Occlusion rates were 67.1% for single-PED cases and 90.0% for cases with > 1 PED (p = 0.028). The 12-month occlusion rate (follow-up available for 132) for single-PED cases was 74.7% compared to 91.7% for multiple-PED cases (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, number of PEDs was an independent predictor of aneurysm occlusion at 12 months (odds ratio 6.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-22.8, p = 0.005). Thromboembolic complication rates were the same in the single- and multiple-PED treatment groups (2.8%). The retreatment rate was higher in patients treated with a single PED (16.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.01).

To find answers, it is important to study how such an intervention is perceived, experienced, and used by both patients and health care professionals (HCPs). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide perspectives on how FEV(1) home monitoring should be used in pediatric asthma. METHODS: This is a qualitative, multicenter, prospective, observational study which included patients with asthma aged 6-16 and HCPs. Primary outcomes were results of 2 surveys that were sent to all participants at study start and after 3-4 months. Secondary outcomes consisted of FEV(1) device usage during 4 months after receiving the FEV(1) device. RESULTS: A total of 39 participants (26 patients and 13 HCPs) were included in this study. Survey response rates were 97% (38/39) at the start and 87% (34/39) at the end of the study. Both patients and HCPs were receptive toward online FEV(1) home monitoring and found it contributive to asthma control, self-management, and disease perception. The main concerns were about reliability of the FEV(1) device and validity of home-performed lung function maneuvers. FEV(1) devices were used with a median frequency of 7.5 (IQR 3.3-25.5) during the 4-month study period. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and HCPs are receptive toward online FEV(1) home monitoring. Frequency of measurements varied largely among individuals, yet perceived benefits remained similar. This emphasizes that online FEV(1) home monitoring strategies should be used as a means to reach individual goals, rather than being a goal on their own.","output":"It Is Not Just the FEV1 That Matters, but the Personal Goals We Reach Along the Way: Qualitative, Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Study Aim To determine the perception of self-sufficiency and burnout levels of students studying in the faculty of sports sciences during the Covid-19 pandemic Material and Methods This cross-sectional descriptive-correlational study was performed in the Sports Science Faculty of Inonu University of Turkey which forms the universe of the study In addition, \\"Perception of General self-sufficiency\\" and \\"Burnout Level Scale\\" were used in the study T-test and One-Way ANOVA tests were used to perform the differential analysis and Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between variables In addition, regression analysis was performed by creating dummy variables in order to predict the dimensions Results The students'general self-sufficiency perception scores were found to be above average and their burnout levels were found to be below average It was observed that the general self-sufficiency perception scores differed in terms of the class variable, and the burnout level scores differed in terms of class, family income level and studied department variables In the correlation analysis that was carried out, it was understood that there was a mutually inverse and significant correlation between the dimensions of the scale With the regression analysis, it was determined that the first-grade level scores were an independent significant predictor for both self-sufficiency and burnout scores, and the lowest income level scores were only an independent predictor for burnout level scores Conclusions It can be said that students at the faculty of sports sciences are not overly affected by the Covid-19 Pandemic and the results are as desired It can be suggested that the perception of self-sufficiency and burnout scores to be correlated and predicted with different variables","output":"Examination of the perceptions of self-sufficiency and burnout levels of students of the sports science faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we describe our experiences during the first 6 months of the COVID-19-pandemic, as three teaching librarians at the University of Gothenburg, when almost all teaching at the University was transferred to an online format.

SETTING: Seven medical disciplines (general dermatology, dermato-oncology, head and neck oncology, internal medicine, medical oncology, gynaecological oncology and surgical oncology) at a large university hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who received and HCPs who provided TCs as a substitute for outpatient follow-up appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients and 58 HCPs were interviewed. Predominantly, patients and HCPs were satisfied with the quality of care by TCs. They regarded TCs as efficient, accessible and of acceptable quality, provided there was an established patient-HCP relationship, medical complaints were absent and physical examination was not indicated. However, most patients were worried about the accuracy of their health assessment in the absence of physical examination and non-verbal communication. Both patients and HCPs wish to use TCs in the future alternatively with face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that TCs seem a valuable contribution to the context of follow-up care and could partially replace face-to-face consultations. TCs can be performed in stable, chronic patients with whom a doctor-patient relationship has already been established. Face-to-face consultations are considered more appropriate in the case of new patients, challenging or emotionally charged consultations and when clinically relevant physical examination is indicated. Due to the context-dependent nature of experiences of patients and HCPs, TCs should be used with an individually customised approach based on patient and disease specifics, in which shared decision-making plays an extensive role.

The circadian amplitude of most physiological variables is reduced, while the circadian phase becomes more labile and tends to occur earlier with advancing age. As the incidence of falls in older persons could follow circadian variations, a better understanding of conditions in which falls occur can lead to the implementation of countermeasures (such as adjusting the scheduling of hospital staff, or changing the timing of anti-hypertensive medication if falls are related to undesirable circadian patterns of blood pressure and/or heart rate). This includes knowing the times of the day, days of the week, and times of the year when falls are more likely to occur at home or in the hospital. Additionally, the links between aging processes and factors associated with an increased risk of developing autonomic dysfunction are well established. A strong association between heart rate variability indexes and aging has been shown. Circadian rhythms of autonomous nervous system activity may play important role for maintenance of orthostatic tolerance. Whether one is concerned with disease prediction and prevention or maintenance of healthy aging, the study of circadian rhythms and the broader time structure underlying physiopathology is helpful in terms of screening, early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the timely institution of prophylactic and/or palliative/curative treatment. Timing the administration of such treatment as a function of circadian (and other) rhythms also could lead to reduction of falls in older persons. Finally, a prominent circadian rhythm characterizes melatonin, which peaks during the night. The circadian amplitude of melatonin decreases as a function of age, raising the questions whether such a decrease in the circadian amplitude of melatonin relates to a higher risk of falls and, if so, whether melatonin supplementation may be an effective countermeasure. This narrative review assesses the relationships between fall risk and the potential role circadian rhythms and melatonin play in mitigating this risk. We aim to provide healthcare workers adequate information about fall risk in older persons, including the potential role of the circadian rhythms and/or melatonin, as well as to lay foundations for future fall prevention interventional studies.","output":"Falls Risk, Circadian Rhythms and Melatonin: Current Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in late December 2019, coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) epidemic has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major public health event.

The impacts of lockdown policies on joint surgeries are unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explored whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care.Patients and methods - In 1,344,355 persons aged &#8805; 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries.Results - After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR a0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR a0.6). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR a0.6), whereas women aged &#8805; 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR a1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged &#8805; 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR a0.80)Interpretation - It is important to note for future pandemics management that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care.

Also, the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception in patients with VPT remains poorly understood. In the present study, a novel surgical method, termed transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery, was introduced to ameliorate VPT in patients with DSSD/T. The authors reviewed a case series, analyzed the surgical outcomes, and suggested the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception. The theoretical background underlying VPT improvement after transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery was also explored. METHODS Eight patients with VPT that was considered attributable to DSSD/T underwent transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery between February 2010 and February 2015. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.5 months (range 4-13 months). Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery featured simple mastoidectomy, partial compression of the SS using harvested cortical bone chips, and reinforcement of the bony SS wall with bone cement. Perioperative medical records, imaging results, and audiological findings were comprehensively reviewed. RESULTS In 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%), the VPT abated immediately after surgery. Statistically significant improvements in tinnitus loudness and distress were evident on numeric rating scales. Three patients with preoperative ipsilesional low-frequency hearing loss exhibited postoperative improvements in their low-frequency hearing thresholds. No major postoperative complications were encountered except in the first subject, who experienced increased intracranial pressure postoperatively. This subsided after a revision operation for partial decompression of the SS. CONCLUSIONS Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery may be a good surgical option in patients with DSSD/T, a previously unrecognized cause of VPT. Redistribution of severely asymmetrical blood flow, reinforcement of the bony SS wall with bone cement to reconstruct a soundproof barrier, and disconnection of a problematic sound conduction route via simple mastoidectomy silence VPT.","output":"Transmastoid reshaping of the sigmoid sinus: preliminary study of a novel surgical method to quiet pulsatile tinnitus of an unrecognized vascular origin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a 44-year-old male patient, health personnel with high blood pressure, who had contact with patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, training managers and their employees on the fundamentals of behavior-based programs such as the Siemens Energy Human Performance (HuP) program has proven challenging during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Training that traditionally was done in person, where people could interact and discuss root causes of accidents in the same room, had to be replaced with virtual training sessions. This paper reviews the key facets of the HuP program, which includes safety training, raising awareness of employees' susceptibility to human error, and how to design management systems as well as to promote behaviors to prevent safety incidents. It also reviews common practices in the program-including Stop Work authority, Safety Walk & Talks, daily toolboxes, and rapid risk assessment-and how they are being consolidated into one virtual training curriculum. People bring their own personal mix of skills, knowledge, experience, attitudes, motivation, habits, and personality to their jobs-and to each task that they routinely perform. The novelty of the HuP approach is that it empowers workers to recognize where errors occur, use the proper tools to change their habits, and then contribute equally to their own safety and operational excellence, rather than relying on written policies and discipline.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using a multi-stage sampling design was conducted online from 30 April to 30 July 2020 in China. A sample of 982 household heads from Guangdong Province and 530 household heads from Shaanxi province were involved in the data analysis. Demographic characteristics, social participation, beliefs and behaviors related to cigarette sharing and gifting were assessed. Chi-squared analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to explore the key factors associated with cigarette sharing and gifting, and to identify their relationship with smoking. RESULTS: The shared and gift cigarettes were both mainly offered to friends, and receiving gift cigarettes mostly occurred during the holidays. Gender and province were associated with cigarette sharing, and marital status and social participation were associated with cigarette gifting. Cigarette gifting beliefs and smoking status were prominent predictors for both sharing and gifting cigarettes. Cigarette gifting beliefs were significantly higher among smokers than non-smokers, and people with high cigarette gifting beliefs were 1.68 (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=19.17; 95% CI: 13.31C27.61) times more likely to be a smoker. Offering shared cigarettes has been found to significantly predict tobacco use (AOR=19.17; 95% CI: 13.31C27.61), while people who received shared and gift cigarettes were 1.50 (95% CI: 1.08C2.09) and 2.58 (95% CI: 1.66C4.00) times more likely to be a current smoker than those who did not receive cigarettes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette sharing and gifting were especially pervasive among male smokers and married people in Shaanxi Province.

The risk factors for depression were age group (20-35 years) (51.3% vs 61.3%) and employed at a primary care hospital (16.2% vs 23.4%). The protective factors were job profile (doctor) (69.9% vs 59.6%) and having service of more than 20 years (22.3% vs 15.5%). CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of the HCWs reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The risk factors for anxiety symptoms were female gender, younger age and job profile (nurse) and for depressive symptoms were younger age and working at a primary care hospital. Future research studies should identify strategies for providing a safer and supportive work environment for HCWs to face epidemics/pandemics.","output":"Survey of prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among 1124 healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic across India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 patients thought unlikely to benefit from organ support, thereby having a ward-based ceiling of care (WBCoC), represent a distinct subgroup.

The resulting erythrocyte deformation causes mechanical obstruction of blood flow by sickled cells, hemolysis, anemia and end-organ injury. While pain is the hallmark symptom of SCD, chronic organ injury as a result of anemia, inflammation and progressive vasculopathy play a major role in morbidity and mortality. Due to the complex pathophysiology of SCD, the need for an individualized, multi-modal pharmacologic approach is apparent. Until 2018, hydroxyurea was the only disease-modifying pharmacologic therapy approved for use in SCD. Since then, three new agents have been approved including voxelotor, the subject of this review. Areas covered: Published pre-clinical and clinical data are reviewed. Voxelotor is a first-in-class small molecule agent that binds to Hb and increases oxygen affinity, preventing polymerization. Recent clinical trials have shown that it increases Hb concentration and reduces hemolysis in patients with SCD. This increase in Hb concentration may significantly impact morbidity and mortality from chronic organ injury. Expert opinion: The mechanism of action, published studies, and current opinions on the clinical use of voxelotor in SCD are presented.","output":"Voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries have taken a variety of measures to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 infections. Among the most important of these involve using social distancing to prevent contact. Restricted social contacts have important effects on activity participation and on travel demand. The current study examined an array of less-studied factors, such as attitudes and beliefs toward train use, including risk perception of flu-type infection, alongside more traditional factors, which together affect decisions whether to continue using the train. Data was collected using an internet survey application. The study was based on two surveys that were conducted approximately seven months apart, the first completed by 237 participants and the second by 149. We developed a structural equation model to better understand the influence of various factors on decisions whether to continue to use the train. We found a correlation between perception of the risk of infection and the decision to continue train travel. Study results also demonstrate the relation between trip purpose and the decision to use public transportation. The study results highlight the importance of many attributes favorably associated with train travel, including saving time, reliability, and comfort. Therefore, in contrast to the existing situation where the railway company makes its own decisions to decrease trip frequencies and to cancel some lines, government policy makers and the railway company should maintain a strong frequency schedule and increase the number of lines in order to accommodate social distancing. In addition, we found that the most effective measures for encouraging people to keep travelling by train required mask use, preventing people with flu-like symptoms from traveling by train, and fining those who do not comply. In order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles it is important to decrease the risk perception of being infected by coronavirus and other kinds of infected diseases while traveling by train. This can be addressed by creating a clean and reasonably sterile environment. These results highlight the need for serious intervention by decision-makers in order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles.","output":"Extent to which COVID-19 will affect future use of the train in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo/Objetivo No contexto de pandemia de COVID-19,  importante identificar os grupos de risco associados a piores prognsticos da doen?a.

Various community-training programmes have improved practices like bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using automated external defibrillator (AED). Post-resuscitation care has also changed significantly in the millennium. Interventions like targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hyperoxia and emergency cardiac catheterisation have given patients a chance of a better neurological outcome. Despite these timely interventions, it is still very difficult to predict neurological outcome. The European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC-ESICM) published guidance in 2015 with a strong recommendation to delay prognostication for at least 72 h and with an emphasis to adapt a multimodal approach, which includes neurological examination, biomarkers, electroencephalogram (EEG) and radiological tests. These interventions not only have cost attached to them, but the unpredictability has a significant emotional impact on family members. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring device acts on the principle of EEG and converts the waveform into an absolute number and also measures the burst suppression. We hypothesize that patients who have a low BIS value and high burst suppression within 24 h of presentation will have a poor neurological outcome. The primary objective of this review is to look at BIS monitor as a tool, which could help bring forward the timing of prognostication. METHODS Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies with no language restrictions.

All three departments independently elected to use an automated telephone message to promote their smoke alarm programs. Uptake of smoke alarm installation services ranged between .02% and 2% of the calls placed. In Rochester, automated calls were sent to all residential landlines via the city's non-emergency call center; requests for smoke alarms increased by a factor of 7.5 in the month following the campaign. In Grand Rapids, automated calls were sent to 6% of the households served due to the telecommunications infrastructure; because of the limited reach, the overall number of requests remained unchanged, and the number of callers citing the automated calls was less than the number of requests callers reported were motivated by Grand Rapids' existing promotion strategies. In Cloquet, the automated calls were broadcast on a rolling basis to geographic clusters of households; although the number of requests remained unchanged, fire district officials were pleased to reduce driving time between appointments which allowed volunteers to offer more home visit appointments.

Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020. RESULTS: 1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, p<0.001), HIV infection (11% vs 5%,p<0.001), cancer (11% vs 6%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15% vs 8%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (15% vs 9%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11% vs 8%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005).

The conceptual model was tested utilizing baseline data from a longitudinal, observational, community-engaged research study of young adult (18C44 years) Latinx immigrants residing in North Carolina (N = 391). Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships among documentation status, healthcare, and immigration stress in the past six months, and self-rated physical health. Goodness-of-fit measures indicated that data fit the model well (RMSEA = .008; CFI = 1.0; TLI = .999; SRMR = .02; CD = .157). Undocumented individuals were more likely to experience immigration stress than their documented counterparts ([Formula: see text] = ? 0.37, p < 0.001).

Here, we evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that led surgeons to forego a second surgery for CALND in cN0 mastectomy patients with positive SLNB. PATIENTS AND METHODS A single institution, retrospective review of cN0 patients with invasive primary breast cancer and positive SLNB from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Patients with T4 disease, positive preoperative axillary biopsy, prior neoadjuvant therapy or axillary surgery were excluded. Patients with positive SLNB undergoing CALND were compared with patients for whom CALND was omitted. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and 2 tests or Fischer exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS Of 259 patients with positive SLNB, 180 (69.4%) patients underwent mastectomy. CALND was performed at the time of mastectomy in 54 (30%) patients, at time of second operation in 22 (12.2%) patients, and not performed in 104 (57%) patients. Delayed CALND was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumors, increased number of positive sentinel nodes, invasive lobular carcinoma, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion. CONCLUSIONS The management of cN0 patients with positive SLNB that do not meet ACOSOG Z0011 criteria is evolving and is influenced by tumor and patient characteristics in an attempt to balance the morbidity of CALND with the low rate of local regional recurrence.","output":"Surgeon Bias in the Management of Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To document the viral etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRIs) in Chinese children.

METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from all subjects. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), type 1 to 3 parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and type A and B influenza virus (Flu) were detected by direct immunofluorescence. RESULTS Viruses were identified in 32.3% cases, including RSV (23.6%), PIV 3 (4.3%), Flu A (2.0%), ADV (1.7%), PIV I (0.6%), Flu B (0.2%) and PIV 2 (0.1%). RSV and PIV 3 predominated in younger children while Flu A and Flu B predominated in older children (P<0.001, respectively). PIV 1 was more prevalent in children aged 1 to 3 years. The peak frequency of RSV, PIV 3 and Flu A were in early spring, June to August, and August and September, respectively. Flu B had a peak in the winter and spring. Adenovirus infections occurred in all seasons with a relatively constant frequency. CONCLUSIONS Viruses are an important cause of ALRIs in Chinese children constituting 1/3 of total cases.

MEE samples, collected at the time of myringotomy from 37 children with OME were assessed. Physical examination, skin prick tests and a standardized questionnaire on OME and allergy were also performed. Viral RNA was detected by the use of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Fifteen samples (40.5%) were positive for rhinovirus (RV). One enterovirus and no other respiratory viruses were detected. Two out of five (40%), 3/7 (43%) and 10/25 (40%) were positive for RV in acute, subacute and chronic cases, respectively. Children with frequent episodes of OM, with early onset of OM (<2 yr old), and a positive family history of allergy had a statistically increased risk of RV detection. The two groups were comparable with respect to all other parameters examined. RV is the predominant virus recovered by RT-PCR in the middle ear cavity of children with asymptomatic OME, especially those with a history of longstanding OME or repeated episodes, or children with a family history of allergy.

Although the layout is an important design factor that affects interface aesthetics, whether it can trigger customer's aesthetic preferences in mobile marketing remains unexplored. To address this issue, we employ an empirical methodology of event-related potentials (EPR) in this study from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. Subjects are presented with a series of mobile marketing interface images of different layouts with identical marketing content. Their EEG waves were recorded as they were required to distinguish a target stimulus from the others. After the experiment, each of the subjects chose five stimuli interfaces they like and five they dislike. By analyzing the ERP data derived from the EEG data and the behavioral data, we find significant differences between the disliked interfaces and the other interfaces in the ERP component of P2 from the frontal-central area in the 200C400 ms post-stimulus onset time window and LPP from both the frontal-central and parietal-occipital area in the 400C600 ms time window. The results support the hypothesis that humans do make rapid implicit aesthetic preferences for interface layouts and suggest that even under a free browsing context like the mobile marketing context, interface layouts that raise high emotional arousal can still attract more user attention and induce users' implicit aesthetic preference.","output":"The Implicit Aesthetic Preference for Mobile Marketing Interface LayoutAn ERP Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comorbidities in COVID\\\\19 patients often worsen clinical conditions and may represent death predictors.

Establishing healthy habits in childhood on the basis of the World Health Organizations 2020 Physical Activity Guidelines is essential for proper physical, motor, and cognitive development. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to describe the level of physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and sleep of the child and adolescent population from 6 to 17 years of age in the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC). Our secondary aim is to establish a starting point for future research and intervention protocols to improve the existing reality. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aims to recruit 1111 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 17 years from the BAC in a representative random sample. Participants will wear the ActiGraph WGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer for 7 consecutive days in their nondominant wrist, and fill out a habit diary log of PA, mobility, and sleep routine. PA intensities, sedentary behavior, and sleep parameters (total bedtime, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency) will be calculated from raw accelerometer data using SPSS (IBM Corp). Participants will be randomly selected. RESULTS: The results of this study intend to demonstrate significant differences in PA levels in different age and gender groups since the volume of school PA in the BAC decreases as the age of the schoolchildren increases. The total study sample includes 1111 participants. In April 2021, up to 50% of the sample size was reached, which is expected to increase to 100% by April 2022. This sample will allow us to analyze, discuss, compare, and assess the reality of the school population, in a sensitive period of adherence to behavior patterns, using data from the geographical and administrative area of the BAC. This study will provide a realistic insight into PA levels among children and adolescents in the BAC. It will also offer scientific contributions on the positive relationship between PA levels and sleep quality in this population. CONCLUSIONS: This study might highlight the need for the promotion of cross-sectional policies so that children and adolescents may increase their levels of PA, thus improving both the school environment and positive healthy behavior.

This can have positive or negative consequences on health-seeking behaviours. Understanding how consultation with lay social networks works in informal urban settlements of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is important to enable health and policy-makers to maximise its potential to aid healthcare delivery and minimise its negative impacts. This study explored the composition, content and consequences of lay consultation in informal urban settlements of LMICs. DESIGN: Mixed-method systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Six key public health and social science databases, Google Scholar and reference lists of included studies were searched for potential articles. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Papers that described discussions with lay informal social network members during symptoms or illness experiences. DATA ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS: Quality assessment was done using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were analysed and synthesised using a stepwise thematic synthesis approach involving two steps: identifying themes within individual studies and synthesising themes across studies. RESULTS: 13 studies were included in the synthesis. Across the studies, three main categories of networks consulted during illness: kin, non-kin associates and significant community groups. Of these, kin networks were the most commonly consulted. The content of lay consultations were: asking for suggestions, negotiating care-seeking decisions, seeking resources and non-disclosure due to personal or social reasons. Lay consultations positively and negatively impacted access to formal healthcare and adherence to medical advice. CONCLUSION: Lay consultation is mainly sought from social networks in immediate environments in informal urban settlements of LMICs.

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, that still keeps its impacts worldwide, numerous scheduled medical activities have been postponed and this interruption has a potential to modify the management of many cutaneous conditions including pemphigus. This narrative review aims to discuss the management of pemphigus in the era of COVID-19, considering the necessity to balance suitable pemphigus treatment with minimal risk of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity. The data on the effect of treatments used for pemphigus on COVID-19 are limited. However, the evidence to manage patients properly is evolving and our knowledge is updated. Current expert recommendations include that patients with pemphigus should be informed clearly to avoid mismanagement and they should be monitored regularly for symptoms of COVID-19. Patients with mild disease can be managed with topical or intralesional corticosteroids, dapsone, or doxycycline. Systemic corticosteroids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose during the pandemic. Prednis(ol)one &#8804;10 mg/d can be continued in patients with COVID-19 while prednis(ol)one >10 mg/d may be reduced considering the activity of the disease.

However, the questions of whether and why being involved in a public health emergency like the COVID-19 crisis could modify consumer behaviors have been underexplored by previous literature. Drawing on the theory of awe that highlights the important role in influencing human behaviors when they are facing unexpected events that transcends the frame of existing references, the present research aims to clarify the relationship between COVID-19 involvement and consumer preference for utilitarian versus hedonic products. We collected data from 512 Chinese participants (319 women; average age 29.11 years; SD = 11.89) during the outbreak of COVID-19. The results of structural equation modeling showed that COVID-19 involvement was positively related to the preference for utilitarian products (vs. hedonic products). More importantly, this relationship could be explained via the mediated effects of awe, problem-focused coping, and social norm compliance.

The coefficient of variation can be used to measure rainfall dispersion to produce information for predicting future rainfall, thereby mitigating future disasters. Rainfall data usually consist of positive and true zero values that correspond to a delta-lognormal distribution. Therefore, the coefficient of variation of delta-lognormal distribution is appropriate to measure the rainfall dispersion more than lognormal distribution. In particular, the measurement of the dispersion of precipitation from several areas can be determined by measuring the common coefficient of variation in the rainfall from those areas together. Herein, we compose confidence intervals for the common coefficient of variation of delta-lognormal distributions by employing the fiducial generalized confidence interval, equal-tailed Bayesian credible intervals incorporating the independent Jeffreys or uniform priors, and the method of variance estimates recovery. A combination of the coverage probabilities and expected lengths of the proposed methods obtained via a Monte Carlo simulation study were used to compare their performances. The results show that the equal-tailed Bayesian based on the independent Jeffreys prior was suitable. In addition, it can be used the equal-tailed Bayesian based on the uniform prior as an alternative.

The survey found that care was rated highly, including among people of Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background. However, sleep-quality and communication about medications and discharge-planning were identified as areas for improvement. Methods: To improve care for people with COVID-19 admitted to our centre, we designed an educational package for healthcare professionals working on COVID-19 wards. The package, implemented in August 2020, included healthcare worker training sessions on providing holistic care and placement of Practice Pointers posters. Patient satisfaction was re-evaluated during the second/third COVID-19 waves in Liverpool (September 2020 - February 2021). Results: Across waves, most (95%) respondents reported that they would recommend our hospital to friends and/or family and rated overall care highly.

However, a large-scale study on the prevalence of viral infections across multiple provinces and seasons has not been previously reported from China. Here, we aimed to identify the viral etiologies associated with ALRIs from 22 Chinese provinces. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients in 108 sentinel hospitals in 24 provinces of China was conducted from January 2009-September 2013. We enrolled hospitalized all-age patients with ALRI, and collected respiratory specimens, blood or serum collected for diagnostic testing for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human influenza virus, adenoviruses (ADV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV). We included 28,369 ALRI patients from 81 (of the 108) sentinel hospitals in 22 (of the 24) provinces, and 10,387 (36.6%) were positive for at least one etiology. The most frequently detected virus was RSV (9.9%), followed by influenza (6.6%), PIV (4.8%), ADV (3.4%), hBoV (1.9), hMPV (1.5%) and hCoV (1.4%). Co-detections were found in 7.2% of patients. RSV was the most common etiology (17.0%) in young children aged <2 years. Influenza viruses were the main cause of the ALRIs in adults and elderly. PIV, hBoV, hMPV and ADV infections were more frequent in children, while hCoV infection was distributed evenly in all-age. There were clear seasonal peaks for RSV, influenza, PIV, hBoV and hMPV infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could serve as robust evidence for public health authorities in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ALRIs associated with viral pathogens. RSV is common in young children and prevention measures could have large public health impact.

We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino- 1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms.

Although there is currently limited understanding of how COVID\\\\19 affects PLHIV, it is imperative that public health systems and academic centers monitor the impact of COVID\\\\19 on PLHIV. The general principles of the HIV program adaptation guidance from PEPFAR prioritize protecting the gains in the HIV response while minimizing in\\\\person home and facility visits and other direct contact when COVID\\\\19 control measures are in effect. PEPFAR\\\\supported clinical, laboratory, supply chain, community and data reporting systems can play an important role in mitigating the impact of COVID\\\\19 in sub\\\\Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: As community transmission of COVID\\\\19 continues and the number of country cases rise, fragile health systems may be strained. Utilizing the adaptive, data\\\\driven program approaches in facilities and communities established and supported by PEPFAR provides the opportunity to strengthen the COVID\\\\19 response while protecting the immense gains spanning HIV prevention, testing and treatment reached thus far.","output":"PEPFARs Response to the Convergence of the HIV and COVID\\\\19 Pandemics in Sub\\\\Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite an increase in the familiarity of the medical community with the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is presently a lack of rapid and effective risk stratification indicators to predict the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19 especially in severe patients. Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 117 cases confirmed with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were collected and analyzed during admission. The Multi-lobular infiltration, hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension and Age (MuLBSTA) Score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score were used to assess the death and intensive care unit (ICU) risks in all patients. Results: Among of all 117 hospitalized patients, 21 (17.9%) patients were admitted to the ICU care, and 5 (4.3%) patients were died. The median hospital stay was 12 (10C15) days. There were 18 patients with MuLBSTA score  12 points and were all of severe type. In severe type, ICU care and death patients, the proportion with MuLBSTA  12 points were greater than that of CURB65 score  3 points (severe type patients, 50 vs. 27.8%; ICU care, 61.9 vs. 19.0%; death, 100 vs. 40%). For the MuLBSTA score, the ROC curve showed good efficiency of diagnosis death (area under the curve [AUC], 0.956; cutoff value, 12; specificity, 89.5%; sensitivity, 100%) and ICU care (AUC, 0.875; cutoff value, 11; specificity, 91.7%; sensitivity, 71.4%). The KCM survival analysis showed that patients with MuLBSTA score  12 had higher risk of ICU (log-rank, P = 0.001) and high risk of death (log-rank, P = 0.000). Conclusions: The MuLBSTA score is valuable for risk stratification and could effectively screen high-risk patients at admission. The higher score at admission have higher risk of ICU care and death in patients infected with COVID.","output":"Performance of Two Risk-Stratification Models in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review highlights the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in children and neonates and contrasts these features with other common respiratory viruses.

There are no distinctive clinical characteristics that will allow the infectious disease consultant to make the diagnosis without laboratory testing. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less common with lower morbidity and mortality than RSV or influenza and causes less severe disease in children with cancer than these more common viruses.

It is unclear whether, and which, baseline echocardiographic abnormalities may refine triage in the emergency department beyond clinical risk factors, and hence help identify patients at higher risk for need for hospitalization. We aimed to investigate echocardiographic variables associated with risk of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Electronic health records (EHR) were screened retrospectively to identify adults with a positive COVID-19 test throughout St. Lukes University Health Network from March 1, 2020-October 31, 2020, and had a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within 15-180 days prior. Baseline medical co-morbidities and echocardiographic variables were compared between patients stratified by hospitalization. Continuous variables were compared using Students t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test;categorical variables using the  2-test or Fishers Exact test. Univariate logistic regression was used to select significant predictors for multivariate analysis. Backward stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of need for hospitalization, a surrogate for mild versus moderate-severe disease. Results: 193 patients met inclusion criteria (83 hospitalized). Mean TTE to COVID19 positivity time was 8652 days. Hospitalized patients were older and more likely to suffer co-morbidities (Table 1). Age, medical co-morbidities and several echocardiographic variables predicted need for hospitalization. Multivariate analysis revealed age, coronary disease, COPD, and left atrial (LA) enlargement (4 cm) independently predicting hospitalization with excellent discrimination (AUC 0.809, figure 1). Estimates plots are depicted in Figure 2. Conclusion: We present, to our knowledge the first cohort indicating that LA enlargement, in a largely unselected population, is an independent marker of need for hospitalization (a surrogate for worse than mild disease) among COVID-19 patients, and could perhaps be considered in addition to clinical risk assessment in the ED, when available. Being upstream from the left ventricle (LV), LA enlargement is an indicator of sustained LV pressure and/or volume overload resulting from diverse etiologies, including hypertension, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. Hence, LA size has long been known to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality among patients with underlying cardiovascular disease as well as the general population. Importantly, LA diameter emerged as a more powerful predictor than LV hypertrophy of COVID-19 severity, as indicated by need for hospitalization.

The facets of financial worry and their associated psychological burden have been understudied among the immigrant population. The goal of this study was to determine the specific facets of financial worry and associated psychological burden in immigrants. This cross-sectional study, which used data from the 2013 to 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), examined patient-reported measures of worry regarding financial strain. The NHIS is a household survey of noninstitutionalized, nonmilitary adults in the United States. Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions were used to define adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for financial worry and psychological distress, adjusting for various sociodemographic variables. Among 131,669 US-born and 26,155 non-US-born participants who responded to all 6 questions on the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), the overall prevalence of participants reporting any serious psychological distress (K6 score 13) was 3.0% and 2.25%, respectively. Despite these overall prevalence data, there were specific areas of financial worries that were higher in non-US-born participants than in US-born participants. Compared with US-born participants, non-US-born participants had higher rates of financial worries regarding retirement [75.78% vs. 69.08%, AOR=1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-1.45, P<0.001], medical costs due to illness (worry about not being able to pay medical costs of a serious illness or accident) (74.94% vs. 65.27%, AOR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.29-1.45, P<0.001), standard of living (74.25% vs. 65.29%, AOR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.34-1.51, P<0.001), and medical cost of health care (worry about not having enough to pay medical costs for normal health care) (66.52% vs. 52.67%, AOR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.43-1.60, P<0.001), among other costs.

These emergency protocols were intended to ensure patient safety and called for dose modifications, treatment delays and treatment interruptions as necessary to minimize exposure risks to COVID-19. Because there are no established maintenance protocols for CLs, the impact of such delays or interruptions on disease outcomes was not known. The ISCL created an International Cutaneous Lymphomas Pandemic Section (ICLYPS) to collect data from the institutions around the world to assess the impact of these changes on patients outcomes and to determine if these measures were effective in preventing infection. We summarize the outcomes from a preliminary cohort of patients from Brazil, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Actively managed patients with an established diagnosis of CL from March to October 2020 were included according to the Institutional Protection of Human Subjects guidelines at the respective centers. We included 149 patients in this retrospective review. The average age was 61.88 years (range: 22C95). 2 patients (1.3%) had diagnoses of CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LyP and pcALCL), 112 (75.2%) had mycosis fungoides (MF), and 35 (23.5%) had Szary syndrome (SS). 77 patients (68.7%) had stages IACIIA MF, 23 (20.5%) had Stage IIB MF, 6 (5.4%) had stage III MF, and 41 (27.5%) had Stage IV disease, of which 6 had Stage IV MF (5.4%) and 35 had SS (23.5%). Treatment was delayed for more than half (53.0%) of the patients for a mean of 3.2 months (range: 10 days to 10 months). Treatment delay was associated with a significant risk of disease relapse or progression across all stages (65.8% vs 32.9%, p<0.00001). During follow up, 6 patients (4%) died due to disease progression, including 3 patients with Stage IIB MF, one with Stage IVB MF, and two with SS. Twenty-eight patients (18.8%) had a confirmed COVID-19 infection during the capture period. Two of these cases were definitive hospital-acquired infections following prolonged hospital admission, while the remaining contracted the virus through community exposures. There were no outpatient office-acquired infections. Three of the 26 patients who contracted COVID-19 died of the infection (2 SS and 1 LyP, mean age: 80, range: 66C89). The ICLYPS analysis has revealed that treatment interruptions and delays during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significantly worse outcomes in patients with CLs as compared to those who did not experience treatment interruptions. No outpatient office-acquired infections were reported in this extensive review, and patients with CLs who developed COVID-19 did not do worse than expected according to their risk factors. Effective safety measures and protocols can prevent transmission of COVID-19 at physicians offices. Interruption of therapy leads to negative clinical outcomes and should be avoided, especially in the setting of advanced disease, as the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the outpatient setting did not outweigh the risk of morbidity and mortality due to disease progression. Ensuring continuity of treatment and maintenance therapy appears to be critical to avoiding life-threatening disease progression.","output":"Epi-O-02 International Cutaneous Lymphomas Pandemic Section (ICLYPS) analysis of CTCL outcomes during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM Diagnostic yield of video capsule endoscopy may be hampered by intestinal content or air bubbles. A major limitation in video capsule-related study is the lack of a validated objective score for bowel preparation quality. We aimed to design and validate a computed small bowel preparation score for research and clinical use. METHODS Two experienced physicians reached a consensus regarding bowel preparation quality based on known criteria used in previous studies and their confidence of an accurate medical interpretation of the procedure. A computed algorithm based on the pixels in the color bar was created and validated. Concordance between the gastroenterologists' agreement (gold standard) and the computed analysis was assessed. RESULTS Of 85 videos studied, 44 (52%), 13 (15%) and 28 (33%) had adequate, borderline and inadequate bowel preparation, respectively, according to the gastroenterologists' agreement. Computer analysis restricted to adequate and inadequate cases yielded accurate classification of bowel preparation in 65/72 cases (90% agreement, sensitivity 95%, specificity 82%, total accuracy 90%, Kappa 0.79). When adding the borderline definition, the computer analysis correctly classified 71/85 of the cases, yielding an overall agreement of 84% (Kappa 0.72). Minute-by-minute analysis of 10 cases also yielded an agreement of 91.4%.

There are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many closely related (corona-) viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the well-known position-weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and use to generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus.","output":"PWM2Vec: An Efficient Embedding Approach for Viral Host Specification from Coronavirus Spike Sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systematic screening of accelerated chemical reactions at solid/solution interfaces has been carried out in high-throughput fashion using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and it provides evidence that glass surfaces accelerate various base-catalyzed chemical reactions.

In a detailed mechanistic study, we provide evidence using nanoESI showing that glass surfaces can act as strong bases and convert protic solvents into their conjugate bases which then act as bases/nucleophiles when participating in chemical reactions. In aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, glass surfaces act as green heterogeneous catalysts that can be recovered and reused after simple rinsing. Besides their use in organic reaction catalysis, glass surfaces are also found to act as degradation reagents for phospholipids with increasing extents of degradation occurring at low concentrations. This finding suggests that the storage of base/nucleophile-labile compounds or lipids in glass containers should be avoided.","output":"Glass surface as strong base, green heterogeneous catalyst and degradation reagent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, metabolic syndrome has become a global health problem.

Three statistical methods-standardized incidence ratio (SIR), segmented regression, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-were used to determine whether Amerithrax influenced inpatient utilization. The SIR found a non-statistically significant 2 percent decrease in hospital discharges. Although the segmented regression test found a slight increase in the discharge rate during the fourth quarter, it was also not statistically significant; therefore, it could not be attributed to Amerithrax. Segmented regression diagnostics preparing for ARIMA indicated that the quarterly data time frame was not serially correlated and violated one of the assumptions for the use of the ARIMA method and therefore could not properly evaluate the impact on the time-series data. Lack of data granularity of the time frames hindered the successful evaluation of the impact by the three analytic methods.

METHODS: COVID-19-recovered patients, who had no previous underlying diseases and were discharged from Wuhan Union Hospital for 3 months, and matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this prospective cohort study. We examined the blood biochemical indicators, cytokines, lung computed tomography scans, including 39 HCs, 18 recovered asymptomatic (RAs), 34 recovered moderate (RMs), and 44 recovered severe/ critical patients (RCs). A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was employed to profile the global metabolites of fasting plasma of these participants. RESULTS: Clinical data and metabolomic profiles suggested that RAs recovered well, but some clinical indicators and plasma metabolites in RMs and RCs were still abnormal as compared with HCs, such as decreased taurine, succinic acid, hippuric acid, some indoles, and lipid species. The disturbed metabolic pathway mainly involved the tricarboxylic cycle, purine, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, metabolite alterations differ between RMs and RCs when compared with HCs. Correlation analysis revealed that many differential metabolites were closely associated with inflammation and the renal, pulmonary, heart, hepatic, and coagulation system functions.

ACS patients with Covid-19 were further compared with those without. RESULTS: Among 779 ACS patients admitted during the case period, 67 (8.6%) tested positive for Covid-19. In-hospital all-cause mortality was significantly higher during the case period compared to the control periods (6.4% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4% respectively; p 0.026), but similar after excluding patients with COVID-19 (4.5% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4%; p 0.73). Cardiovascular mortality was similar between the study groups. After multivariable adjustment, admission for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak had no impact on in-hospital mortality. In the case period, patients with concomitant ACS and Covid-19 experienced significantly higher in-hospital mortality (25% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without. Moreover, higher rates of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia were found in Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSION: ACS patients presenting during the Covid-19 pandemic experienced increased all-cause mortality, driven by Covid-19 positive status due to higher rates of cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia. No differences in cardiovascular mortality compared to non-pandemic scenarios were reported.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and infection on in hospital survival for patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: A multicenter registry()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air travel is generally safe, but it can pose physiologic challenges to some.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) in eight Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. RESULTS: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unit-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCWs, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCWs.","output":"Extremely low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Israeli hospitals: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Homeless shelters are high risk settings for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) have high rates of chronic illness, and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The burden of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in PEH has not been well-studied and PEH may be uniquely affected due to barriers to medical care and the potential exacerbation of existing threats to health, housing, employment, and self-care. METHODS: The Seattle Flu Study conducted community-based surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in nine homeless shelters from September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Individuals with and without respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a PCR assay. We completed follow-up surveys with shelter residents age 18 years at days 5, 10, 30 and 60+ after positive or inconclusive diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals were asked about residual symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, access to medical care, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Of 51 eligible participants, 22 (43%) completed a follow-up survey, with six at day 5 or 10 survey, 11 at day 30, and 18 at day 60+. The median time from enrollment to last follow-up survey was 77 (range 49-138) days. Five (23%) participants reported at least one symptom at day 0, five (83%) at day 5 or 10, eight (73%) at day 30 and seven (39%) at day 60+ (Figure 1). Eight (36%) reported at least one symptom on a day 30 or 60+ follow up survey that interfered or prevented their daily activities. Nine (41%) received medical care at the quarantine facility. Of those with symptoms persisting beyond day 10, four (30%) received medical care outside of a medical provider at the quarantine facility. [Image: see text] Prevalence of self-reported symptoms at Day 0 (enrollment), Day 5 or 10, Day 30, and Day 60+ in shelter residents who tested positive or inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: PEH reported a high prevalence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms 30+ days after their SARS-CoV-2 detection. Few participants accessed medical care for their persistent illness. The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond acute illness and PASC may exacerbate existing challenges PEH face in health and wellbeing. DISCLOSURES: Helen Y.

We aimed to assess the incidence and lethality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different organ transplant settings using the liver as a comparator. Methods: In this nationwide population-based study we compared the crude incidence and lethality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection [95% Bonferroni adjusted CI (Ba-CI)] among Italian LTRs as compared to non-liver SOTRs and to general population. The following independent groups had been compared: Italian general population, all SOTRs, liver transplant recipients (LTRs) and non-Liver SOTRs in area with different incidence of infection. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and lethality rate ratio (LRR) was assessed. Community risk exposures in transplant settings were assessed. Results: From February 21 to June 22, 2020, there were 450 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections over 14168 LTRs (n=89) and 29815 non-liver SOTRs (n= 361). A significantly lower risk of infection [IRR 0.56 (Ba-CI 0.34-0.92), 0.45 (Ba-CI 0.26-0.79), 0.52 (Ba-CI 0.36-0.75)] and a lower lethality rate ratio [(LRR 0.61 (Ba-CI 0.23-1.57), 0.37 (0.08-1.76), 0.52 (0.23-1.18] was found among LTRs as compared to non-liver SOTRs in the three areas. Excluding Lombardy, the risk of infection and lethality in LTRs was lower compared to general population. Non-Liver SOTRs showed an increased risk of infection and lethality at all geographic levels compared to general population. No significant difference in the adherence to mitigation policies was found. Conclusions: Liver transplantation was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lethality in respect to non-liver solid organ transplants.

Treatment was initiated with phenobarbital, zonisamide, and levetiracetam; however, the presumed seizure activity continued. Results of analysis of continuous electroencephalographic recording indicated the cat had nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Between the 12th of March and 17th of April 2020, all the symptomatic pregnancies were screened with diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Data collection was done by reviewing the medical records and telephone interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics, management, treatment, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients with positive COVID-19 diagnostic test out of thirty-four suspected. The most common symptoms were fever (70%), cough (65%) and myalgia (35%).

We also assessed explicit motivation towards unhealthy snacks using food selection tasks. We examined whether labelling effects on motivation arose from the creation of outcome-dependent associations between the food and its health consequences or from simple, non-specific aversive associations. Both label types reduced motivation towards snack foods but only when the label was physically present. HWLs and IALs showed similar effects on implicit motivation, although HWLs reduced explicit motivation more than IALs. Thus, aversive HWLs appear to act both through low level associative mechanisms affecting implicit motivation, and by additionally emphasizing explicit causal links to health outcomes thereby affecting explicitly motivated choice behaviours.","output":"Effect of health warning labels on motivation towards energy-dense snack foods: Two experimental studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel quinolone derivatives have been designed and readily synthesized according to a simple protocol including O-alkylation and Claisen rearrangement processes.

Non-immunostimulated piglets transfected with the viral clone did not present clinical signs but only mild pathological microlesions characteristic of PMWS. These piglets seroconverted and high viral genome loads and infectious titers were detected in the lymphoid organs at the end of the trial. Mild-to-moderate forms of PMWS were generally observed in the immunostimulated transfected piglets, as well as one severe form for a piglet (8003) which died. These piglets with mild-to-moderate forms had higher DNA loads than the transfected-only animals. Thus, viral replication was enhanced by immunostimulation. This is the first time that clinical PMWS has been reported in an SPF immunostimulated piglet infected with a pure inoculum consisting of tandem-cloned PCV2 DNA.

Community pharmacists provide community pharmacy services and can play a vital role in fighting the pandemic by taking on novel roles that complement their pre-existing roles. Objectives To provide a scoping review of current and emerging literature about the novel roles adopted by community pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Online databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed were searched systematically using the keywords COVID-19, AND pharmacist, AND community. Articles were selected based on availability of full text in English language, with time limit from 1st December 2019 to 31st October 2021; case reports, cross-sectional studies, literature reviews, qualitative studies and systematic reviews were included while commentary reviews and editorials were excluded from the search methodology. An independent review of the articles was carried out for inclusion based on relatability to study subject; those chosen were screened for references to find additional gray literature. Findings were arranged in themes and the results were organized accordingly. Results Novel roles for community pharmacists were found in relation to maintenance of drug supply chains; delivery of tele-pharmacy and telehealth services; provision of ambulatory pharmacy services; use of digital software to coordinate medication delivery for patients with chronic conditions; dispelling of misinformation; and roles in research and clinical trials.

Recent trials demonstrated the effectiveness of endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial occlusions; however, most studies excluded patients with TOs. METHODS Retrospective review of prospectively collected thrombectomy databases from 3 stroke centers between 2011 and 2015. Consecutive patients with tandem extracranial steno-occlusive carotid disease and intracranial occlusions who underwent emergent thrombectomy were selected. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed; baseline and procedural variables were included in univariate and multivariate analyses to define the independent predictors of good outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale 2). RESULTS A total of 100 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 64.4  12.5, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 17.6  5.0, time from last known well to puncture 7.3  5.8 h, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 7.5  1.6. Forty percent received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Intracranial occlusion sites included: internal carotid artery thrombus, 31%; middle cerebral artery (MCA)-M1, 53%; MCA-M2, 10%; and anterior cerebral artery, 6%. Good outcome was achieved in 42% and successful reperfusion modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI 2B) in 88% of the cases, including complete (mTICI 3) reperfusion in 40%. Severe parenchymal hematoma (PH)-2 occurred in 6% of the patients and 90-day mortality was 20%.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and tunnel-cuffed venous catheters (tCVC) are commonly used vascular access routes and have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. This study focuses on the effects of AVFs and tCVCs on morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS The records (between January 2015 and January 2017) of 110 patients (55 patients with AVF and 55 patients with tCVC) under hemodialysis therapy for at least 6 months were evaluated retrospectively. The data about blood tests, hospitalizations, and mortality were compared between patients with AVF and tCVC. FINDINGS Fifty-five patients (25 male, 58  14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via AVF. Fifty-five patients (17 male, 63  14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via tunneled CVCs. Thirty (54.5%) of the hospitalization patients had AVF and 46 (83.6%) had CVCs (p < 0.01). The only independent predictor of hospitalization was the use of tCVC as vascular access, according to multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.01). Seven (30%) of the dead patients had AVF and 16 (69.6%) had CVCs (p = 0.035). Use of tCVC appeared to be a mortality predictor in univariate regression analysis (p = 0.039). But the significance did not continue in multivariate model (p = 0.578) in which the duration of hemodialysis appeared as the only significant factor (p = 0.002).

The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic. Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the COVID-19 virus origin by using artificial intelligence (AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined COVID-19 virus genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidences strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the COVID-19 virus. At the whole genome analysis level, our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.","output":"Origin of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Computational Biology Study using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antifungal peptides are effective, biocompatible, and biodegradable, and thus, they are promising to be the next generation of drugs for treating infections caused by fungi.

This research provides quantitative molecular understanding of the role of the DES thickness and also the type of solid support in CO2 sorption and diffusion using molecular dynamics simulations. In general, the proposed model based on supported DESs immobilized on different supports was developed to correlate the solubility of CO2 in DESs based on choline chloride. The simulated systems illustrate that CO2 molecules mainly accumulate at the gas/DES interface in short times, whereas diffusion of CO2 to the bulk DESs is slower as the thickness of the immobilized DES increases. In addition, the CO2 absorption capacity of both DESs coated on the TiO2 surface is larger than that on the graphite surface. Structural and dynamic characteristics were determined using density profiles, distribution functions, orientational analysis, and mean-square displacements.

The fever persisted, the cough became more productive, and a plain chest X-ray showed slight a few infiltrative opacities in the right lung field. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated. The patient developed a right pneumothorax 5 days after the operation, and contaminated discharge from the right chest tube was noted. A chest computed tomography showed right-sided empyema, while bronchoscopic examination revealed no evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Open-window thoracostomy (OWT) was performed. Finally, 2 days after the OWT, the patient was diagnosed as having an EPF, because the right chest cavity was found to be contaminated with food materials. Ample purification of the right chest cavity was achieved by repeated dressing changes, and the EPF was finally closed by omentopexy. The post-surgical course was uneventful. Five weeks after the omentopexy, an esophagogram revealed no leakage of the contrast medium from the esophageal wall. The patient was discharged 13 weeks after the omentopexy. CONCLUSION While EPF following pulmonary resection is a rare complication, it can lead to critical situations and the diagnosis is difficult.

Health care worker (HCWs) are at a significant risk of infection which may cause high levels of psychological distress. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 on HCWs and factors which were associated with these stresses during the first outbreak in Shanghai. Methods: Between February 9 and 21, 2020, a total of 3,114 frontline HCWs from 26 hospitals in Shanghai completed an online survey. The questionnaire included questions on their sociodemographic characteristics, 15 stress-related questions, and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the 15 stress-related questions which produced four distinct factors for evaluation. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore the association of personal characteristics with each score of the four factors. Binary logistic analysis was used to explain the association of personal characteristics and these four factors with the GHQ-12. Results: There were 2,691 valid surveys received. The prevalence of emotional distress (defined as GHQ-12 &#8805; 12) was noted in 47.7% (95%CI:45.7-49.6%) HCWs. Females (OR = 1.43, 95%CI:1.09-1.86) were more likely to have a psychological distress than males. However, HCWs who work in secondary hospitals (OR = 0.71, 95% CI:0.58-0.87) or had a no contact history (OR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.35-0.58) were less likely to suffer psychological distress. HCWs who were nurses, married, and had a known contact history were highly likely to have anxiety. HCWs working at tertiary hospitals felt an elevated anxiety regarding the infection, a lack of knowledge, and less protected compared to those who worked at secondary hospitals. Conclusions: Our study shows that the frontline HCWs had a significant psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai. HCWs felt a lack of knowledge and had feelings of being not protected.

While PCR remains the frontline test of choice in the acute diagnostic setting, serological tests are urgently needed to fulfil the other requirements. Unlike PCR tests which are highly specific for each virus, cross-reactivity could potentially be a major challenge for COVID-19 antibody tests considering there are six other coronaviruses known to infect humans.

The putative mechanism involves formation of pathological anti-PF4 antibodies that activate platelets via the FcRIIa receptor to drive thrombosis and the associated thrombocytopenia. Functional assays are important in the VITT diagnostic pathway as not all detectable PF4 antibodies are pathogenic. Detection of procoagulant platelets (platelets supporting thrombin generation) in presence of PF4 has been proposed as a diagnostic assay for VITT (Althaus et al). Procoagulant platelets are not typically generated in response to low level agonist stimulation;however, combination of ligand binding of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) (eg. PAR1) and ITAM linked receptors (eg. GPVI, CLEC2 and FcRIIa) synergistically induce procoagulant platelet formation. Here, we describe an alternative flow cytometric assay to diagnose VITT. We hypothesized that priming of platelets with a PAR1 agonist at a level sufficient to release PF4, but insufficient to generate a significant procoagulant response in donor platelets, would provide a platform in which procoagulant response would be dependent on presence of FcRIIa dependent procoagulant antibodies in patient plasma, without requirement for additional PF4. Methods: Our previously established flow cytometry-based procoagulant platelet assay (using cell death marker GSAO and P-selectin) was modified to incorporate exogenous patient plasma and performed on whole blood from healthy donors screened for FcRIIa responsiveness (aggregation response to anti-CD9 antibody, ALB6), primed with 5 M SFLLRN. The assay was performed on Australian patients referred for confirmatory VITT testing with probable VITT (confirmed thrombosis within 4-42 days of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination, D-Dimer > 5x ULN, platelets < 150 x 10 9/L or falling platelet count) after screening on PF4/heparin ELISA (Asserachrom HPIA IgG Assay, Stago Diagnostics). Procoagulant response was also measured in presence of 0.5 U/mL and 100 U/mL heparin, monoclonal FcRIIa blocking antibody, IV.3, and intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIg. Some plasmas were incubated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Flow cytometry positive patients were also tested by serotonin release assay (SRA) and multiplate aggregometry. Clinical correlation was obtained. Results: Citrated plasma from 49 unique patients with suspected VITT are reported. Plasma from ELISA+ve patients with clinical picture consistent with VITT (n=31), significantly increased the procoagulant platelet proportions in healthy donors in presence of 5 M SFLLRN (p<0.0001, Figure 1A). This increase was not seen with plasma from healthy donors (n=14);or individuals exposed to ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine without VITT: thrombocytopenic thrombosis patients who were ELISA-ve and SRA-ve (n=14);or low-level ELISA+ve patients without thrombocytopenia who were negative by either multiplate or SRA (n=4). The procoagulant platelet response induced by VITT positive plasma was reduced with low dose heparin (0.5 U/mL, p<0.01) except for 3 patients who showed a heparin-enhancing effect (Figure 1B). High dose heparin (100 U/mL, p<0.0001), IV.3 (10 g/mL, p<0.0001) or IVIg (10 mg/mL, p<0.0001) abolished the procoagulant response (Figures 1C-D). The in vitro effect of IVIg was predictive of the in vivo response to IVIg therapy (Figure 1E). Addition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had no effect on the procoagulant platelet response. ChAdOx1 nCov-19 had an inconsistent effect on procoagulant platelet formation in presence of VITT plasma. Use of donors without a robust aggregation response to ALB6 resulted in false negative results. Conclusion: Induction of FcRIIa dependent procoagulant response by patient plasma, suppressible by high dose heparin and IVIg, is highly indicative of VITT in the correct clinical circumstance. This assay modification of priming donor platelets from known FcRIIa responsive donors ith a GPCR agonist to potentiate the ITAM signaling from platelet activating immune complexes, results in a sensitive and specific assay. This may represent a functional platform that can be adopted into diagnostic laboratories to identify patients with platelet-activating antibodies and potentially predict treatment responses.

Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Job stress questionnaire (JSQ), and questionnaires of hospital resources, family support, and measuring the fear of COVID-19 were used as research instruments. RESULTS: The scores of job stress and burnout in the exposure group with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher than in the non-exposure group (p=0.006 and p=0.002, respectively).

Duration of treatment and transfusion parameters, medical record, laboratory testing, concomitant medication, and survival rate, were assessed for every episode. Results During the study period, 12 (55.5 %) and 10 (45.5 %) new cases were treated with QP and MBP, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of TPE processes, days elapsed from diagnosis to TPE, and plasma volume transfused. The QP TPE episodes of treatment were significantly associated with an increased time to recovery compared with MBP episodes of treatment (p = 0.004). Conclusion MBP was as effective as QP in the treatment of TTP patients. Since recovery was more favourable when MBP was used, we consider MBP remains a suitable alternative to treat TTP patients.","output":"Methylene blue-treated plasma, versus quarantine fresh frozen plasma, for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treatment: Comparison between centres and critical review on longitudinal data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common and critical viral pathogen causing acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children and has a huge disease burden worldwide. At present, there are many studies on RSV transcriptomics exploring the mechanism of disease, but different studies show different gene expression patterns and results due to different sample collection platforms and data analysis strategies. A meta-analysis was performed on eight whole blood transcriptome datasets containing 436 children with acute RSV infection and 241 healthy children. A total of 319 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (P value <0.0001) were identified in a meta-analysis using a random effect model. Functional enrichment analysis showed that several pathways related to immunity were significantly altered, including the chemokine signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and cytokineCcytokine receptor interaction. Immune cell type analysis showed that the proportion of neutrophils in most RSV-infected children was higher than that in healthy children.

Our model contains at most two fitting parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data, which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first \`Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people, taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population) have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world economy.","output":"A simple iterative map forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. SETTING: The Louisiana Health Sciences Center C New Orleans Institutional Review Board and the University Medical Center Clinical Research Review Committee approved the study protocol. DATA ACQUISITION: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during March (March 1st through March 31st) 2020 at the University Medical Center New Orleans (UMCNO), who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same hospitalization. The EMR team generated a list of 257 patients admitted for COVID-19. We excluded seven patients because of a negative COVID-19 test result or incomplete medical record documentation. Three neurology residents (DC, MS, DB) reviewed the EMR in detail to capture the relevant medical history, clinical course, and laboratory test results and abstracted data into an electronic data collection spreadsheet. We recorded the presentation or development of the following neurological complaints: headache, syncope, altered mental status, seizure, status epilepticus, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We used \\"R\\" (statistics software) and Microsoft Excel to generate summary tables. To analyse hospital length of stay or death, we fitted a competing risks proportional hazards model for time to discharge or death using the crr() function in R version 4.0.0. The competing risks model allowed the analysis of hospital stay, taking into account that the censoring of cases due to death was not random. To predict the likelihood of intubation, we used the glm() function in R to fit a logistic regression model. For each model, we determined baseline demographic variables predictive of the outcomes and generated adjusted models.

Through an established academic-practice partnership, pre-licensure nursing students were able to fill this new Patient Services Aid role. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the students' experiences in this mutually beneficial innovative role. METHODS: Electronic surveys and qualitative focus groups were used to evaluate the students' experiences. RESULTS: A total of 34 students were employed at the health system as PSAs. Focus groups (n = 16) analysis showed that, while the role was not a substitute for academic clinical experiences, they did improve the students' confidence in the clinical setting and helped teach necessary non-technical skills. Students appreciated the ability to network with multiple disciplines while working as PSAs. CONCLUSIONS: This role was developed to assist with immediate COVID-19 needs; however, this model of using pre-licensure students in non-clinical roles can improve students' non-technical skills and confidence in the clinical setting. The success of the activity was due to the strong relationships between the School of Nursing and health system.

Due to early reports during the COVID-pandemic showing dramatic improvements in oxygenation, the use of prone position has been broadly adopted in intubated patients around the globe. However, it remains unclear on whether titration of ventilation should be reassessed when the patient is repositioned. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the response of respiratory mechanics in supine and prone positions during a decremental end-expiratory positive pressure trial in COVID-19 related ARDS patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 related ARDS under invasive mechanical ventilation in supine and prone positions. The study was approved by the Investigational Review Board at the Massachusetts General Hospital and by the Ethics and Research Committee at Heart Institute (InCor) from the University of S?o Paulo. Prone position was recommended based on hypoxia, measured as PaO2/FIO2 ratio (&lt; 150 mmHg). Patients were sedated, and under volume-controlled ventilation (5-6 mL/Kg PBW). Airway pressure, flow, esophageal pressure and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) were recorded. A decremental PEEP trial was performed on supine and prone position. RESULTS: We included 10 patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. Median age was 62 years (range, 35-72), 5 patients (50%) were female, and BMI was 35 (range, 27-46). After 24 hours of intubation, median PaO2/FIO2 was 174 mmHg (IQR, 166-192), PEEP was 10 cmH2O (IQR, 10-14.5), and static compliance of respiratory system (CRS) was 28.5 mL/cmH2O (IQR, 24.2-35.7). The time interval between intubation and the supine-prone assessment was 7 days (IQR, 5-10). During the supine/prone assessment, a variety of CRS responses were observed among patients (Figure 1). Overall, the highest CRS was 44 mL/cmH2O (IQR, 29-57) in supine and 52 mL/cmH2O (IQR, 39-67) in prone position. At the highest CRS, from supine to prone position: lung compliance (CL) increased by 15 mL/cmH2O (IQR, 13-31), suggesting lung recruitment, and chest wall compliance (CCW) was reduced by 28 ml/cmH2O (IQR, 14-48) indicating external compression of the chest;and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (PLend-exp) increased from-3.4 cmH2O (IQR,-4.6 to-2.5) to 0.4 cmH2O (IQR, 0.1-3.0) suggesting decreased pleural pressure. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 related ARDS assessed in supine and prone positions revels a variety response to prone position on CRS during decremental PEEP trial, suggesting the necessity to reassess the PEEP when the patient is repositioned.

During the lockdown caused by this disease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all industries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19 is to provide a reliable solution for people's health assessment. In this article, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and validates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society. For this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features in protecting people's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests against the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an integrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different people's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications. In this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are responsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the system controller. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the system. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC tokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this mechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system controller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can send these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the encrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate platform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable and accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the requirements.","output":"A Secure and Efficient Approach for Issuing KYC Token As COVID-19 Health Certificate Based on Stellar Blockchain Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nebulised antibiotics are habitually used in patients with bronchiectasis, but the use of dry powder inhaled antibiotics (DPIA) in these patients is extremely limited. This study seeks to analyse the efficacy and safety of DPIA in bronchiectasis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-centre study of historic cohorts. All the hospital centres in Spain were contacted in order to collect data on patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis who had taken at least one dose of DPIA. Its efficacy was analysed in clinical, functional and microbiological terms by comparing the year before and the year after the prescription of DPIA. Adverse effects and variables associated with these effects, or any need to withdraw the drug, were also analysed. RESULTS 164 patients from 33 Spanish centres were included; 86% and 14% of these were treated with dry powder colistin and tobramycin, respectively. Chronic bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 86% of these patients, and DPIA significantly reduced the number of exacerbations, the quantity and purulence of sputum and the isolation of pathogenic microorganisms. The most common adverse effect was cough (40%), particularly in cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and a previous cough and in those patients who had difficulties in handling the device. These factors were associated with a higher level of withdrawal of the treatment. There were no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that DPIA are clinically efficacious and safe for treating bronchiectasis patients.

A great amount of epidemiological detail was reported that not only distinguishes the various stages and complications of whooping cough, but also reveals unique immunological aspects of this disease. The first of these epidemics is the oldest recorded whooping cough epidemic. On the basis of epidemiological features, we propose that this whooping cough epidemic was the first to have taken place in Persia and might have been part of the first pandemic. This theory pushes back the date of first documented emergence of whooping cough by almost a century, which matches molecular data about its spread.

No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated.

In Australia, the federal government has entered into three agreements for the supply of vaccines, with roll-out beginning for the highest priority groups in February 2021. Expansion of the vaccination program throughout February and March failed to meet government targets and this has been attributed to international supply issues. However, Australia has local capacity to manufacture one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine weekly and once fully operational this will greatly increase the national vaccination capacity. Under current plans, these vaccine doses will be distributed primarily through a network of general practices, to be joined in later phases by community pharmacies. It remains unclear whether these small distribution venues have the logistical capacity to administer vaccines at the rate they will become available. To inform this discussion, we applied stochastic queue network models to estimate the capacity of vaccination sites based on assumptions about appointment schedules, service times and available staff numbers. We specified distinct queueing models for two delivery modes: (i) mass vaccination hubs located in hospitals or sports arenas and (ii) smaller clinics situated in general practices or community pharmacies. Based on our assumed service times, the potential daily throughput for an eight hour clinic at a mass vaccination hub ranged from around 500 vaccinations for a relatively small hub to 1,400 vaccinations a day for a relatively large hub. For GP vaccination clinics, the estimated daily throughput ranged from about 100 vaccinations a day for a relatively small practice to almost 300 a day for a relatively large practice. Stress tests showed that for both delivery modes, sites with higher staff numbers were more robust to system pressures, such as increased arrivals or staff absences, and mass vaccination sites were more robust that GP clinics. Our analysis is accompanied by an interactive web-based queue simulation applet, which allows users to explore queue performance under their own assumptions regarding appointments, service times and staff availability. Different vaccine delivery modes offer distinct benefits and may be particularly appealing to specific population segments. A combination of expanded mass vaccination hubs and expanded GP vaccination is likely to achieve mass vaccination faster than either mode alone.","output":"Modelling vaccination capacity at mass vaccination hubs and general practice clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that there is seasonal variation in the rates of gestational diabetes (GDM) diagnosed using a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test.

The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group.

Thus, the present study is aimed at investigating the influence of T stage on the predictive value of tumor size in clinical stage ICIV esophageal cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) cancer registry program. Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized to identify the independent prognostic ability of the factor. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the distribution of survival outcome. Harrell's concordance index (c-index) was used to quantify the predictive ability of the prognostic model and prognostic factor. RESULTS: According to the T stage, subgroup analysis showed that tumor size was not an independent risk factor in T3 and T4 stage esophageal cancer patients. Furthermore, the predictive power of tumor size was negatively impacted by the increase in T stage. Furthermore, the discriminative ability of the Cox model based on the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system with tumor size outperformed the model based on the TNM system only. CONCLUSION: The current study identified tumor size as a critical clinical prognostic signature for esophageal cancer with considerable discriminatory ability and prognostic value. Therefore, tumor size should be included in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging of T1-2 esophagus cancer patients.","output":"Tumor Size as a Critical Prognostic Factor in T1-2 Stage Esophageal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We surveyed three well-established store-and-forward telemedicine networks to identify any changes during the first half of 2020, which might have been due to the effect of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on their telemedicine operations The three networks all used the Collegium Telemedicus system Various quantitative performance indicators, which included the numbers of referrals and the case-mix, were compared with their values in previous years Two of the three networks surveyed (A and B) provided telemedicine services for any type of medical or surgical case, while the third (network C) handled only pediatric radiology cases All networks operated in Africa, but networks A and C also provided services in other resource-constrained regions Two of the networks (networks B and C) used local staff to submit referrals, while network A relied mainly on its expatriate staff During the first half of 2020, the numbers of referrals received on network B increased substantially, while in contrast, the numbers of referrals on network A declined All three networks had relatively stable referral rates during 2018 and 2019 All three networks delivered a service that was rated highly by the referrers One network operated at relatively high efficiency compared to the other two, although it is not known if this is sustainable The networks which were more reliant on local referrers saw little reductionor even an increasein submitted cases, while the network that had the most dependence on international staff saw a big fall in submitted cases This was probably due to the effect of international travel restrictions on the deployment of its staff We conclude that organizations wanting to build or expand their telemedicine services should consider deliberately empowering local providers as their referrers [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Telemedicine & Applications is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Referral Activity in Three Store-and-Forward Networks during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays an important role in bacterial and viral infections.

The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in emergency medicine, but so far, no studies have evaluated its use in patients with covid-19. We aimed to study the performance of NEWS2 and compare commonly used clinical risk stratification tools at admission to predict risk of severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic; 13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9th to April 27th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores 5 and  6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score  2, 2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score  2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLongs test. RESULTS: In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score  6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% CI 0.690C0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score  2 (AUC 0.624, 95% CI 0.446C0.810, p < 0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. CONCLUSION: NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19.","output":"National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission predicts severe disease and in-hospital mortality from Covid-19 C a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study evaluates the return and volatility transmission between the health and tourism stocks The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic brought about an unprecedented crisis in the global health and financial market with the tourism sector being among the largest casualty as it experiences an almost total collapse as a result of economic lockdowns and movement restrictions, while the health sector witnessed considerable boom We employ the VARMACCCC-AGARCH model, based on the conducted preliminary tests, on daily data collected for health and tourism stocks proxied using the Dow Jones US sector indices between January 02, 2018 and July 09, 2020 The empirical estimation is also partitioned into full sample, before and during Covid-19 periods to elicit the impact of the pandemic outbreak We further examine the optimal weights of holding health and tourism stocks and compute the hedging ratios in the presence of health risks Our empirical findings show evidence of significant negative bidirectional returns spillover transmission between the health and tourism sectors particularly during the Covid-19 period In addition, the hedge ratios further confirmed the hedging effectiveness of health stocks for risks associated with tourism stocks which is also more noticeable in the pandemic period Essentially, our results show that a diversified asset portfolio that includes health together with tourism stocks may improve risk-adjusted return performance for investors especially during pandemics","output":"Volatility spillovers and hedging effectiveness between health and tourism stocks: Empirical evidence from the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The New York City (NYC) youth shelter system is instrumental in providing housing, counseling, and other support services to runaway and homeless youth and young adults (RHY).

In this study, we evaluated antibody responses to 2 doses mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in allogeneic HSCT recipients. METHODS We retrospectively enrolled successive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients across France who completed the 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) between January 1 st and July 15 th 2021. All included patients had an available semi-quantitative antispike serologic testing after the second dose (from Roche, DiaSorin, Abbott or Siemens). We excluded patients with a prior COVID-19 confirmed by serology or PCR. For detectable antibody, we calculated the binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/mL) according to the WHO International Standard by applying conversion factors given by the manufacturers (Kristiansen et al. , The Lancet 2021). Antibody response was categorized as weak or good with a threshold of 264 BAU/mL which has been associated to an estimate of 80% of mRNA vaccine-induced protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in immunocompetent patients (Feng S. et al., medRxiv 2021). We built a multivariate logistic regression model to assess factors independently associated with the absence of antibody response after the second dose of mRNA vaccination. RESULTS Overall, 620 allogeneic HSCT recipients from 12 hospitals across France were included in the analysis (60% male with a median age of 59 years old [IQR 47-66]), most with a myeloid (69%) or lymphoid (26%) malignancies. Donors were matched unrelated for 51%, HLA-identical sibling for 31% and haplo-identical for 18%. Thirty-one percent of HSCT recipients underwent a myeloablative conditioning, while 69% received a reduced intensity conditioning. The two doses of vaccines were given one month apart and the median time between transplantation and the initiation of vaccination was 29 months [IQR 14-58]. At a median of 33 [IQR 27-50] days after dose 2, an antibody response was detectable in 496 patients (80% [95CI: 77 to 83%]). Median [IQR] antibody levels was 243 BAU/mL [29.4-1391]. We classified detectable antibody responses as weak in 189 patients (30% [95CI 27 to 34%]) and as good in 306 (49% [95CI: 45 to 53%]). In the multivariate analysis including 533 patients (420 with detectable antibodies), factors associated with the absence of humoral responses were a time-interval from HSCT < 12 months (ajusted Odds-Ratio (aOR) 2.8 [95CI 1.6 to 4.8]), absolute lymphocyte count <1G/L (aOR 3.0 [95CI 1.7 to 5.0]), systemic immunosuppressive treatments within 3 months of vaccination (aOR 4.5 [95CI 2.7 to 7.5]), together with the use of rituximab within 6 months (aOR 15.1 [95CI 4.3 to 52.7]). In a subsequent multivariate analysis conducted a subset of 227 patients (170 with detectable antibodies) with available gammaglobulinemia as well as B and T lymphocytes counts, factors remaining associated with the absence of antibody response were only low B-lymphocytes count (aOR 5.5 [95CI 2.4 to 12.3]) and time-interval from HSCT < 12 months (aOR 3.3 [95CI 1.5 to 7.2]). CONCLUSION After 2 dose mRNA vaccination, the majority of allogeneic HSCT recipients developed an antibody response although a significant proportion of these responses may be insufficient. Studies are still needed to investigate the effect of a third vaccine dose in patients with a null or weak humoral response.

Thus, reducing negative effects that influenced many industrial sectors, especially healthcare. Artificial intelligence techniques in particular deep learning could help in the fast and precise diagnosis of coronavirus from computed tomography images. Most artificial intelligence-based studies used the original computed tomography images to build their models;however, the integration of texture-based radiomics images and deep learning techniques could improve the diagnostic accuracy of the novel coronavirus diseases. This study proposes a computer-assisted diagnostic framework based on multiple deep learning and texture-based radiomics approaches. It first trains three Residual Networks (ResNets) deep learning techniques with two texture-based radiomics images including discrete wavelet transform and gray-level covariance matrix instead of the original computed tomography images. Then, it fuses the texture-based radiomics deep features sets extracted from each using discrete cosine transform. Thereafter, it further combines the fused texture-based radiomics deep features obtained from the three convolutional neural networks. Finally, three support vector machine classifiers are utilized for the classification procedure. The proposed method is validated experimentally on the benchmark severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 computed tomography image dataset. The accuracies attained indicate that using texture-based radiomics (gray-level covariance matrix, discrete wavelet transform) images for training the ResNet-18 (83.22%, 74.9%), ResNet-50 (80.94%, 78.39%), and ResNet-101 (80.54%, 77.99%) is better than using the original computed tomography images (70.34%, 76.51%, and 73.42%) for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F1-score achieved using the proposed computer-assisted diagnostic after the two fusion steps are 99.47%, 99.72%, 99.60%, 99.72%, and 99.60% which proves that combining texture-based radiomics deep features obtained from the three ResNets has boosted its performance. Thus, fusing multiple texture-based radiomics deep features mined from several convolutional neural networks is better than using only one type of radiomics approach and a single convolutional neural network.

We hypothesized that MR imaging 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics would reveal distinct blood flow patterns in the venous outflow tract in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with pulsatile tinnitus of suspected venous etiology underwent MR imaging at 3T, using venous phase contrast-enhanced MR angiography, 4D flow, and 2D phase contrast. The contrast-enhanced MRA contours were evaluated to determine the presence and extent of a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed using the 4D flow inlet flow and the luminal contours from contrast-enhanced MRA as boundary conditions. In addition, computational fluid dynamics was performed for the expected post treatment conditions by smoothing the venous geometry to exclude the sigmoid sinus diverticulum from the anatomic boundary conditions. Streamlines were generated from the 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics velocity maps, and flow patterns were examined for the presence of rotational components. RESULTS Twenty-five patients with pulsatile tinnitus of suspected venous etiology and 10 control subjects were enrolled. Five (20%) of the symptomatic subjects had sigmoid sinus diverticula, all associated with an upstream stenosis. In each of these patients, but none of the controls, a stenosis-related flow jet was directed toward the opening of the sigmoid sinus diverticulum with rotational flow patterns in the sigmoid sinus diverticulum and parent sigmoid sinus on both 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics. CONCLUSIONS Consistent patterns of blood flow can be visualized in a sigmoid sinus diverticulum and the parent sinus using 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics.

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

The cDNA clones representing the 3'-terminal genomic RNA of the virus were isolated and sequenced. The genome is a positive-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with an estimated size of 15 kb. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified three complete open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to encode polypeptides with predicted M(r)s of 22.2K (ORF 5), 19.1K (ORF 6) and 13.6K (ORF 7). ORF 7, which is closest to the 3' end, is predicted to encode a highly basic nucleocapsid protein displaying 58% amino acid identity to the corresponding protein of the Lelystad virus (LV), a European PRRSV isolate. ORFs 6 and 5, preceding ORF 7, are each predicted to encode proteins containing several hydrophobic domains that are thought to be membrane-associated. The VR 2385 ORF 6 protein is the most conserved structural protein. It has 78% amino acid identity to the equivalent LV protein, and ORF 5 shares only 54% of its amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3'-coterminal nested set of six subgenomic RNAs in VR 2385 virus-infected CRL 11171 cells. Our results indicate that VR 2385, like LV, is a member of the newly proposed arterivirus group.

The study thus aimed at quantifying and mapping the scientific output of EVD research published within 2010-2020 though a bibliometric perspective. METHODS: EVD-related publications from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases by using the keywords Ebola', Ebola Virus Disease', Ebolas', and ebolavirus'. Biblioshiny software (using R-studio cloud) was used to categorise and evaluate authors', countries' and journals' contribution. VOSviewer was used for network visualisation. RESULTS: According to the used search strategy, a total of 3865 and 3848 EVD documents were published in WoS and Scopus, respectively. The average citation per document was 16.1 (WoS) and 16.3 (Scopus). The results show an overall increase in the publication trend within the study period. The leading countries in EVD research were the USA and UK, with over 100 papers in both databases, including Nigeria and South Africa.

Although angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, immunopathological changes in severe cancer patients support the investigation of additional potential receptors such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a key immunoregulator.

We used the Wells-Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells-Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection.","output":"A probabilistic transmission dynamic model to assess indoor airborne infection risks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For RNA viruses, rapid viral evolution and the biological similarity of closely related host species have been proposed as key determinants of the occurrence and long-term outcome of cross-species transmission.

We aim to estimate the incremental cost per health outcome of PrEP compared with placebo, no PrEP, or other HIV prevention strategies; assess the methodological variability in, and quality of, economic evaluations of PrEP; estimate the incremental cost per health outcome of different PrEP implementation strategies; and quantify the potential sources of heterogeneity in outcomes. METHODS We will systematically search electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase) and the gray literature. We will include economic evaluation studies that assess both costs and health outcomes of PrEP in HIV-uninfected individuals, without restricting language or year of publication. Two reviewers will independently screen studies using predefined inclusion criteria, extract data, and assess methodological quality using the Philips checklist, Second Panel on the Cost-effectiveness of Health and Medicines, and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research recommendations. Outcomes of interest include incremental costs and outcomes in natural units or utilities, cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefit. We will perform descriptive and quantitative syntheses using sensitivity analyses of outcomes by population subgroups, HIV epidemic settings, study designs, baseline intervention contexts, key parameter inputs and assumptions, type of outcomes, economic perspectives, and willingness to pay values. DISCUSSION Findings will guide future economic evaluation of PrEP strategies in terms of methodological and knowledge gaps, and will inform decisions on the efficient integration of PrEP into public health programs across epidemiologic and health system contexts.

METHODS From April 2008 to October 2013, 66 pancreatic resections were performed at the Iwakuni Clinical Center. The milk test has been routinely conducted at the institute whenever possible during pancreatectomy. The milk test comprises the following procedure: A nasogastric tube is inserted until the third portion of the duodenum, followed by injection of 100 mL of milk through the tube. If a chyle leak is present, the patient tests positive in this milk test based on the observation of a white milky discharge. Positive milk test rates, leakage sites, and chylous ascites incidence were examined. LigaSure? (LS; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), a vessel-sealing device, is routinely used in pancreatectomy. Positive milk test rates before and after use of LS, as well as drain discharge volume at the 2(nd) and 3(rd) postoperative days, were compared retrospectively. Finally, positive milk test rates and chylous ascites incidence were compared with the results of a previous report. RESULTS Fifty-nine milk tests were conducted during pancreatectomy. The positive milk test rate for all pancreatectomy cases was 13.6% (8 of 59 cases). One case developed postoperative chylous ascites (2.1% among the pancreatoduedenectomy cases and 1.7% among all pancreatectomies). Positive rates by procedure were 12.8% for pancreatoduodenectomy and 22.2% for distal pancreatectomy. Positive rates by disease were 17.9% for pancreatic and 5.9% for biliary diseases. When comparing results from before and after use of LS, positive milk test rates in pancreatoduodenectomy were 13.0% before and 12.5% after, while those in distal pancreatectomy were 33.3% and 0%. Drainage volume tended to decrease when LS was used on the 3(rd) postoperative day (volumes were 424  303 mL before LS and 285  185 mL after, P = 0.056).

OBJECTIVE This review aimed to summarize the evidence regarding patient portal use (portals that are connected to electronic health care records) or patient portal functionality use (eg, appointment booking and e-messaging) and their reported associations with health and health care quality outcomes among adult patients with diabetes. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases and reported the review methodology using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and two reviewers assessed the full texts of relevant studies and performed data extraction and quality assessments of the included studies. We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were summarized through narrative synthesis. RESULTS Twelve studies were included in this review. Five studies reported overall patient portal use and its association with diabetes health and health care quality outcomes. Six studies reported e-messaging or email use-associated outcomes, and two studies reported prescription refill-associated outcomes. The reported health outcomes included the associations of patient portal use with blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and BMI. Few studies reported health care utilization outcomes such as office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. A limited number of studies reported overall quality of care for patients with diabetes who used patient portals.

In African American (AA) populations, COVID-19 presentations and outcomes are more severe. NIH and Interim WHO guidelines had suggested against the use of corticosteroids unless in clinical trials until the recent publication of the RECOVERY trial. Here, we analyzed the treatment effect of methylprednisolone on patients with AKI and ARDS during the initial 2 months of COVID-19 and detail the learning effect within our institution. METHODS: Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, 75 AA patients met our inclusion criteria for ARDS and AKI, of which 37 had received corticosteroids. Twenty-eight-day mortality, improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and renal function were analyzed. The impact of methylprednisolone treatment was assessed with multivariable methods. RESULTS: Survival in the methylprednisolone group reached 51% at 21 days compared to 29% in the non-corticosteroid group (P < .001). Methylprednisolone improved the likelihood of renal function improvement. PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in the methylprednisolone group improved by 73% compared to 45% in the non-corticosteroid group (P = .01). Age, gender, BMI, preexisting conditions, and other treatment factors did not show any impact on renal or PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio improvement. The use of anticoagulants, the month of treatment, and AKI during hospitalization also influenced outcomes. CONCLUSION: In AA COVID-19 positive patients with ARDS and AKI, IV methylprednisolone lowered the incidence of mortality and improved the likelihood of renal and lung function recovery.

The impact of this disease has, however, shown baffling variations in prevalence in different regions of the world. The aim of this short review is to identify differential national COVID-19 prevalence of COVID-19, as well as to suggest these epidemiological differences. Methods A review of studies was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Search tactics were centered on COVID-19 (COVID-19 AND coronavirus) and BCG vaccination (BCG vaccination OR Bacillus Calmette-Gurin OR vaccine) Results It is found that national prevalence differences may be linked with BCG childhood immunization history. A statistically insignificant difference was observed in COVID-19 prevalence when comparing countries with a BGC policy and countries without it (P> 0.05). This inconclusivity suggests the influence of confounders in this study. Conclusions National differences in COVID-19 cases can be attributable to immunologic regulations, such as BCG vaccination protocols. Caution should be taken in establishing a correlation between COVID-19 prevalence and BCG vaccination, partly due to the weak quality of statistical data on COVID-19 related to poor testing rates in countries with BCG vaccination policy. Nonetheless, the analysis of the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 will shed light on future efforts towards effective control and prevention.","output":"Epidemiological Differences of COVID-19 Over the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airlines have introduced a back-to-front boarding process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers' likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats. However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process or adopt the better random process.","output":"From Bad to Worse: Airline Boarding Changes in Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of motor imagery (MI) training on strength and power performances of professional athletes during a period of detraining caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Thirty male professional basketball players (age, 26.1  6.2 yr) were randomly assigned to three counterbalanced groups: two MI training groups, who completed imagery training by mentally rehearsing upper and lower limb resistance training exercises loaded with either 85% of one repetition maximum (85%1RM) or optimum power loads (OPL), or a control group. For six consecutive weeks, although all groups completed two weekly sessions of high-intensity running, only the MI groups performed three additional MI sessions a week. Maximal strength and power output were measured through 1RM and OPL assessments in the back squat and bench press exercises with a linear positioning transducer. Vertical jump and throwing capabilities were assessed with the countermovement jump and the seated medicine ball throw tests, respectively. Kinesthetic and visual imagery questionnaires, and chronometry and rating of perceived effort scores were collected to evaluate MI vividness, MI ability, and perceived effort. RESULTS: Physical performances improved significantly following both MI protocols (range, ~2% to ~9%), but were reduced in the control group, compared with preintervention (P  0.016). Moreover, interactions (time-protocol) were identified between the two MI groups (P  0.001). Whereas the 85%1RM led to greater effects on maximal strength measures than the OPL, the latter induced superior responses on measures of lower limb power. These findings were mirrored by corresponding cognitive and psychophysiological responses.

METHODS: Trained psychiatrists and nurses evaluated ICU patients for delirium, delirium subtypes, and anxiety. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to retrospectively analyze the data. Then, we compared the differences in the incidence of delirium, delirium subtypes, and anxiety level before and after the ICU visit ban. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the risk factors for delirium subtypes and high anxiety levels. RESULTS: After PSM, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of delirium between the non-visiting and restrictive visiting groups (non-visiting 27.4% versus restrictive visiting 30.9%, p = 0.162). The proportion of hyperactive and mixed subtypes was higher in the non-visiting than in the restrictive visiting group (non-visiting 35.3 and 30.1% versus restrictive visiting 27.7 and 20.1%, p = 0.002). The anxiety level was higher in the non-visiting than in the restrictive visiting group (state-trait anxiety inventory score: non-visiting 53.46  4.58 versus restrictive visiting 52.22  6.50, p = 0.009). Patients who stayed in the ICU during the visit ban were more likely to have hyperactive (p = 0.005) and mixed subtype (p = 0.001) than those who did not. Moreover, patients who stayed in the ICU during the visit ban were more likely to experience high anxiety levels than those who did not (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prohibition of ICU visits during COVID-19 pandemic did not affect the incidence of delirium during COVID-19 but could change the delirium subtype and raise anxiety level. Moreover, visiting prohibition was a risk factor for non-hypoactive delirium subtype and high anxiety levels.

This complication could be mitigated partially through early tendon mobilization. However, development of new treatment modalities to guide tissue regeneration and to reduce postsurgical tendon adhesion has recently gained attentions. In this article, synthesis and characterization of electrospun nanofibrous membranes (NFMs) of polycaprolactone (PCL) and chitosan to form a physical barrier against cellular migration leading to tendon adhesion is presented. The mechanical properties of the NFMs are modulated to maintain high integrity during postsurgical tendon mobilization. The tensile strength of the NFMs is examined in wet and dry conditions after 1000 cyclic pull loadings. In addition, the mechanical strength of the NFMs is evaluated after a degradation period of 30 days. To obtain NFM with desired properties, concentrations of polymer solutions, operation parameters of electrospinning and the thickness of NFMs were optimized. Based on the biodegradation and mechanical evaluations, the optimum NFM was obtained for specified amounts of PCL (5 wt %) + chitosan (2 wt %) at an electrospinning drum speed of 400 rpm. The engineered NFM could withstand forces of 33 and 19 N before and after 1000 pull cycles that are sufficient during tendon healing process. The bonding of chitosan fibers over PCL nanofibers allowed for production of NFMs with appropriate mechanical integrity and degradation rate.

Methods: In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to enhance abnormal chest x-ray (CXR) identification performance through segmentations. Our approach is designed in a cascaded manner and incorporates two modules: a deep neural network with criss-cross attention modules (XLSor) for localizing lung region in CXR images and a CXR classification model with a backbone of a self-supervised momentum contrast (MoCo) model pre-trained on large-scale CXR data sets. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on Shenzhen Hospital (SH) data set for the segmentation module, and COVIDx data set for both segmentation and classification modules. Novel statistical analysis is conducted in addition to regular evaluation metrics for the segmentation module. Furthermore, the results of the optimized approach are analyzed with gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to investigate the rationale behind the classification decisions and to interpret its choices. Results and Conclusion: Different data sets, methods, and scenarios for each module of the proposed pipeline are examined for designing an optimized approach, which has achieved an accuracy of 0.946 in distinguishing abnormal CXR images (i.e., Pneumonia and COVID-19) from normal ones. Numerical and visual validations suggest that applying automated segmentation as a pre-processing step for classification improves the generalization capability and the performance of the classification models.","output":"Improving Classification Model Performance on Chest X-Rays through Lung Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Scientific knowledge about epilepsies and their clinical ramifications is rapidly expanding. This becomes an even greater challenge for non-specialists to process. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can play an important role as an expert-driven diagnostic and therapeutic tool which gives automated and individualized advice. In addition, medical apps and telemedical procedures for diagnostics and treatment and assistance systems for seizure detection in epilepsy patients have become available. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview on current tele-epileptological developments and the available telemedical applications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on personal experience and a review of the literature, current epilepsy-specific CDSS, medical apps and assistance systems as well as telemedical applications are characterized and the clinical fields of application are presented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Due to the chronic course and the complexity of the epilepsies and their sequelae, persons with epilepsy could profit from CDSS. Epilepsy-specific CDSS should be usable by medical professionals and patients themselves. Currently, medical apps for people with epilepsy are mostly used to document the clinical course, seizure frequency, medication compliance and side effects. Available seizure detection systems mainly detect generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). A clinical benefit of such devices is not yet sufficiently confirmed but appears to be likely, because these seizures are specifically associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) and interventions are considered to be effective.","output":"Decision-support-Systeme, Assistenzsysteme und Telemedizin in der Epileptologie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study, biospecimens from more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals have thus far been collected in the GEN-COVID Biobank (GCB).

METHODS We performed a retrospective medical record review of all the patients who have undergone hysterectomy for benign indications at UPMC-affiliated hospitals between fiscal years (FY) 2012 and 2014. RESULTS A total number of 6373 hysterectomy patient cases were included in this study: 88.7% (5653) were European American (EA), 11.02% (702) were African American (AA), and the remaining 0.28% (18) were of other ethnicities. We found that non-EA, women aged 45-60, traditional Medicaid, and traditional Medicare enrollees were more likely to have a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Residence in higher median income zip code (> $61,000) was associated with 60% lower odds of undergoing TAH. Both FY 2013 and 2014 were associated with significantly lower odds of TAH. Logistic regression results from the model for non-EA patients for FY 2012 and FY 2014 demonstrated that FY and zip code income group were not significant predictors of surgery type in this subgroup. Pathway implementation did not reduce racial disparity in MIH utilization. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that there is a significant disparity in MIH utilization, where non-EA and Medicaid/Medicare recipients had higher odds of undergoing TAH.

Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 na?ve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how people with epilepsy (PWE) in Brazil is dealing with the pandemic, in relation to seizure frequency, access to antiseizure medicines (ASM), medical follow-up, and well-being. METHODS: An online questionnaire survey among PWE (group 1) and caregivers (group 2) was applied in the social networks of the Brazilian Association of Epilepsy, the official Brazilian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. The questionnaire was composed of 46 generic questions in four areas, namely, demographics and baseline clinical data as well as epilepsy and quality-of-life impact by COVID-19 pandemic based on the domains of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 464 participants including 380 (81.9%) PWE (78.7% female; age 34.3 yrs.; 9.76) and 84 (18.1%) caregivers (patients' age 14.1 yrs.; 10.30). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.8% of PWE and 36.4% of caregivers reported difficulties in accessing the epilepsy healthcare provider, and visits occurred normally only in 29.7% of PWE and in 34.5% of the caregivers group. Telehealth was not provided for 66.6% of group 1 and for 58.5% of group 2. Lack of availability of ASM was reported by 21.9% of PWE and 28.0% of caregivers in public dispensing units and by 19.2% and 17.8%, respectively, in private pharmacies. Increase in seizures during pandemic was mentioned by 26.3% and 27.9% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients who had increase in seizure frequency had more frequently reported problems with treatment and in quality-of-life concepts. Fear of having a more severe COVID-19 presentation because of epilepsy was reported by 74.5% of PWE and by 89.8% of caregivers. Dissatisfaction with current health status was reported by 36.7% and 38.1% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and that the support from others has decreased (56.1% and 66.1%, in groups 1 and 2) during the pandemic. The factors with higher Odds Ratio of increase in seizure frequency during pandemic were age >41 yrs., treatment in public healthcare system, drug-resistant epilepsy, adversities in getting ASM in public dispensing units, difficulties with prescription renewals, current financial problems and belief that epilepsy or ASM are risk factors for contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, PWE and caregivers reported increase in seizures in one-fourth of the patients and several difficulties, namely problems in accessing the healthcare system including ASM dispensation, telehealth, and fear of having a more severe COVID-19 because of epilepsy. There were also physical, psychological, and social concerns which affected quality-of-life-related aspects in this population.

We propose an approach to substitute evaluation using neural networks for most cases of forward analyses and to reduce the number of forward analyses. Forward analyses in the proposed method are used for producing the training data for a neural network; thereby they can be computed independently, and the actual elapsed time can be reduced by using a large-scale supercomputer.

To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4-28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7-13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants.

This also allowed crystal-based fragment screening to be performed with various compound libraries, ultimately to guide drug discovery for SV3CP. A total of 19 fragments were found to bind to the protease out of the 844 which were screened. Two of the hits were located at the active site of SV3CP and showed good inhibitory activity in kinetic assays. Another 5 were found at the enzymes putative RNA-binding site and a further 10 were located in the symmetric central cavity of the tetramer.","output":"In crystallo-screening for discovery of human norovirus 3C-like protease inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deferred taxesresulting from differences between financial and tax accountshave been a long-standing, contentious issue in financial accounting regulation, practice, and research. Debates on concepts and standards have been accompanied by doubts around whether and the extent to which deferred taxes provide relevant information for financial statement users and are employed by firms to manage their earnings. This paper systematically reviews the body of empirical evidence that has emerged over the last three decades on deferred taxes in the fields of value relevance and earnings management. A bibliographic analysis and a narrative synthesis are presented within a thematic categorization framework. Key results indicate that existing research focuses on the US setting. There is substantial evidence for the value relevance of various deferred tax items but limited evidence that firms use deferred taxes to manage their earnings. The findings suggest implications for both future research and the regulatory debate.","output":"Financial accounting for deferred taxes: a systematic review of empirical evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mismatch between when individuals breed and when we think they should breed has been a long-standing problem in evolutionary ecology. Price et al. is a classic theory paper in this field and is mainly cited for its most obvious result: if individuals with high nutritional condition breed early, then the advantage of breeding early may be overestimated when information on nutritional condition is absent. Price at al.'s less obvious result is that individuals, on average, are expected to breed later than the optimum. Here, we provide an explanation of their non-intuitive result in terms of hard selection, and go on to show that neither of their results are expected to hold if the relationship between breeding date and nutrition is allowed to evolve. By introducing the assumption that the advantage of breeding early is greater for individuals in high nutritional condition, we show that their most cited result can be salvaged. However, individuals, on average, are expected to breed earlier than the optimum, not later. More generally, we also show that the hard selection mechanisms that underpin these results have major implications for the evolution of plasticity: when environmental heterogeneity becomes too great, plasticity is selected against, prohibiting the evolution of generalists.","output":"Directional selection and the evolution of breeding date in birds, revisited: Hard selection and the evolution of plasticity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the enormous upgrade of clinical sensors, it has acquired developing interest to investigate the Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) because of its wide relevance for wellbeing of patient.

This review considers the empirical literature to date on using videoconferencing to deliver psychological therapy to adults presenting with mental health problems. METHOD: Papers were identified via search of relevant databases. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted and synthesized on uptake, feasibility, outcomes, and participant and therapist experiences. RESULTS: Videoconferencing has an established evidence base in the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapies for post\\\\traumatic stress disorder and depression, with prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation non\\\\inferior to in\\\\person delivery. There are large trials reporting efficacy for health anxiety and bulimia nervosa compared with treatment\\\\as\\\\usual. Initial studies show applicability of cognitive behavioural therapies for other anxiety and eating disorders and obsessiveCcompulsive spectrum disorders, but there has yet to be study of use in severe and complex mental health problems. Therapists may find it more difficult to judge non\\\\verbal behaviour, and there may be initial discomfort while adapting to videoconferencing, but client ratings of the therapeutic alliance are similar to in\\\\person therapy, and videoconferencing may have advantages such as being less confronting. There may be useful opportunities for videoconferencing in embedding therapy delivery within the clients own environment. CONCLUSIONS: Videoconferencing is an accessible and effective modality for therapy delivery. Future research needs to extend beyond testing whether videoconferencing can replicate in\\\\person therapy delivery to consider unique therapeutic affordances of the videoconferencing modality. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Videoconferencing is an efficacious means of delivering behavioural and cognitive therapies to adults with mental health problems. Trial evidence has established it is no less efficacious than in\\\\person therapy for prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation. While therapists report nonverbal feedback being harder to judge, and clients can take time to adapt to videoconferencing, clients rate the therapeutic alliance and satisfaction similarly to therapy in\\\\person.

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute tonsillitis or PTA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 PTA cases. 54.4% (n=410) of tonsillitis and 45.3% (187/413) of PTAs were discharged from ED. 9.6% (39/408) of tonsillitis and 10.3% (19/184) of PTA discharges re-presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% (33/341) and 10.6% (24/224) for those admitted from ED. The subsequent admission rate of those initially discharged from ED was 4.7% for tonsillitis and 3.3% for PTAs. IV steroids and antibiotics increased the percentage of patients able to swallow from 35.8% to 72.5% for tonsillitis (n=270/754 and 441/608) and from 22.3% to 71.0% for PTA (n=92/413 and 265/373). 77.2% of PTAs underwent drainage (n=319/413), with no significant difference in re-presentations in those drained vs not-drained (10.6% vs 9.5%, n=15/142 vs 4/42, p=0.846).

CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans.

The aim was to assess the importance of the choice of the most adequate calculation modality, providing recommendations about the choice of the computation tool. METHODS: The performances were evaluated both on phantoms and patients in a multi-level approach. Different phantoms filled with a 177Lu-radioactive solution were used: a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, a phantom with organ-shaped inserts and two cylindrical phantoms with inserts different for shape and volume. A total of 70 patients with NETs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The comparisons were performed mainly between the mean values of the absorbed dose in the regions of interest. A general better agreement was obtained between Dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations results rather than between either of these two and organ-level dosimetry, both for phantoms and patients. Phantoms measurements also showed the discrepancies mainly depend on the geometry of the inserts (e.g. shape and volume). For patients, differences were more pronounced than phantoms and higher inter/intra patient variability was observed. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that voxel-level techniques for dosimetry calculation are potentially more accurate and personalized than organ-level methods. In particular, a voxel-convolution method provides good results in a short time of calculation, while Monte Carlo based computation should be conducted with very fast calculation systems for a possible use in clinics, despite its intrinsic higher accuracy. Attention to the calculation modality is recommended in case of clinical regions of interest with irregular shape and far from spherical geometry, in which Monte Carlo seems to be more accurate than voxel-convolution methods.","output":"Comparison of different calculation techniques for absorbed dose assessment in patient specific peptide receptor radionuclide therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses cause a wide range of human diseases that are associated with high mortality and morbidity.

Staff and patients are at increased risk during an examination or intervention, so certain restrictions ought to be introduced. Hence, we aimed to measure the effect of the pandemic on endoscopy units in real-life settings. METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, carried out between 7 April and 15 June 2020. Responds came from many countries, and the participation was voluntary. The survey contained 40 questions, which evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy units and assessed the infection control. RESULTS: A total of 312 questionnaires were filled, 120 from Hungary, and 192 internationally, and 54 questionnaires (17.3%) were sent from high-risk countries; 84.9% of the gastroenterologists declared that they read the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) statement, while only 32.1% participated in any advanced training at their workplace. Overall, 92.1% of gastroenterologists realized risk stratification, and 72.1% claimed to have enough protective equipment. In 52.6% of the endoscopy units, at least one endoscopist had to discontinue the work due to any risk factor, while 40.6% reported that the reduced staff did not affect the workflow. Gastroenterologists considered that the five most important examinations both in low and high-risk patients are the following: lower/upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with hemodynamic instability, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in obstructive jaundice, foreign body in the esophagus, ERCP in acute biliary pancreatitis, and iron deficiency anemia with hemodynamic instability, which correlates well with the ESGE recommendation. Significant correlation was found in the usage of the necessary protective equipment in high-risk patients depending on the countries (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The survey found weak correlation in preliminary training depending on countries; nevertheless, in Hungary during the examined period, endoscopists considered the recommendations more strictly than in other countries. Although many physicians left the endoscopy lab, the workflow was not affected, probably due to the reduced number of examinations.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the workflow of endoscopy units: an international survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Benzalacetophenones, precursors of flavonoids are aromatic ketones and enones and possess the immunostimulant as well as antiviral activities.

METHODS Symptomatic patients referred on suspected cancer pathway and those on polyp surveillance between 2015 and 2019 were approached to participate. Accuracy estimates of FIT at different cut-off levels in diagnosing colorectal neoplasm were evaluated. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of PPIs on FIT. RESULTS A total of 667 participants were eligible for final analysis. At cut-off of 10 g/g faeces, the overall sensitivity and specificity of FIT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.71 to 0.94) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.84), respectively.

As transplantation is the only option for patients with end-stage lung disease, advancements in technology are needed to decrease wait-list time and mortality. This review summarizes the results from the application of EVLP as a therapeutic intervention and focuses on the use of the platform with regard to cell therapies, cell product therapies, and cytokine filtration among other technologies. This review will summarize both the clinical and translational science being conducted in these aspects and will highlight the opportunities for EVLP to be developed as a powerful tool to increase the donor lung supply.","output":"Current Status and Future Perspectives on Machine Perfusion: A Treatment Platform to Restore and Regenerate Injured Lungs Using Cell and Cytokine Adsorption Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Burnout remains a persistent issue affecting nurses across the US health system. Limited evidence exists about the direct impact of nurse burnout on patient outcomes. This study explores the relationship between nurse burnout and mortality, failure to rescue, and length of stay, while also considering the effect of a good work environment. Methods: Cross sectional data from nurses and hospitals were used in conjunction with patient claims data. Multivariate logistic regression was used to study the relationship between nurse burnout, patient outcomes, the work environment, and Magnet status. Results: Higher odds of patient mortality, failure to rescue, and prolonged length of stay were found in hospitals that had, on average, higher nurse burnout scores. Good work environments were found to attenuate the relationship between nurse burnout and mortality, failure to rescue, and length of stay. Magnet status, another indicator of a good work environment, was found to attenuate the relationship between nurse burnout and mortality and failure to rescue. Conclusions: Improving the work environment remains a solution for hospitals looking to concurrently improve nurse burnout and patient outcomes. Administrators may look to the Magnet recognition program as a blueprint to better support nurses in providing safe, high quality care.","output":"Leveraging the Work Environment to Minimize the Negative Impact of Nurse Burnout on Patient Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Libya was diagnosed in March 2020. We aimed to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 in Libya. METHOD: In this retrospective descriptive study, we analyzed the demographics, initial clinical presentation, history, comorbidities, laboratory findings, complications, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at several centers in the Western part of Libya between March 24, 2020, and December 3, 2020. RESULTS: The study included 811 (67.2%) men and 396 (32.8%) women. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 56 (40-64). A total of 173 (14.3%) patients developed respiratory distress syndrome, while 70 (5.8%) developed circulatory shock and hypotension; 190 (15.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 27 (2.2%) patients, and 45 (3.7%) developed arrhythmia. Acute kidney injury occurred in 44 (3.6%) patients. Of the patients admitted during the study period, 149 (12.3%) died. The predominant comorbidities ordered in a descending manner were as follows; diabetes mellitus, presented 490 (40.6%), hypertension in 414 (34.3%), chronic kidney disease in 114 (9.4%), and lung diseases in 103 (8.5%). The total white blood cell, neutrophil; monocyte; D-dimer; creatinine kinase; creatine kinase-MB; creatinine; total bilirubin; alanine and aspartate aminotransferase; and hypersensitive troponin were increased among non-survivors, whereas lymphocyte and platelet counts were decreased among non-survivors.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United States. We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for Italy also over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. CFRs vary from 0.7% in Germany and 1.6% in South Korea to 8.6% in Spain and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain's difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6% between March 9 and March 29, 2020, and more than 95% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of infected cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case fatality rates indicate the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","output":"Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 disease has arisen to be a pandemic. Since there is a close association between other viral infection cases by epidemics and environmental factors, this study intends to unveil meteorological effects on the outbreak of COVID-19 across eight divisions of Bangladesh from March to April 2020. A compound Poisson generalized linear modeling (CPGLM), along with a Monte-Carlo method and random forest (RF) model, was employed to explore how meteorological factors affecting the COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Results showed that subtropical climate (mean temperature about 26.6 C, mean relative humidity (MRH) 64%, and rainfall approximately 3 mm) enhanced COVD-19 onset. The CPGLM model revealed that every 1 mm increase in rainfall elevated by 30.99% (95% CI 77.18%, - 15.20%) COVID-19 cases, while an increase of 1 C of diurnal temperature (TDN) declined the confirmed cases by - 14.2% (95% CI 9.73%, - 38.13%) on the lag 1 and lag 2, respectively. In addition, NRH and MRH had the highest increase (17.98% (95% CI 22.5%, 13.42%) and 19.92% (95% CI: 25.71%, 14.13%)) of COVID-19 cased in lag 4. The results of the RF model indicated that TDN and AH (absolute humidity) influence the COVID-19 cases most. In the Dhaka division, MRH is the most vital meteorological factor that affects COVID-19 deaths. This study indicates the humidity and rainfall are crucial factors affecting the COVID-19 case, which is contrary to many previous studies in other countries.

A total of 393 undergraduate students completed measures of Swine Flu fears, anxiety sensitivity, OC beliefs and symptoms, and disgust sensitivity. It was found that both OC beliefs and OC symptoms significantly predicted Swine Flu fears. While disgust sensitivity significantly mediated the relationship between both OC beliefs and OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears using the Sobel test, anxiety sensitivity was a significant mediator only for OC symptoms. Additionally, path modeling showed that anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears best.

Structural analysis of the top scoring hits and a docking study were used to select the best derivatives for the synthesis. Chemical synthesis and structural elucidation of compounds 16aCh were discussed. The antiproliferative activity of 16aCh was evaluated against three cancer (MCF7, A2780 and HT29, IC(50) = 0.01C40.50 M) and one normal MRC5 (IC(50) = 1.27C24.06 M) cell lines using the MTT assay. The results revealed the highest antiproliferative activity against MCF7 cells for 16g (IC(50) = 0.01 M) with an exceptionally high selectivity index of (SI = 578). Cell cycle analysis of MCF7 cells treated with compound 16g revealed a cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase. In addition, compound 16g induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic events in MCF7 cells compared to the control. In silico target prediction of compound 16g showed six potential targets that could mediate these activities. Molecular docking analysis of compound 16g revealed high binding affinities toward COX-2, MAP P38, EGFR, and CDK2. The results of the MD simulation revealed low RMSD values and high negative binding free energies for the two complexes formed between compound 16g with EGFR, and CDK2, while COX-2 was in the third order.

However, regulations require that these activities are routinely undertaken for all medicinal products, including older medicines such as generic medicinal products with a well-established safety profile. For the latter, the risk management plans no longer contain important risks, considered important safety concerns, on the basis that routine pharmacovigilance activity would not allow their further characterisation. Society assumes that unexpected adverse reactions causally related to pharmacological activity are very unlikely to be detected for such well-established medicines, but important risks can still occur. For these products, a change in the safety profile which is brand or source specific and usually local in nature, associated with failures with the adequate control of quality of manufacturing or distribution are important safety issues. These may be the consequence of manufacturing and pharmacovigilance quality systems that are not fully integrated over the product life cycle (e.g. inadequate control of quality defects affecting one or multiple batches; inadequate impact assessment of change/variation of manufacturing, quality control testing, storage and distribution processes; inadequate control over the distribution channels including the introduction of counterfeit or falsified products into the supply chain). Drug safety hazards caused by the above-mentioned issues have been identified with different products and formulations, from small molecules to complex molecules such as biological products extracted from animal sources, biosimilars and advanced therapy medicinal products. The various phases of the drug manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products require inputs from pharmacovigilance to assess any effects of quality-related issues and to identify proportionate risk minimisation measures that often have design implications for a medicine which requires a close link between proactive vigilance and good manufacturing practice. To illustrate our argument for closer organisational integration, some examples of drug safety hazards originating from quality, manufacturing and distribution issues are discussed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Monitoring the manufacturing and quality of medicines: the fundamental task of pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance is the science relating to the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of adverse reactions with pharmaceutical products. The collection and assessment of adverse reactions are particularly important in the first decade after marketing authorisation of a drug as the information gathered in this period could help, for example, to identify complications from its use which were unknown before its commercialization. However, when it comes to medicines that have been on the market for a long time there is general acceptance that their safety profile is already well-established and unknown adverse reactions unlikely to occur. Nevertheless, even older medicines, such as generic drugs, can generate new risks. For these drugs a change in the safety profile could be the result of inadequate control of their quality, manufacturing and distribution systems. To overcome such an obstacle, it is necessary to fully integrate manufacturing and pharmacovigilance quality systems in the medicine life-cycle. This could help detect safety hazards and prevent the development of new complications which may arise due to the poor quality of a drug. Pharmacovigilance activities should indeed be included in all phases of the drugs manufacturing and distribution process, regardless of their chemical complexity to detect quality-related matters in good time and reduce the risk of safety concerns to a minimum.","output":"Monitoring the manufacturing and quality of medicines: a fundamental task of pharmacovigilance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate vaccine-induced humoral and cell-mediated immunity at 6 months post BNT162b2 vaccination, immunoglobulin G against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP IgG), 50% neutralizing antibody (NT50), and spot-forming cell (SFC) counts were evaluated by interferon-{gamma} releasing ELISpot assay of 98 healthy subjects (median age, 43 years).

Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44-418 794) participants, aged 42-84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (&#8805;2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65-69 years) and male gender among 20-64 years (but not older).

For instance, they mediate cellCcell interaction, viral infection, and protein folding of glycoproteins. Glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is closely related to the onset of diseases such as misfolding diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In this review, we focused on oligomannose-type glycan processing in the ER, which has central roles in glycoprotein folding in the ER, and we summarise relationship between oligomannose-type glycan processing and misfolding diseases arising from the disruption of ER homeostasis. ABSTRACT: Glycoprotein folding plays a critical role in sorting glycoprotein secretion and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, relationships between glycoprotein folding and several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and various neurodegenerative disorders, are indicated. Patients cells with type 2 diabetes, and various neurodegenerative disorders induce ER stress, against which the cells utilize the unfolded protein response for protection. However, in some cases, chronic and/or massive ER stress causes critical damage to cells, leading to the onset of ER stress-related diseases, which are categorized into misfolding diseases. Accumulation of misfolded proteins may be a cause of ER stress, in this respect, perturbation of oligomannose-type glycan processing in the ER may occur. A great number of studies indicate the relationships between ER stress and misfolding diseases, while little evidence has been reported on the connection between oligomannose-type glycan processing and misfolding diseases. In this review, we summarize alteration of oligomannose-type glycan processing in several ER stress-related diseases, especially misfolding diseases and show the possibility of these alteration of oligomannose-type glycan processing as indicators of diseases.","output":"Oligomannose-Type Glycan Processing in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Its Importance in Misfolding Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: People with HIV (PWH) are living longer lives and likely experiencing accentuated aging. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has been proposed as a way to identify and help meet each individual patients needs. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the results of CGA in an HIV clinic in New York City. CGA included assessment of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, screens for depression, anxiety, frailty, cognition, and quality of life, along with general discussion of concerns and goals. We compared the group of PWH referred for CGA to those of comparable age who were not referred to determine the factors that were associated with referral.

Ninety patients were asked about their goals, and the most commonly cited were related to health or finances;fifteen patients were unable to articulate any goals. Having fewer goals and noting weight loss or fatigue were predictive of higher scores on the PHQ-2 depression screen. Conclusion: Although most older PWH undergoing CGA can manage their ADL, many have concerns and deficits beyond their comorbidities. CGA offers an important window into the psychosocial concerns and needs of older PWH.","output":"Aging-Related Concerns of People Living with HIV Referred for Geriatric Consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been a call to use innovative digital tools for the purpose of protecting public health.

Vaccine development efforts focus on the viral trimeric spike glycoprotein as the main target of the humoral immune response. Viral spikes carry glycans that facilitate immune evasion by shielding specific protein epitopes from antibody neutralization, and antigen efficacy is influenced by spike glycoprotein production in vivo. Therefore, immunogen integrity is important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates. Here, we show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes, wild-type, non-stabilized spikes expressed from a plasmid with a CMV promoter and tPA signal sequence, and commonly used recombinant, engineered spike glycoproteins. Furthermore, we show that their distinctive cellular secretion pathways result in different protein glycosylation and secretion patterns, including shedding of spike monomeric subunits for the non-stabilized wild-type spike tested, which may have implications for the resulting immune response and vaccine design.","output":"Assessing Antigen Structural Integrity through Glycosylation Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Viral Spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Factors contributing to racial inequities in outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain poorly understood.

These deficits, collectively termed the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), impact health-related quality-of-life. Survivors of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure may be at particularly high risk of PICS due to delirium and prolonged mechanical ventilation, and factors unique to the pandemic, including physical isolation from medical staff, lack of in-hospital family presence, limited post-acute care rehabilitation, and widespread economic recession. Given this context, we describe the prevalence of PICS 6 months following hospital discharge among survivors of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study from March to December 2020 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. We identified ICU survivors who underwent at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19. We contacted eligible patients via telephone at 6 months post-hospital discharge. Sample size was determined by thematic saturation of interviews within a concurrent qualitative assessment. We used the Society of Critical Care Medicine international consensus recommendations for PICS assessment. We assessed anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact-of-Events Scale, respectively. We assessed physical impairment with the EQ-5D questionnaire, and cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Blind. Data are means + standard deviation or number (percent). RESULTS: We completed telephone interviews with 50 of 173 eligible patients (53 contacted, 3 declined). Age was 57+13 years, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 14+8.2 days and PaO2:FiO2 ratio at intubation was 17446. Delirium developed in 35 patients (70%). Six months post-discharge, 38 patients (76%) met criteria for PICS, with 1 or more domains impaired. Among patients with PICS, 22 (44%) were impaired in at least 2 domains, and 9 (18%) impaired in all 3 domains. PTSD was present in 17 patients (34%), anxiety in 19 (38%), and depression in 20 (40%). Twenty-four patients (48%) had impairments in activities of daily living. Nineteen patients (37%) demonstrated cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS Over three quarters of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure survivors demonstrated PICS 6 months after hospital discharge. Patients were commonly impaired in at least two domains. These estimates of PICS prevalence appear broadly similar to those reported in the pre-COVID-19 literature and should drive focused efforts to identify COVID-19 survivors at high risk for PICS prior to discharge.","output":"Long-term impairment in cognition, mental health, and physical function following covid-19-associated respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new public health crisis, threatening almost all aspects of human life. Originating in bats, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts, where it is primarily known to cause pneumonia-like complications in the respiratory system. Organ-to-organ transmission has not been ruled out, thereby raising the possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple organ systems. The male reproductive system has been hypothesized to be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by some preliminary evidence. This may pose a global threat to male fertility potential, as men are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, especially those of reproductive age. Preliminary reports have also indicated the possibility of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may cause severe complications in infected couples.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the overall outcome for dogs with NSAID overdose treated with TPE and to determine if any presenting factors can predict or influence overall outcome. Secondary objectives included investigating TPE complications as well as the utility of other adjunctive treatments. ANIMALS Eleven client-owned dogs presented for NSAID overdose that received TPE. All patients also received additional supportive treatment including IV lipid infusion. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS Eleven cases were included in the study. Of these, the NSAID ingested was ibuprofen in 6 (54.5%), naproxen in 4 (36.4%), and deracoxib in 1 (9.1%). All dogs survived to discharge with 3 (27.3%) developing acute kidney injury during hospitalization. A larger initial dose of NSAID ingested was associated with a higher maximum serum creatinine concentration during hospitalization (P = .04) and larger change in serum creatinine concentration from baseline (P = .02). Six dogs (54.5%) developed complications associated with TPE. The use of other treatments did not affect the overall outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE We identified TPE as an effective treatment for NSAID overdose with good outcomes despite high doses of NSAID ingestion in dogs treated with a single TPE treatment.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were 49 474 men and women (4612 years) residing in the Northern Netherlands from the Lifelines cohort study. SES indicators and lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, diet quality, sleep time and TV watching time) were assessed by questionnaire from the Lifelines Biobank. Self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status was obtained from the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 4711 participants who self-reported having had a COVID-19 infection, 2883 participants tested for COVID-19, and 123 positive cases were diagnosed in this study population. After adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, body mass index and ethnicity, we found that participants with low education or low income were less likely to self-report a COVID-19 infection (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.78 [0.71 to 0.86]; low income 0.86 [0.79 to 0.93]) and be tested for COVID-19 (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.58 [0.52 to 0.66]; low income 0.86 [0.78 to 0.95]) compared with high education or high income groups, respectively.

We sought to estimate the impact of COVID-19 booster doses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated and actively surveilled population of young adults during an Omicron-predominant period. Methods and Findings: We implemented a cohort study of young adults in a college environment (Cornell University's Ithaca campus) from December 5, 2021 through December 31, 2021 when Omicron was deemed the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant on campus. Participants included 15,102 university students fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized or approved vaccination (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S) who were enrolled in mandatory at-least-weekly surveillance PCR testing, and having no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 90 days before the start of the study period. Multivariable logistic regression considering those with full vaccination (a 2-dose series of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S) with a booster dose versus those without a booster dose. 1,870 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in the study population. Controlling for gender, student group membership, full vaccination date and initial vaccine type, our analysis estimates that receiving a booster dose reduces the odds of having a PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to full vaccination by 52% (95% confidence interval [37%, 64%]). This result is robust to the choice of the delay over which a booster dose becomes effective (varied from 1 day to 14 days). Conclusions: Boosters are effective, relative to full vaccination, in reducing the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a college student population during a period when Omicron was predominant. Therefore, booster vaccinations for this age group can play an important role in reducing community and institutional transmission.","output":"Boosters protect against SARS-CoV-2 infections in young adults during an Omicron-predominant period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly affected the dental care sector.

Attempts to contain its spread have entailed varying early screening and triage strategies implemented in different countries and regions. AIM: To share the experience of scientific and standardized management of fever clinics in China, which provide the first effective checkpoint for the prevention and control of COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: A fever clinic was established at our hospital in Tianjin, China, for initially identifying suspected cases of COVID-19 and controlling the spread of the disease. METHODS: The management system covered the following aspects: spatial layout; partitioning of functional zones; a work management system and associated processes; management of personnel, materials and equipment; and patient education. RESULTS: Within two months of introducing these measures, there was a comprehensive reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and zero infections occurred among medical staff at the fever clinic. DISCUSSION: The fever clinic plays an important role in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients presenting with fevers of unknown origin. Broad screening criteria, an adequate warning mechanism, manpower reserves and staff training at the clinic are essential for the early management of epidemics. CONCLUSION: The spread of COVID-19 has been effectively curbed through the establishment of the fever clinic, which merits widespread promotion and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICIES: Health managers should be made aware of the important role of fever clinics in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients, and in the treatment of infectious diseases to prevent and control their spread.

We evaluated the relations between PRA and all-cause mortality after three years and long-term, and to cardiovascular events after median 8.7 years. Adjustments were made for variables that influenced the hazard ratio (HR) > 5% for the relation between PRA and outcome. RESULTS Baseline PRA was associated with all-cause mortality during three-years (unadjusted HR 1.74 per 1 SD increase in logarithmically transformed PRA; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.16, p < 0.0001) and long-term (HR 1.12, CI 1.00-1.25, p = 0.046).

Since this is the first-ever demonstration of cold plasma inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, it is a significant milestone in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and presents a new opportunity for the scientific, engineering, and medical communities.","output":"Cold atmospheric plasma for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates are a class of large and diverse biomolecules, ranging from a simple monosaccharide to large multi-branching glycan structures. The covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine, a process referred to as N-linked glycosylation, plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. Most software for glycan modeling on a personal desktop computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. There are a number of popular web-based tools that are available for modeling glycans (e.g., GLYCAM-WEB (http://https://dev.glycam.org/gp/) or Glycosciences.db (http://www.glycosciences.de/)). However, these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations and do not allow the user to incorporate glycan modeling into their protein structure modeling workflow. RESULTS: Here, we present Glycosylator, a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure that can be used directly in a Python script through its application programming interface (API) or through its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward two-dimensional (2D) rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the glycosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific three-dimensional (3D) glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. CONCLUSIONS: Glycosylator was used to generate models of glycosylated protein without steric clashes. Since the molecular topology is based on the CHARMM force field, new complex sugar moieties can be generated without modifying the internals of the code. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. Glycosylator will be a valuable tool for the glycoinformatics and biomolecular modeling communities.","output":"Glycosylator: a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Use of herbal medicine (HM) for the treatment and prevention of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) has been reported worldwide. In this study, we aimed to assess the perceptions, attitude and practices of healthcare professionals (HP) students in Uganda concerning HM use in the management of COVID-19 illness. Methods: : We conducted an online, cross-sectional study using quantitative methods among HP students across the 12 medical schools in Uganda. Undergraduate HP students aged 18 years and older, from 1 st to 5 th year of study, pursuing various programs were recruited. Blooms cut-off of 80% (score of  24 /30) was used to determine good perception and a positive attitude towards HM use. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with HM use. Results: : A total of 350 participants responded. Of this, 223 (63.7%) were male. The median age of all participants was 23 (IQR=19-56) years. Majority (n=234, 66.9%) were pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB). All participants reported awareness on HM use in the management of COVI-19. Fifty-four (15.4%) respondents had a good perception towards HM use, with students in their first year of study having 3-fold the odds of having good perception compared to those in their fifth year (aOR: 2.9, 95% C.

One potential source of bias is an index date selection procedure for the unvaccinated cohort or unvaccinated comparison time (\\"anchoring\\"). OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluate different index date selection procedures for two vaccinations: against COVID-19 and influenza. METHODS: For each vaccine, we extracted patient baseline characteristics on the index date and up to 450 days prior and then compared them to the characteristics of the unvaccinated patients indexed on (a) an arbitrary date or (b) a date of a visit. Additionally, we compared vaccinated patients indexed on the date of vaccination and the same patients indexed on a prior date or visit. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination differ drastically from each other in terms of populations vaccinated and their status on the day of vaccination. When compared to indexing on a visit in unvaccinated population, influenza vaccination had markedly higher covariate proportions and COVID-19 vaccination had lower proportions of most covariates on the index date. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccination had similar covariate proportions when compared to an arbitrary date. These effects attenuated but were still present with a longer lookback period. The effect of day 0 was present even when patients served as their own controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patient baseline characteristics are sensitive to the choice of the index date. In vaccine safety studies, unexposed index event should represent vaccination settings. Study designs previously used to assess influenza vaccination must be reassessed for COVID-19 to account for a potentially healthier population and lack of medical activity on the day of vaccination.","output":"Differential anchoring effects of vaccination comparator selection: characterizing a potential bias due to healthcare utilization in COVID-19 versus influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The 2020 coronavirus lockdown lead to medical educators finding new ways to teach.

Many studies have added to our understanding of the biology of the malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi from functional in vitro and imaging analysis using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, sample fixation and metal coating during SEM analysis can alter the parasite membrane. METHODS: In this study, we used noninvasive diffraction optical tomography (DOT), also known as holotomography, to explore the morphological, biochemical, and mechanical alterations of each stage of P. knowlesi-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Each stage of the parasite was synchronized using Nycodenz and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) for P. knowlesi and P. falciparum, respectively. Holotomography was applied to measure individual three-dimensional refractive index tomograms without metal coating, fixation, or additional dye agent. RESULTS: Distinct profiles were found on the surface area and hemoglobin content of the two parasites. The surface area of P. knowlesi-infected RBCs showed significant expansion, while P. falciparum-infected RBCs did not show any changes compared to uninfected RBCs. In terms of hemoglobin consumption, P. falciparum tended to consume hemoglobin more than P. knowlesi. The observed profile of P. knowlesi-infected RBCs generally showed similar results to other studies, proving that this technique is unbiased. CONCLUSIONS: The observed profile of the surface area and hemoglobin content of malaria infected-RBCs can potentially be used as a diagnostic parameter to distinguish P. knowlesi and P. falciparum infection. In addition, we showed that holotomography could be used to study each Plasmodium species in greater depth, supporting strategies for the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies for malaria.

One cause for concern with such reviews is the possibility that results from unpublished trials are not represented in the review findings or data synthesis. This problem, known as publication bias, results when studies reporting statistically nonsignificant findings are left unpublished and, therefore, not included in meta-analyses when estimating a pooled treatment effect. In turn, publication bias may lead to skewed results with overestimated effect sizes. The primary objective of this study is to determine the extent to which evaluations for publication bias are conducted by systematic reviewers in highly ranked anesthesiology journals and which practices reviewers use to mitigate publication bias. The secondary objective of this study is to conduct publication bias analyses on the meta-analyses that did not perform these assessments and examine the adjusted pooled effect estimates after accounting for publication bias. METHODS This study considered meta-analyses and systematic reviews from 5 peer-reviewed anesthesia journals from 2007 through 2015. A PubMed search was conducted, and full-text systematic reviews that fit inclusion criteria were downloaded and coded independently by 2 authors. Coding was then validated, and disagreements were settled by consensus. In total, 207 systematic reviews were included for analysis. In addition, publication bias evaluation was performed for 25 systematic reviews that did not do so originally. We used Egger regression, Duval and Tweedie trim and fill, and funnel plots for these analyses. RESULTS Fifty-five percent (n = 114) of the reviews discussed publication bias, and 43% (n = 89) of the reviews evaluated publication bias. Funnel plots and Egger regression were the most common methods for evaluating publication bias. Publication bias was reported in 34 reviews (16%). Thirty-six of the 45 (80.0%) publication bias analyses indicated the presence of publication bias by trim and fill analysis, whereas Egger regression indicated publication bias in 23 of 45 (51.1%) analyses. The mean absolute percent difference between adjusted and observed point estimates was 15.5%, the median was 6.2%, and the range was 0% to 85.5%. CONCLUSIONS Many of these reviews reported following published guidelines such as PRISMA or MOOSE, yet only half appropriately addressed publication bias in their reviews. Compared with previous research, our study found fewer reviews assessing publication bias and greater likelihood of publication bias among reviews not performing these evaluations.","output":"Publication Bias and Nonreporting Found in Majority of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses in Anesthesiology Journals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis and is acquired by drinking water containing copepods (water fleas) infected with D. medinensis larvae.

There is no vaccine or medicine to treat the disease; eradication efforts rely on case containment* to prevent water contamination.

The present study was to evaluate GSe for its effect on the immune response to aPrV vaccine in neonatal mice with MatAb. Results showed that GSe had adjuvant effect on the immune response to aPrV vaccine in neonates. When GSe was co-administered with aPrV vaccine (aP-GSe), specific gB antibody, Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12 and IFN-) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) responses were significantly increased in association with enhanced protection of vaccinated neonates against the lethal PrV challenge even though MatAb existed when compared to the neonates immunized with aPrV vaccine alone. GSe-enhanced immune response depended on its use in the primary immunization. The mechanisms underlying the adjuvant effect of GSe may be due to more innate immune related pathways activated by GSe. Transcriptome analysis of splenocytes from neonates immunized with aP-GSe, aPrV or saline solution showed that there were 3976 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in aP-GSe group while 5959 DEGs in aPrV group when compared to the control.

Usual legal and ethical frameworks should continue to apply while capacity and mutual aid are available (CRITCON-PANDEMIC levels 0-3); clinicians should focus on current clinical needs and should not treat patients differently because of anticipated future pressures.

With over eight million individuals infected and exceeding 400,000 deaths globally, the necessity to develop fast and efficient diagnostic methods is of high importance. This paper reports on currently available diagnostic screening methods for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to guide frontline healthcare workers involved with the diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient. An electronic literature search was performed for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020, until June 19, 2020. Published articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic. The preferred diagnostic approach is the reverse transcription (RT) of the virus' ribonucleic acid (RNA) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (RT-PCR). However, this method has been proven to be time-consuming. In improving the speed and efficiency of diagnostics, newer rapid diagnostic serological tests are in development for testing SARS-CoV-2, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problem, which was largely caused by irrational off-label use of antivirals, anthelmintics, antimalarials, and, most notably, macrolide antibiotics. The One Health Approach is progressively becoming the most widely utilized in the fight against AMR. Our aim is to address the lack of teachings in AMR and the One Health Approach in health student curricula, as well as to provide recommendations that can be implemented as we progress beyond the COVID-19 era. Methods & Materials We conducted a literature review to identify the status of AMR and One Health education in health curriculum over the world while analysing the relevance and urgency of the topic within the COVID-19 era. Results We identified multiple gaps and discrepancies in AMR and One Health education that could be attributed to multiple reasons including the absence of a formal curriculum on the topics, and lack of interprofessional educational practices. The development and implementation of AMR and One Health topics in the school curriculum is important in equipping future health professionals to fully combat AMR in their respective fields. It can also therefore be encouraged that institutions synergize to share knowledge on useful ways of training healthcare students in addition to meaningful ways to communicate AMR concerns with patients and the public. Various teaching modalities could influence the outcome of antimicrobial prescribing practices. These could be improved by a re-evaluation of problem-based learning strategies, enhancing content and conduction of virtual learning platforms and development of a standardized curriculum on antimicrobial resistance. Interprofessional education and team-based learning can also be a facilitator to familiarize students with the One Health concept. Conclusion Today's health professionals need to provide mentorship and teaching for students on AMR and One Health. This will aid to develop today's young professionals and future health professionals with the necessary skills to prevent and tackle the spread of AMR with appreciation and knowledge of the One Health Approach.","output":"Antimicrobial Resistance and One Health in the Post COVID-19 Era: What should Health Students Learn?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors propose a dynamic hierarchical linear model (DHLM) to study the variations in the costs of trade finance over time and across countries in dynamic environments such as the global financial crisis of 2008C2009 The DHLM can cope with challenges that a dynamic environment entails: nonstationarity, parameters changing over time and cross-sectional heterogeneity The authors employ a DHLM to examine how the effects of four macroeconomic indicators C GDP growth, inflation, trade intensity and stock market capitalization - on trade finance costs varied over a period of five years from 2006 to 2010 across 8 countries We find that the effect of these macroeconomic indicators varies over time, and most of this variation is present in the year preceding and succeeding the financial crisis In addition, the trajectory of time-varying effects of GDP growth and inflation support the flight to quality hypothesis: cost of trade finance reduces in countries with high GDP growth and low inflation, during the crisis The authors also note presence of country-specific heterogeneity in some of these effects The authors propose extensions to the model and discuss its alternative uses in different contexts","output":"Modeling the Costs of Trade Finance During the Financial Crisis of 2008C2009: An Application of Dynamic Hierarchical Linear Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naturally occurring milk compounds have recently been investigated for their health-promoting properties; in fact, their anti-microbial, immuno-modulatory, antioxidant and anti-thrombotic activities, have increasingly gained interest within the scientific community.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the reproductive numbers (R) for each epidemic stage to analyze the effects of the preventive measures and to predict the COVID-19 transmission trends. METHODS: We estimated the transmission rates for each epidemic stage by fitting a COVID-19 transmission model, based on a deterministic mathematical model, to the data on confirmed cases. The effects of preventive measures such as social distancing by time period were analyzed, and the size and trends of future COVID-19 outbreaks were estimated. RESULTS: The value of R was 3.53 from February18, 2020 to February 28, 2020, and the mean R reduced to 0.45 from March 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020, but it significantly increased to 2.69 from April 30, 2020 to May13, 2020 and it was maintained at 1.03 from May 14, 2020 to July 23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: According to the estimated R, it had fallen to below 1 and was maintained at that level owing to the isolation of infected persons by the public health authorities and social distancing measures followed by the general public. Then, the estimated R increased rapidly as the contact among individuals increased during the long holiday period from April 30, 2020 to May 5, 2020.

We use a simple branching process model for COVID-19 transmission that includes a time-dependent probability of a false-negative test result. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with two tests is highly effective in preventing an infectious case entering the community, provided there is no transmission within quarantine facilities. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increases the risk of an infectious case being released. We calculate the fraction of cases detected in the second week of their two-week stay and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of transmission occurring within quarantine facilities.

Patients and Methods. A total of 165 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were examined for medical features and inflammatory markers such as blood IL-6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, neutrophil/lymphocyte index (NLI), D-Dimer, and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). Regression analyses concerning electronically collected medical data were adjusted by appropriate factors and confounding variables. Results. Plasma IL-6 determinations evidenced a consistent association with hospital stay days, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and mortality rates. Similar trends were found for other proinflammatory variables, where ferritin and NLI showed a remarkable value as surrogates. Hyperglycaemia and the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score were positively associated with the inflammatory response induced by the SARS-COV-2 infection. An unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking and alcoholic drinks consumption as well as excessive body adiposity influenced inflammatory-related outcomes in the screened patients.

RV failure is exacerbated by hypercapnic acidosis and overdistension induced by mechanical ventilation. Veno-venous extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) might allow ultraprotective ventilation with lower tidal volume (V(T)) and plateau pressure (P(plat)). This study investigated whether ECCO(2)R therapy could affect RV function. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental prospective observational pilot study performed in a French medical ICU. Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio between 80 and 150 mmHg were enrolled. An ultraprotective ventilation strategy was used with V(T) at 4 mL/kg of predicted body weight during the 24 h following the start of a low-flow ECCO(2)R device. RV function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during the study protocol. RESULTS: The efficacy of ECCO(2)R facilitated an ultraprotective strategy in all 18 patients included. We observed a significant improvement in RV systolic function parameters. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) increased significantly under ultraprotective ventilation compared to baseline (from 22.8 to 25.4 mm; p < 0.05). Systolic excursion velocity (S wave) also increased after the 1-day protocol (from 13.8 m/s to 15.1 m/s; p < 0.05). A significant improvement in the aortic velocity time integral (VTIAo) under ultraprotective ventilation settings was observed (p = 0.05). There were no significant differences in the values of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) and RV preload. CONCLUSION: Low-flow ECCO(2)R facilitates an ultraprotective ventilation strategy thatwould improve RV function in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients. Improvement in RV contractility appears to be mainly due to a decrease in intrathoracic pressure allowed by ultraprotective ventilation, rather than a reduction of PaCO(2).","output":"Ultraprotective ventilation allowed by extracorporeal CO(2) removal improves the right ventricular function in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients: a quasi-experimental pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 crisis forces individuals to self-isolate, work from home, and find new leisure activities, an increasing number are turning to online gaming.

During progressive disease stages, a microenvironment is created within the central nervous system (CNS) favoring the arrival and retention of inflammatory cells. Active demyelination and neurodegeneration have also been linked to microglia (MG) and astrocyte (AST)-activation in early lesions. While reactive MG can damage tissue, exacerbate deleterious effects, and contribute to neurodegeneration, it should be noted that activated MG possess neuroprotective functions as well, including debris phagocytosis and growth factor secretion. The progressive form of MS can be modelled by the prolonged administration to cuprizone (CPZ) in adult mice, as CPZ induces highly reproducible demyelination of different brain regions through oligodendrocyte (OLG) apoptosis, accompanied by MG and AST activation and axonal damage. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the effects of a reduction in microglial activation through orally administered brain-penetrant colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor BLZ945 (BLZ) on neurodegeneration and its correlation with demyelination, astroglial activation and behavior in a chronic CPZ-induced demyelination model. Our results show that BLZ treatment successfully reduced the microglial population and myelin loss. However, no correlation was found between myelin preservation and neurodegeneration, as axonal degeneration was more prominent upon BLZ treatment. Concomitantly, BLZ failed to significantly offset CPZ-induced astroglial activation and behavioral alterations. These results should be taken into account when proposing the modulation of microglial activation in the design of therapies relevant for demyelinating diseases.","output":"Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibition attenuates microgliosis and myelin loss but exacerbates neurodegeneration in the chronic cuprizone model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Las infecciones respiratorias agrupan tres entidades con indicaciones teraputicas diferentes: la bronquitis aguda, la neumona aguda y las exacerbaciones de la bronquitis crnica.

The purpose of this study was to understand how people with CF (PwCF) and families of PwCF experienced the shift to telehealthcare delivery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted in 11 CF Centers. Two surveys were designed (one for adult PwCF and one for parents/guardians of PwCF) by participating CF center members with patient and family partner input. Surveys were disseminated electronically via email/text to all patients who completed a telehealth visit, and data were collected on secure Google Forms. RESULTS: Respondents rated their telehealth experiences as positive. Most were highly satisfied with their telehealth visit (77% adult, 72% pediatric) and found the visits to be highly convenient (85% for all surveyed). A majority of patients reported they had adequate time during the visit and had all questions and concerns addressed. Importantly, we also identified concerns regarding lack of in-person assessments including pulmonary function testing (PFT) and throat/sputum culture.

Our external evaluation of this programme aimed to evaluate programme effects on implementation of maternal and newborn care practices, and impact on stillbirths, 7- and 28-day neonatal mortality rate in labour wards and neonatal care units. We also aimed to evaluate programme implementation and mechanisms of change. METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental plausibility design with a nested process evaluation. We evaluated effects on stillbirths, mortality and secondary outcomes relating to adherence to 20 evidence-based intrapartum and newborn care practices, comparing survey data from 29 hospitals receiving the intervention to 31 hospitals expected to receive the intervention later, using a difference-in-difference analysis. We analysed programme implementation data and conducted 42 semi-structured interviews in four case studies to describe implementation and address four theory-driven questions to explain the quantitative results. RESULTS: Only 7 of the 29 intervention hospitals were engaged in the intervention for its entire duration. There was no evidence of an effect of the intervention on stillbirths [DiD ? 1.3 percentage points, 95% CI ? 2.6C0.1], on neonatal mortality at age 7 days [DiD ? 1.6, 95% CI ? 9C6.2] or 28 days [DiD ? 3.0, 95% CI ? 12.96.9] or on adherence to target evidence-based intrapartum and newborn care practices. The process evaluation identified challenges in engaging leaders; challenges in developing capacity for quality improvement; and challenges in activating mechanisms of change at the unit level, rather than for a few individuals, and in sustaining these through the creation of new social norms.

Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated. Here, we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the SC2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and viral spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging, and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin, and inhibitors of phosphorylation abrogate these ACE2- and SPP-inductive events.

Egyptian poultry industry suffered from severe economic losses since the isolation of Velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) genotype VIId in 2011 and up till now despite the use of different vaccination programs. So, this study aimed to isolate and characterize the vNDV from a total of 120 poultry flocks from ten provinces in the Egyptian Delta region with a history of respiratory manifestation, high mortalities or a decrease in egg production between 2015 and 2019. Seventy-three samples allantoic fluid (73/120, 60.8%) were positive for hemagglutination with chicken RBCs. These samples were submitted to molecular examination using qRT-PCR specific primers for AOAV-1, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI-H5), low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI-H9) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). RESULTS: Fifty samples (50/120: 41.6%) were confirmed positive for AOAV-1, based on genetic analysis of matrix and fusion protein. The co-infection rate of other respiratory viral diseases examined was 1.6, 14.1, and 4.1%, for HPAI-H5, LPAI-H9, and IBV, respectively. Biologically, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of ten selected AOAV-1 isolates ranged from 1.70 to 1.98, which indicated the velogenic nature of these isolates. All the sixteen sequenced isolates were AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1. The full F gene sequence of six examined AOAV-1 VII.1.1 isolates contained the seven neutralizing epitopes, and the glycosylation motif of six-potential sites for N linked glycosylation at residues 85, 191, 366, 447, 471, and 541. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that the high prevalence of AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1 in the Egyptian chicken flocks despite the intensive vaccination with live and killed ND vaccines, as all the 16 isolates tested were belonged to this genotype. Homologous vaccination is badly needed to control and reduce the spread of AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1infection in Egyptian poultry flocks.","output":"Sequence analysis and pathogenicity of Avian Orthoavulavirus 1 strains isolated from poultry flocks during 2015C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our health care landscape is rapidly changing.

After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following the first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology: We developed a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of the Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results: The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the city closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all the cities. The more a city showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this article is to describe the surge experience with space, supplies, and staff training in response to COVID-19 and provide guidance to other organizations. BACKGROUND: A hospital's response to a large-scale event is greatly impacted by the ability to surge and, depending on the type of threat, to maintain a sustained response. To identify surge capacity, an organization must first consider the type of event to appropriately plan resources. PREPARATION PROCESS: An epidemic surge drill, conducted in 2012, served as a guide in planning for the COVID-19 pandemic. The principles of crisis standards of care and a hospital incident command structure were used to clearly define roles, open lines of communication, and inform our surge plan. Preparation began by collaborating with multidisciplinary groups to acquire the most appropriate space, as well as adequate supplies, and identify and train staff. IMPLEMENTATION: Teams were formed to identify the necessary resources to expand the intensive care unit (ICU) environment quickly and efficiently. Educational training was developed for redeployed staff. OUTCOMES: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center experienced the largest surge of ICU patients within a hospital system in the state of Massachusetts. The ICU capacity was expanded by 93% from 77 to 149 beds, and the surge was maintained for approximately 9 weeks. Shadowing experiences before the actual surge were extremely valuable.

Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. Methods Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. Results In simulations we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany. Conclusions Our method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases has rich contact investigation and/or genetic data. KEY MESSAGES This method provides a way to calculate the relative probability that two infectious disease patients are connected by direct transmission using clinical, demographic, geographic, and genetic characteristics.

However, recent studies have shown that publishing the results of (2) tests of SNPs or personal data could lead to privacy violations. Several studies have proposed anonymization methods for (2) testing with -differential privacy, which is the cryptographic communitys de facto privacy metric. However, existing methods can only be applied to 22 or 23 contingency tables, otherwise their accuracy is low for small numbers of samples.

Adult wild-type (WT), nAChR7 knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChR7 CreCC10) mice were exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased inflammatory cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased SARS-Cov-2 Covid-19 ACE2 receptor, whereas nAChR7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP2, MMP8 and MMP9, were altered both at the protein and mRNA transcript levels in female and male KO mice, but WT mice exposed to PG alone showed a sex-dependent phenotype.

Data on participants' demographic, socio-economic status, comorbidities, access to health care, treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviors, employment, and income were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with difficulty in accessing medicines and worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Further, a diverse sample of 40 participants completed qualitative interviews that focused on eliciting patient's experiences during the COVID-19 lockdowns and data analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred thirty-four individuals completed the survey (response rate = 74%). The mean (SD) age of respondents was 57.8 years (11.3) and 50% were men. During the COVID-19 lockdowns in India, 83% of participants reported difficulty in accessing healthcare, 17% faced difficulties in accessing medicines, 59% reported loss of income, 38% lost jobs, and 28% reduced fruit and vegetable consumption.

As more than one vaccination dose against COVID-19 is required to achieve sufficient protection, at least 69 VITT patients have undergone subsequent vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, with no relevant subsequent increase in anti-PF4 antibody titers, thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic complications. Also, re-exposure to adenoviral vector-based vaccines in five VITT patients was not associated with adverse reactions. Although data are limited, vaccination against influenza also appears to be safe. SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in one patient with preceding VITT did not influence anti-PF4 antibody levels. We discuss how these temporal characteristics of VITT provide insights into pathogenesis.","output":"Longitudinal Aspects of Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objectives People living with disabilities have been found to experience reduced participation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The personas were developed by mapping participants to behavioural variables identified from coded transcripts. After identifying behaviour patterns, characteristics and goals were synthesized. Setting Virtual-data collection via Zoom; community. Participants Community-dwelling individuals who have had a stroke (n = 26) were recruited. We included participants 19 years of age or older and if they were able to communicate in English. Participants were excluded if they had moderate or severe cognitive impairment or aphasia. Interventions N/A. Main Outcome Measures N/A. Results Our analysis identified 6 distinct personas that reflect participant behaviours and goals in regard to participation during COVID-19. 1) The Community Provider likes to feel involved and wants to engage in daily life. 2) The Homebody enjoys alone time but lacks a daily routine. This persona aims to feel motivated to accomplish personal goals. 3) The Independent seeks to be an active and integrated part of the community without physical or situational restrictions. 4) The Lifestyle Person wants to live the good life and do whatever they want, whenever they want. 5) The Contributor wants to feel needed and wants to be responsible for helping in the community. 6) The Health-Literate Participator wants to be on top of things and stay healthy for their family and themselves. Conclusions The personas highlight behaviours and goals in stroke patients towards physical activity and social participation during COVID-19. The personas will help guide the development of interventions to improve physical activity and social participation.

Objectives: To assess immediate and long-term effects of the pandemic on dermatology practice on a large scale, including the clinical activity of participant, frequency and types of procedures used, and teledermatology (TD) use. Methods: This web-based, global survey included 733 dermatologists. Primary outcomes are percentages of responders providing in-person consultations, hospital service, and TD, and doing procedures. Also, factors in logistic regression models that may influence the Odds Ratio (OR) for TD use during pandemic and for future use. Results: The percentages of responders providing in-person consultations (46.6% vs 100% before), and hospital service (27% vs 52.8% before), and doing procedures (25.6% vs 100% before) decreased while practicing TD increased three-fold (75.2% vs 26.1% before) during pandemic (P < .001 for each). Practice location was associated with TD use during the pandemic and with its expected use in the future (P < .001 for both), with North American responders indicating the highest use. TD use during the pandemic showed a positive correlation with TD use before, performing procedures and, more specifically, with biopsies of suspicious pigmented lesions during pandemic (P < .001 for each). TD use before pandemic was the most powerful predictor of TD use during pandemic (OR, 16.47 [95% CI, 7.12-38.06]). More than two thirds (68.6%) of participants expect to use TD in the future. The factor with the largest increase in OR on the expectation of future TD use was >1,000 COVID-19 cases in the country (OR, 3.80 [95% CI, 2.33-6.21]). Conclusions: This survey indicates a profound immediate effect of the pandemic on dermatology practice. The pandemic appears to have substantially contributed to an increased use of TD in the long-run.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dermatology practices: Results of a web-based, global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

HIV infection impairs gut homeostasis and is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 fatality. To investigate the potential link between these observations, we analyzed single-cell transcriptional profiles and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor expression across lymphoid and mucosal human tissue from chronically HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls. Absorptive gut enterocytes displayed the highest coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, of which ACE2 expression was associated with canonical interferon response and antiviral genes. Chronic treated HIV infection was associated with a clear antiviral response in gut enterocytes and, unexpectedly, with a substantial reduction of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 target cells. Gut tissue from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, however, showed abundant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in both the large and small intestine, including an HIV-coinfected individual. Thus, upregulation of antiviral response genes and downregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the GI tract of HIV-infected individuals does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this compartment.

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of XBJ for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to examine the potential effector mechanisms of XBJ on COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. Methods: : We searched Chinese and international papers to obtain the active ingredients of XBJ. Then, we compiled COVID-19 disease targets from the GeneCards gene database and via literature searches. Next, we used the SwissTargetPrediction database to predict XBJs effector targets and map them to the abovementioned COVID-19 disease targets in order to obtain potential therapeutic targets of XBJ. Cytoscape software version 3.7.0 was used to construct a XBJ active-compound-potential-effector target network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and then to carry out network topology analysis of potential targets. We used the ClueGO and CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape to conduct gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment analysis of XBJs effector targets. We used AutoDock vina and PyMOL software for molecular docking. Results: : We obtained 144 potential COVID-19 effector targets of XBJ. Fourteen of these targets-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ), albumin ( ALB ), tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ), epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( MAPK1 ), Caspase-3 ( CASP3 ), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ), MAPK8 , prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 ( PTGS2 ), JUN , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ), estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ), and MAPK14 had degree values >40 and therefore could be considered key targets. They participated in extracellular signalCregulated kinase 1 and 2 ( ERK1 , ERK2 ) cascade, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, activation of MAPK activity, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, and other inflammation- and immune-related BPs. XBJ exerted its therapeutic effects through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), MAPK , phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ( PI3K )-protein kinase B ( Akt )-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF, and inflammatory-mediator regulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) signaling pathways to ultimately construct a drug-ingredient-target-pathway effector network. The molecular docking results showed that the core 18 effective ingredients had a docking score of less than -4.0 with those top 10 targets. Conclusion: The active ingredients of XBJ regulated different genes, acted on different pathways, and synergistically produced anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects, which fully demonstrated the synergistic effects of different components on multiple targets and pathways. Our study demonstrated that key ingredients and their targets have potential binding activity, the existing studies on the pharmacological mechanisms of XBJ in the treatment of sepsis and severe pneumonia, could explain the effector mechanism of XBJ in COVID-19 treatment, and those provided a preliminary examination of the potential effector mechanism in this disease.","output":"Examining the effector mechanisms of Xuebijing Injection on COVID-19 based on network pharmacology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combined with sanitation and social distancing measures, control of human mobility has quickly been targeted as a major leverage to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a great majority of countries worldwide. The extent to which such measures were successful, however, is uncertain (Gibbs et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Very few studies are quantifying the relation between mobility, lockdown strategies and the diffusion of the virus in different countries. Using the anonymised data collected by one of the major social media platforms (Facebook) combined with spatial and temporal Covid-19 data, the objective of this research is to understand how mobility patterns and SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave are connected in four different countries: the west coast of the USA, Colombia, Sweden and France. Our analyses suggest a relatively modest impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus at the national scale. Despite a varying impact of lockdown on mobility reduction in these countries (83% in France and Colombia, 55% in USA, 10% in Sweden), no country successfully implemented control measures to stem the spread of the virus. As observed in Hubei, it is likely that the virus had already spread very widely prior to lockdown; the number of affected administrative units in all countries was already very high at the time of lockdown despite the low testing levels. The second conclusion is that the integration of mobility data considerably improved the epidemiological model (as revealed by the QAIC). If inter-individual contact is a fundamental element in the study of the spread of infectious diseases, it is also the case at the level of administrative units. However, this relational dimension is little understood beyond the individual scale mostly due to the lack of mobility data at this scale. Fortunately, these types of data are getting increasingly provided by social media or mobile operators, and they can be used to help administrations to observe changes in movement patterns and/or to better locate where to implement disease control measures such as vaccination","output":"The effect of mobility restrictions on the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave: what are the impacts in Sweden, USA, France and Colombia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most severe challenges the world faces today.

Based on those observations, in this study, we propose an end-to-end model with multiple attention blocks to predict the binding affinity scores of drug-target pairs. Our proposed model offers the abilities to (i) encode the correlations between atoms by a relation-aware self-attention block and (ii) model the interaction of drug representations and target representations by the multi-head attention block. Experimental results of DTI prediction on two benchmark datasets show our approach outperforms existing methods, which are benefit from the correlation information encoded by the relation-aware self-attention block and the interaction information extracted by the multi-head attention block.

However, very little is understood about the linkages between climate actions and remittances at the household level. It is not clear how remittances can affect households responses to climate change. This paper presents evidence from analyses of the associations between remittances to households, their climate hazard exposure, and adaptation actors. It uses concurrent data on international remittances receipts, three climate change related hazards (flooding, intense and irregular rainfall), and main adaptation actors (self/family, community, government, and NGOs) from over 600 households in South Eastern Nigeria. The results showed that household incidence of remittances is low (15%) while exposure to climate hazards is higher (flooding: 41.2%, intense rainfall: 47.1%, irregular rainfall: 29.9%). Nominal (contingency coefficient) associations between remittances and household climate hazard exposure and remittances and household adaptation actors were mostly moderate and insignificant. Therefore, households that received remittances and those that did not were not significantly different in terms of their exposure to climate hazard and main actors in climate adaptation. Self/families were the main actors in household climate actions. Governments and NGO actors were less prominent. The results suggest that unregulated remittances have limited impact on household climate hazard exposure and adaptive actions. However, there are indications that the contribution of remittances to financing climate adaptation may be enhanced by addressing issues with cost of remitting and remittee understanding of climate change to increase remittances volumes, incidence, and use.","output":"Can remittances contribute to financing climate actions in developing countries?

Methods: Since the onset of the pandemic, more than 2,700 SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory samples have been randomly selected and sequenced in the Balearic Islands. Genetic diversity of circulating variants was assessed by lineage assignment of consensus whole genome sequences with PANGOLIN and investigation of additional spike mutations. Results: Consensus sequences were assigned to 46 different PANGO lineages and 75% of genomes were classified within a VOC, VUI, or VUM variant according to the WHO definitions. Highest genetic diversity was documented in the island of Majorca (42 different lineages detected). Globally, lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2/AY.X were identified as the 2 major lineages circulating in the Balearic Islands during the pandemic, distantly followed by lineages B.1.177/B.1.177.X. However, in Ibiza/Formentera lineage distribution was slightly different and lineage B.1.221 was the third most prevalent. Temporal distribution analysis showed that B.1 and B.1.5 lineages dominated the first epidemic wave, lineage B.1.177 dominated the second and third, and lineage B.1.617.2 the fourth. Of note, lineage B.1.1.7 became the most prevalent circulating lineage during first half of 2021; however, it was not associated with an increased in COVID-19 cases likely due to severe social restrictions and limited travels.

Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. METHODS: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: \\"What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens\\" was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. RESULTS: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were \\"very stressed\\" and 452 were \\"slightly worried\\" about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (&#967;23=11.76, P=.008), television (&#967;23=12.40, P=.006), YouTube (&#967;23=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (&#967;23=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health \\"not good\\" were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F1,637=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F1,637=14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said \\"good\\" than others; F1,637=13.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"What Media Helps, What Media Hurts: A Mixed Methods Survey Study of Coping with COVID-19 Using the Media Repertoire Framework and the Appraisal Theory of Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implication Statement Institutions have been faced with the unique challenge of continuing to deliver medical education to students in a COVID-19 environment.(1)(,)(2) Clinical skills teaching must be adapted to the pandemic environment, which begins with retaining Volunteer Patient (VP) engagement to facilitate the development of students patient care aptitudes.

However, despite substantial progress and extensive efforts, the identification and production of antigen-specific antibodies remains labor- and cost-intensive. We have advanced existing concepts to develop a highly efficient high-throughput protocol with proven application for the isolation of potent antigen-specific antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus 1, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus. It is based on computationally optimized multiplex primer sets (openPrimeR), which guarantee high coverage of even highly mutated immunoglobulin gene segments as well as on optimized antibody cloning and production strategies.

Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care - with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in IBD. In this Viewpoint, we share our experiences from a clinical and academic perspective in the United Kingdom, highlighting the early challenges encountered and consider implications for patients and staff at research sites, sponsors, research ethics committees, funders and regulators.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe complication of this disease and traditional ventilation strategies using ARDSNet protocol, including low tidal volumes, appear to cause barotrauma in COVID19 patients at a higher rate than non-COVID19 ARDS patients. The purpose of our retrospective chart review is to identify the incidence of barotrauma in COVID19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation here at SJMC. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to critical care units at SJMC with COVID19 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020-September 30, 2020. The sample included adult patients (over age 18) with ICD 10 Code for COVID19 (U07.1) and patients who were placed on mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours, from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Both ICD 10 codes and a chart search were utilized to determine which ventilated COVID19 patients developed barotrauma. Results: 140 COVID19 patients underwent mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 at our facility. 26 COVID19 patients (18.6%) met our inclusion criteria, developing barotrauma during their hospital admission, of which 25 (17.9%) underwent mechanical (invasive and/or non-invasive) ventilation. The 1 non-ventilated patient was found to have incidental pneumothorax on chest x-ray after a thoracentesis was performed. 80% of the patients were on non-invasive mechanical ventilation prior to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. The categorical breakdown of barotrauma was as follows: Pneumothorax 65.4%, subcutaneous emphysema 61.5%, pneumomediastinum 34.6% and pneumoperitoneum 7.7%. None of these patients had any previous history of documented barotrauma. At the time of barotrauma, 15.4% of patients were on NMB drips, 96.2% were on corticosteroids, 42.3% were undergoing proning and 92.3% were on sedation. Prior to the time of barotrauma, 17 patients were on volume control, 7 were on pressure control and 1 was not on mechanical ventilation. Of the 17 patients on volume control, only 1 patient was above the ARDSNet guideline of 6-8 mL/kg IBW. The 7 patients on pressure control had a PEEP ranging from 8 to 15 and a PIP ranging from 25 to 46.

Adults with PH are at potential risk for severe complications and high mortality due to associated comorbidities.

Several factors may be responsible for the low incidence of COVID-19 in children with PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease, testing is not universal, and patients may have followed more rigorously the Center for Disease Controls guidelines recommended for personal protection with mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand sanitization through ongoing health education. The small number of COVID-19 cases in patients with preexisting PH does not support that PH is protective for COVID-19. However, medications used to treat PH may have some protection against COVID-19.

DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Data were collected between 17 and 20 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2237 participants living in the UK aged 16C75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reporting having had arguments, felt angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19. Reporting having confronted or reported someone to the authorities, or that you had been confronted or reported to the authorities, for not wearing a face covering; not keeping your distance from others or being in too large a group; or alternatively following recommended measures too carefully. We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with anger and confrontation. RESULTS: Most participants reported having had arguments, feeling angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19 (56%, n = 1255). Twenty-two percent (n = 500) of participants reported that they had confronted or reported someone. Fourteen percent (n = 304) of participants reported that they had been confronted or reported by someone. Confronting someone, having been confronted and feeling angry or having had arguments were strongly associated with each other. Anger and confrontation were associated with younger age, greater likelihood of experiencing significant financial difficulties due to the pandemic, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 and getting information about COVID-19 from social media. CONCLUSIONS: Measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have caused considerable strain.

It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease.

Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles.

Study Design: We compared home temperature measurements from a convenience sample of 1180 individuals who reported being test positive for SARS-CoV-2 to an age, sex, and location matched control group of 1249 individuals who had not tested positive. Methods: All individuals monitored their temperature at home using an electronic smartphone thermometer that relayed temperature measurements and symptoms to a centralized cloud based, de-identified data bank. Results: Individuals varied in the number of times they monitored their temperature. When temperature was monitored for over 72 hours fever (> 37.6 C or 99.7 F or a change in temperature of > 1 C or 1.8 F) was detected in 73% of test positive individuals, a sensitivity comparable to rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests.

This fusion protein contained a LALA mutation that abrogates Fcr binding, but retains FcRN binding to prolong the half-life, as well as achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung lavage. Interestingly, a mutation in the catalytic domain of ACE2, MDR504, completely abrogated catalytic activity, but significantly increased binding to SARS-CoV2 spike protein in vitro. This feature correlated with more potent viral neutralization in a plaque assay. Parental administration of the protein showed stable serum concentrations with a serum half-life of ~ 145 hours with excellent bioavailability in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung.

Data from connected sensors, including wearables, referred to here as biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs), are capable of capturing adherence to both digital therapeutics and digital data collection procedures, thereby providing the opportunity to identify the determinants of adherence and thereafter, methods to maximize adherence. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the methods and definitions by which adherence has been captured and reported using BioMeTs in recent years. Identifying key gaps allowed us to make recommendations regarding minimum reporting requirements and consistency of definitions for BioMeT-based adherence data. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2014 and 2019, which deployed a BioMeT outside the clinical or laboratory setting for which a quantitative, nonsurrogate, sensor-based measurement of adherence was reported. After systematically screening the manuscripts for eligibility, we extracted details regarding study design, participants, the BioMeT or BioMeTs used, and the definition and units of adherence. The primary definitions of adherence were categorized as a continuous variable based on duration (highest resolution), a continuous variable based on the number of measurements completed, or a categorical variable (lowest resolution). RESULTS: Our PubMed search terms identified 940 manuscripts; 100 (10.6%) met our eligibility criteria and contained descriptions of 110 BioMeTs. During literature screening, we found that 30% (53/177) of the studies that used a BioMeT outside of the clinical or laboratory setting failed to report a sensor-based, nonsurrogate, quantitative measurement of adherence. We identified 37 unique definitions of adherence reported for the 110 BioMeTs and observed that uniformity of adherence definitions was associated with the resolution of the data reported. When adherence was reported as a continuous time-based variable, the same definition of adherence was adopted for 92% (46/50) of the tools. However, when adherence data were simplified to a categorical variable, we observed 25 unique definitions of adherence reported for 37 tools. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that quantitative, nonsurrogate, sensor-based adherence data be reported for all BioMeTs when feasible; a clear description of the sensor or sensors used to capture adherence data, the algorithm or algorithms that convert sample-level measurements to a metric of adherence, and the analytic validation data demonstrating that BioMeT-generated adherence is an accurate and reliable measurement of actual use be provided when available; and primary adherence data be reported as a continuous variable followed by categorical definitions if needed, and that the categories adopted are supported by clinical validation data and/or consistent with previous reports.","output":"Recommendations for Defining and Reporting Adherence Measured by Biometric Monitoring Technologies: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE We describe the use of proximal and distal endovascular coil embolization of the internal carotid artery followed by operative removal of a retained foreign object transecting the petrocavernous portion of the internal carotid artery.

He reported a headache at presentation, but remained neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Computed tomography imaging and subsequent angiography confirmed complete transection of the petrocavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery with effective tamponade by the knife blade in situ and satisfactory collateral flow across the Circle of Willis. Coil embolization of the left internal carotid artery was performed. Retrograde embolization of the petrocavernous internal carotid segment distal to the injury was performed via vertebral and posterior communicating artery access. Antegrade embolization of the internal carotid artery proximal to the injury was completed and the patient was transferred to the operating room for craniectomy and foreign body extraction. Postoperative computed tomography angiography revealed no parenchymal hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift, and successful embolization of the internal carotid artery.

Risk of APOL1 nephropathy is mostly confined to individuals with two APOL1 risk variants. However, only a minority of individuals with two APOL1 risk alleles develop kidney disease, suggesting the need for a second hit.

TS are highly N-glycosylated, but the biological functions of the glycans remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the influence of N-glycans on the enzymatic activity and structure stability of TconTS1, a recombinant TS from the African parasite Trypanosoma congolense. MALDI-TOF MS revealed that eight asparagine sites were glycosylated with high-mannose type N-glycans. Deglycosylation of TconTS1 led to a 5-fold decrease in substrate affinity but to the same conversion rate relative to the untreated enzyme. After deglycosylation, no changes in secondary structure elements were observed in circular dichroism experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed interactions between the highly flexible N-glycans and some conserved amino acids belonging to the catalytic site. These interactions led to conformational changes, possibly enhancing substrate accessibility and promoting enzyme/substrate complex stability. The here-observed modulation of catalytic activity via the N-glycan shield may be a structure-function relationship intrinsic of several members of the TS family.","output":"N-glycosylation modulates enzymatic activity of Trypanosoma congolense trans-sialidase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The potential risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is a concern in dental practice.

Among the potential determinants of screening uptake, only a few studies analysed the role of general practitioners (GPs). The aim was to evaluate the variation in screening uptake of the clusters of subjects assisted by single GPs. SETTING Ancona province, Central Italy. METHODS Cross-sectional study, including all residents aged 50-69 years, who were offered the public screening programme with biannual faecal immunochemical tests. Demographic (of all GPs) and screening data (of all eligible residents) for years 2018-2019 were collected from the official electronic datasets of the Ancona Local Health Unit. The potential predictors of acceptable screening uptake, including GP's gender, age, and number of registered subjects, were evaluated using random-effect logistic regression, with geographical area as the cluster unit. RESULTS The final sample consisted of 332 GP clusters, including 120,178 eligible subjects. The overall province uptake was 38.0%  10.7%. The uptake was lower than 30% in one-fifth of the GP clusters, and higher than 45% in another fifth. At multivariable analysis, the significant predictors of uptake were younger GP age (p = 0.010) and lower number of registered subjects (p < 0.001). None of the GP clusters with 500 subjects or more showed an uptake 45%.

The virus superantigen could overstimulate anti-virus immune responses, and thereby induce negative feedback loops, that paradoxically allow the virus to persist.

Access and provider issues were more commonly reported by LMIC respondents. Overall, respondents reported uncertainty among parents and healthcare providers regarding routine immunization. We conclude that further quantification of routine vaccination disruption is needed, alongside health service prioritization, logistical support and targeted communication strategies to reinforce routine immunizations during the COVID-19 response.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Immunization Services for Maternal and Infant Vaccines: Results of a Survey Conducted by ImprintThe Immunising Pregnant Women and Infants Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPLICATIONS: This commentary addresses the state of the evidence on tobacco products, nicotine, and COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated how residents in various specialties in the United States were impacted by COVID-19 on mental wellbeing and resilience levels, and the methodology for coping with the stress incurred. METHODS: In April 2020, the authors electronically surveyed 200 residency programs of all specialties nationally. The survey utilized two validated questionnaires to assess wellbeing and resilience, while investigating demographics and coping mechanisms. The authors used student t-test and ANOVA to quantitatively analyze the data. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1115 respondents (with an 18% response rate). Male gender & Age >39 years were associated with more favorable average well-being indices (both p<0.01). Regarding resources, institutional support (IS) appeared favorable for resident well-being (IS 2.74, SD1.96 vs NoIS 3.71, SD2.29, p<0.01) & resilience (IS 3.72, SD0.70 vs NoIS 3.53, SD0.73, p = 0.05). The effects of mindfulness practices (MP) were not statistically significant for improvement of wellness (MP 2.87, SD 1.99 vs No MP 2.76, SD 2.15, p = 0.85) or resilience (MP 3.71, SD 0.70 vs No MP 3.72, SD 0.68, p = 0.87).

Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.","output":"Immune Responses to rAAV6: The Influence of Canine Parvovirus Vaccination and Neonatal Administration of Viral Vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) has rapidly evolved over the last 20 years. Major advances have led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of 7 HER2-targeted therapies for the treatment of early-stage and/or advanced-stage disease. Although oncologic outcomes continue to improve, most patients with advanced HER2-positive BC ultimately die of their disease because of primary or acquired resistance to therapy, and patients with HER2-positive early BC who have residual invasive disease after preoperative systemic therapy are at a higher risk of distant recurrence and death.

Further, apart from providing informative content to the public, the incessant media coverage of COVID-19 crisis in terms of news broadcasts, published articles and sharing of information on social media have had the undesired snowballing effect on stress levels (further elevating depression and drug use) due to uncertain future. In this position paper, we propose a novel framework for assessing the spatio-temporal-thematic progression of depression, drug abuse, and informativeness of the underlying news content across the different states in the United States. Our framework employs an attention-based transfer learning technique to apply knowledge learned on a social media domain to a target domain of media exposure. To extract news articles that are related to COVID-19 communications from the streaming news content on the web, we use neural semantic parsing, and background knowledge bases in a sequence of steps called semantic filtering. We achieve promising preliminary results on three variations of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. We compare our findings against a report from Mental Health America and the results show that our fine-tuned BERT models perform better than vanilla BERT.

The epithelial barrier constitutes the first line of physical, chemical and immunological defense against environmental factors. Recent reports have shown that industrial products disrupt the epithelial barriers. Innate and adaptive immune responses play an important role in the epithelial barrier damage. In addition, recent studies suggest that epithelial barrier dysfunction plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the atopic march by allergen sensitization through the transcutaneous route. It is evident that external factors interact with the immune system triggering a cascade of complex reactions that damage the epithelial barrier. Epigenetic and microbiome changes modulate the integrity of the epithelial barrier. Robust and simple measurements of the skin barrier dysfunction at the point-of-care are of significant value as a biomarker, as recently reported using electrical impedance spectroscopy to directly measure barrier defects. Understanding epithelial barrier dysfunction and its mechanism is key to developing novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases.

Here we review the major oral and maxillofacial mycoses of COVID-19, the associated comorbidities, and the probable precipitating factors. METHODS: English language manuscripts published between March 2020 and October 2021 were searched using PubMed, OVID, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases, using appropriate keywords. RESULTS: We identified 30 articles across 14 countries, which met the inclusion criteria of PRISMA guidelines. These yielded a total of 292 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 51.4% (n=150) of whom presented with oral and maxillofacial fungal infections, mainly comprising candidosis, mucormycosis, and aspergillosis. Candidal infections were the most prevalent, present in 64% (n = 96), followed by mucormycosis, and only a single case of aspergillosis was noted. Oral and maxillofacial mycoses were predominantly seen in those with comorbidities, especially in diabetics (52.4%). Oral mucormycosis was noted in 8.6% (n=13) and mainly manifested on the hard palate. An overall event rate of oral/maxillofacial mucormycosis manifestation in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus Type 1/2 was around 94% (49/52; 95% CI: 0.73%-0.89%), implying a very high association between diabetes mellitus and the latter condition. All fungal infections appeared either concurrently with COVID-19 symptoms or during the immediate recovery period.

In this work, polyethylene MPs and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were applied to a soil microcosm to investigate the CIP degradation behavior and their combined effects on soil microbial communities. Compared with that of the individual amendment of CIP, the co-amendment of CIP and MPs reduced the CIP degradation efficiency during the 35 d cultivation period. In addition, the high-throughput sequencing results illustrated that the combined loading of MPs and CIP in soil significantly decreased the microbial diversity compared with that of individual contamination. As for the community structure, the microbial compositions at the phylum level were consistent among all treatments, and the most dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. At the genus level, only one genus, namely Arthrobacter, was remarkably changed in the CIP-amended soil compared with that in the blank control, but four genera were significantly altered in the MPs-CIP co-amended soil. Serratia and Achromobacter were abundant in the combined polluted soil, which might have been involved in accelerated depletion of soil total nitrogen based on redundancy analysis.

This peptide corresponds to the sequence 24C42 of the ACE2 1 domain, which marks the binding site for the S1 protein. The kinetics of S1-ACE2 complex formation was measured in the presence of various concentrations of the peptide using bio-layer interferometry. Formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was inhibited by the peptide in cases where it was preincubated with S1 protein before the binding experiment. The kinetic analysis of S1-ACE2 complex dissociation revealed that preincubation stabilized this complex, and this effect was dependent on the peptide concentration as well as the preincubation time. The results point to the formation of the ternary complex of S1 with ACE2 and the peptide. This is possible in the presence of another binding site for the S1 protein beside the receptor-binding domain for ACE2, which binds the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ.

METHODS: Delphi statements were directly mapped to guidance from surgical professional bodies in the US and Europe (SAGES/EAES), the UK (Joint RCS), and Australasia (RACS), to validate content against international consensus. Agreement from &#8805;70% participants was determined as consensus agreement. RESULTS: The Delphi exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries and 52 statements were mapped to the guidance, 47 (90.4%) reaching consensus agreement. Of these, 27 statements were mapped to SAGES/EAES guidance, 21 to the Joint RCS document, and 33 to the RACS document. Within the SAGES/EAES document, 92.9% of items reached consensus agreement (median 89.0%, range 60.5-99.2%), 90.4% within the Joint RCS document (87.6%, 63.4-97.9%), and 90.9% within the RACS document (85.5%, 18.7-98.8%).

The severity is not easily predicted via currently used biomarkers. Critical COVID-19 patients need to be screened for hyperinflammation to improve mortality but expensive cytokine measurement is not routinely conducted in most laboratories. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a novel biomarker in patients with various diseases. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of the NLR in COVID-19 patients.Methods: We searched for relevant articles in seven databases. The quantitative analysis was conducted if at least two studies were evaluating the NLR role in COVID-19.Results: We included 8,120 individuals, including 7,482 COVID-19 patients, from 32 articles. Patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of NLR compared to negative individuals. Advanced COVID-19 stages had significantly higher levels of NLR than earlier stages.Expert Opinion: We found significantly higher levels of NLR in advanced stages compared to earlier stages of COVID-19 with good accuracy to diagnose and predict the disease outcome, especially mortality prediction. A close evaluation of critical SARS-CoV-2 patients and efficient early management are essential measures to decrease mortality.

Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","output":"Staffing Levels and COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in U.S. Nursing Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to put forward a definition of corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) which is relevant to the study of complex organizations and in particular, the multinational enterprise (MNE). This paper then offers a framework as a foundation to discuss the institutional complexity of CSI to aid international business (IB) scholars, practitioners and policymakers achieve a clearer understanding of the mechanisms that may penalize and subsequently deter MNE irresponsibility.Design/methodology/approachIn presenting the approaches taken by social regulation researchers and IB policy scholars to understand MNE irresponsibility, this paper proposes a definition of CSI and explicates the various mechanisms associated with deterring MNEs from behaving irresponsibly.FindingsTherefore, how can MNEs be deterred from behaving irresponsibly? To further the research agenda concerning CSI in IB, far less common are a definition of CSI relevant to the complex IB context;and a framework that explicates both the legal and social components of CSI, particularly as they unfold in a complex, diverse and often divergent institutional landscape. Overcoming these two primary obstacles is important because when complexities associated with CSI emerge, researchers need to be able to ascertain and expound upon what they are observing so that comparisons can be made and more MNE CSI research can be accrued over time.Research limitations/implicationsTo help the development of future research, we offered a more precise definition of CSI, one which is more relevant to the study of the MNE and the complex contemporary IB environment. By embracing complexities, this paper also outlines an institutional complexity approach, one which highlights both the role of formal and informal regulatory institutions. Though IB has traditionally focused on the role of formal regulation, there is much more to be unearthed by exploring the additional and concurrent influence of social regulatory institutions.Practical implicationsThere is a high level of heterogeneity in the motivations and modes used by MNEs to enter international markets, which likely influence efforts made by these firms to adapt to different types of formal and social institutional pressures. When firms invest significantly in a market, they have a greater economic dependence in that market and institutions have a greater opportunity to exert pressures. For instance, foreign direct investment requires a higher level of (longer-term) commitment, transfer of capital, exchange of expertise and learning, meaning that firms depend much more on local authorities to perform in the market and accomplish their goals.Social implicationsEnabled by new technologies and, particularly, social media platforms, stakeholders can now engage in organized forms of regulatory activities, as is evident in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, black lives matter and gender equality social activist movements. Through prominent collective actions, the impacts of globally organized social movements may be increasingly non-location bound, placing MNE managers at the heart of new challenges and opportunities to engage with global stakeholders. Infomediaries such as the press, have always been of historical importance, due to their role in shaping stakeholder expectations and opinions of the firm and thus, the reputation and legitimacy of that firm.Originality/valueThis study enriches the understanding of what CSI is, why we are likely to observe it in practice and how it affects MNEs. This paper offers a definition of CSI that is sufficiently nuanced to capture the complexity of the contemporary IB environment, as well as a framework that, this paper proposes, presents a clearer understanding of the institutional mechanisms that may deter MNEs from behaving irresponsibly. By encouraging scholars to examine the institutional complexity of MNE CSI, the paper hopes to contribute toward building a bridge which connects the IB policy and social regulation research streams.","output":"Defining and deterring corporate social irresponsibility: embracing the institutional complexity of international business"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to study the economic impact of COVID-19. To do that, in the first step, I showed that the adjusted SEQIER model, which is a generalization form of SEIR model, is a good fit to the real COVID-induced daily death data in a way that it could capture the nonlinearities of the data very well. Then, I used this model with extra parameters to evaluate the economic effect of COVID-19 through job market. The results show that there was a simple strategy that US government could implemented in order to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19. Because of that the answer to the paper's title is yes. If lockdown policies consider the heterogenous characteristics of population and impose more restrictions on old people and control the interactions between them and the rest of population the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people lives and US economy reduced dramatically. Specifically, based on this paper's results, this strategy could reduce the death rate and GDP loss of the United States 0.03 percent and 2 percent respectively. By comparing these results with actual data which show death rate and GDP loss 0.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively, we could figure out that death rate reduction is 0.07 percent which means for the same percent of GDP loss executing optimal targeted policy could save 2/3 lives. Approximately, 378,000 persons dead because of COVID-19 during 2020, hence reducing death rate to 0.03 percent means saving around 280,000 lives, which is huge.","output":"COVID Lessons: Was there any way to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on the United States economy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal of this paper is to illustrate recruitment efforts, strategies, and challenges in the process of training bilingual school psychologists to serve diverse schools.

A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used on SPSS version 25 to identify factors related to the knowledge and prevention practice of HWs on COVID-19. Significance was determined at a p value of < 0.05 and association was described by using odds ratio at 95% CI. RESULTS: Of 442 HWs, 398 (90% response rate) responded to the online interview questionnaire. From 398 HWs, 231(58%), 225(56%), 207(53%), and 191(48%) were males, from rural area, aged  34 years and nurses, respectively. About 279(70%) HWs had good knowledge of COVID-19 followed by 247(62%) good prevention practices.

To date, no work has assessed how this guidance differs across governments. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to contribute to a rational and consistent global response to infectious disease by determining how guidelines differ across nations and regions. METHODS: A content analysis of health agency mask guidelines on agency websites was performed in late March 2020 among 25 countries and regions with large numbers of COVID-19 cases. Countries and regions were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency, with Google Translate used as needed. When available, both the original and English language version of guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: All examined countries and regions had some form of guidance online, although detail and clarity differed. Although 9 countries and regions recommended surgical, medical, or unspecified masks in public and poorly ventilated places, 16 recommended against people wearing masks in public. There were 2 countries that explicitly recommended against fabric masks. In addition, 12 failed to outline the minimum basic World Health Organization guidance for masks.

Experts from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) involved in the Trial moderated the session. The practice suggestions in this statement were from a targeted literature review and expert opinion. RESULTS A high prevalence of MMC in Asia supports an effort to adopt the procedure, but only in established FTCs with good maternal and neonatal ancillary supports. The falling incidence of MMCs may affect case volume and maintenance of skill. A regional approach was recommended. Fetal benefits have to be weighed against maternal risks, with a consideration of recent outcome data from the endoscopic approach. Responsible FTCs need standardized diagnosis and management, with their long-term outcome data available for an audit.

The Seventh International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VII C June 2022) is an excellent opportunity to rethink literacy from a lifelong learning perspective in order to fully tap its transformative potential in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By using a theoretical framework of lifelong literacy, this article analyses the main challenges associated with applying the lifelong learning principle to literacy, in particular in the context of aligning CONFINTEAs review and improvement of adult learning and education (ALE) strategies with SDG processes. The authors demonstrate that a limited understanding of literacy as part of lifelong learning still prevails, and that literacy promotion suffers from ambiguity and dissonances. They also provide analyses of literacy policies, strategies and programmes that have been successful in adopting a lifelong learning approach, drawing out some important lessons on how this can be achieved.

In the present study, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) day/night band (DNB)-extracted night-time lights (NTL) data were explored for damage assessment caused by extremely severe cyclonic storm AMPHAN that struck one of the most populous regions in India. The disaster impact was measured on two parameters: population and crop land area, where NTL density and population density were found to be strongly correlated (r(2) > 0.8). From power outage intensity, three crisis zones indicating the severity of cyclone damage were identified. Finally, the assessment found that the total affected population and crop land area were nearly 70% and 66%, respectively, of the study area. Therefore, NPP-VIIRS DNB image-based rapid damage assessment is potentially a useful tool for generating first hand information about the physical damages caused by extreme events.

Monitoring temperature currently requires invasive probes. This work investigates a novel foam-based flexible sensor worn behind the ear for the measurement of core body temperature. This observational study uses the device prototype and clinical data to compare three methods for calculating the temperature from this sensor: a basic heat-flow model, a new dynamic model that addresses changing surrounding temperatures and one that combines the dynamic model with a correction for adhesive quality. Clinical validation was performed with 21 surgical patients (average length of surgery 4.4 h) using an esophageal temperature probe as reference. The operative period was divided into four segments: normal periods (with stable surrounding temperatures), surrounding temperatures increasing due to the use of the Bair Hugger?, stable periods during Bair Hugger? use and surrounding temperatures decreasing due to its removal. The error bias and limits of agreement over these segments were on average of - 0.05  0.28 C (95% limits of agreement) overall. The dynamic model outperformed the simple heat-flow model for periods of surrounding temperature changes (12.7% of total time) while it had a similar, high, performance for the temperature-stable periods. The results suggest that our proposed topical sensor can replace invasive core temp sensors and provide a means of consistently measuring core body temperature despite surrounding temperature shifts.","output":"Perioperative measurement of core body temperature using an unobtrusive passive heat flow sensor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The alphacoronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are sources of high morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs, a consequence of dehydration caused by the infection and necrosis of enterocytes.

METHODS: A mixed methods online questionnaire developed by National Institute for Health Research Mental Health Policy Research Unit was used to gather staff perspectives on their challenges at work, problems faced by service users and their carers, and sources of help and support. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative analysis and descriptive content analysis for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: 158 participants, working in either community or inpatient settings, and from a range of professional disciplines, were included. For inpatient staff, a significant challenge was infection control. In the community, staff identified a lack of access to physical and social care as well as reduced contact with friends and families as being challenges for patients. Remote working was seen as a positive innovation along with COVID\\\\19 related guidance from various sources and peer support.

Background - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has generated serious repercussions on the health system, reducing the number of all cardiology procedures worldwide. OBJECTIVES: Describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the procedures performed by the electrophysiology department in a national referral center. METHODS: We made a retrospective review of our data base and we compared procedures made in the last 3 years since 2017 to 2019 with the procedures made in the 2020. We divide the procedures into two large groups: Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) related procedures (which included implants, revisions, changes, upgrades and extractions) and electrophysiological studies and ablations (which included conventional and complex procedures). Other types of procedures were no included. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all procedures, the average of procedures performed in the last 3 previous years was 467 (there were 479 in 2017, 411 in 2018 and 511 in 2019), while in 2020 we performed only 319 (p = 0.01); this represents a reduction of 33.4% in the total number of procedures performed in our center. There was no statistical difference regarding the CIED related procedures, the average of procedures of the last 3 previous years was 174 (there were 186 in 2017, 148 in 2018 and 188 in 2019), and in 2020 we performed 189 procedures, this value is near to the average of the last 3 previous years and very close to the value of the 2019 (p = 0.46). Regarding the electrophysiological studies and ablations, the average of procedures of the last 3 previous years was 293 (there were 293 in 2017, 263 in 2018 and 323 in 2019), while in 2020 we performed only 129 procedures, considerably decreasing compared to the previous years (p < 0.01). The reduction in the electrophysiological studies and ablations was 55.97%. The most affected months were April, May and June. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic considerably affected the number of electrophysiological procedures in our center, reducing it by 33.4% compared to the previous years. The reduction of procedures fundamentally affected the electrophysiological studies and ablations, reducing them by 55.97%.

Transport medicine faces unique challenges in the care of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In particular, the multitude of providers, confined spaces for prolonged time periods, varying modes (ground, rotor wing, fixed wing) of transport, and need for frequent aerosol-generating procedures place transport personnel at high risk. This study describes the clinical practices, personal protective equipment, and potential exposure risks of a large cohort of neonatal and pediatric interfacility transport teams. Methods Data for this study came from a survey distributed to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Transport Medicine. Results Fifty-four teams responded and 47 reported transporting COVID-19 positive patients. Among the 47 teams, 25% indicated having at least one team member convert to COVID-19 positive. A small percentage of teams (40% ground, 40% fixed wing, 18% rotor wing) reported allowing parental accompaniment during transport. There was no difference in teams with a positive team member among those that do (26%) and do not (25%) allow parents. There was a higher percentage of teams with a positive team member among teams that intubate (32% vs 0%) and place LMAs (34% vs 0%) during transport. Conclusions Our study shows that exceptional care during interfacility transport, including a family-centered approach, can continue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From our perspective nanotechnology is revealed as a vital resource for this, as a generic platform of technical solutions to tackle complex medical challenges. It is towards this perspective and focusing on nanomedicine that we take issue with Prof Park's recent editorial published in the Journal of Controlled Release. Prof. Park argued that in the last 15 years nanomedicine failed to deliver the promised innovative clinical solutions to the patients (Park, K. The beginning of the end of the nanomedicine hype. Journal of Controlled Release, 2019; 305, 221C222 [1]. We, the ETPN (European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine) [2], respectfully disagree. In fact, the more than 50 formulations currently in the market, and the recent approval of 3 key nanomedicine products (e. g. Onpattro, Hensify and Vyxeos), have demonstrated that the nanomedicine field is concretely able to design products that overcome critical barriers in conventional medicine in a unique manner, but also to deliver within the cells new drug-free therapeutic effects by using pure physical modes of action, and therefore make a difference in patients lives. Furthermore, the >400 nanomedicine formulations currently in clinical trials are expecting to bring novel clinical solutions (e.g. platforms for nucleic acid delivery), alone or in combination with other key enabling technologies to the market, including biotechnologies, microfluidics, advanced materials, biomaterials, smart systems, photonics, robotics, textiles, Big Data and ICT (information & communication technologies) more generally. However, we agree with Prof. Park that  it is time to examine the sources of difficulty in clinical translation of nanomedicine and move forward . But for reaching this goal, the investments to support clinical translation of promising nanomedicine formulations should increase, not decrease. As recently encouraged by EMA in its roadmap to 2025, we should create more unity through a common knowledge hub linking academia, industry, healthcare providers and hopefully policy makers to reduce the current fragmentation of the standardization and regulatory body landscape. We should also promote a strategy of cross-technology innovation, support nanomedicine development as a high value and low-cost solution to answer unmet medical needs and help the most promising innovative projects of the field to get better and faster to the clinic. This global vision is the one that the ETPN chose to encourage for the last fifteen years. All actions should be taken with a clear clinical view in mind,  without any fanfare, to focus on what matters in real life, which is the patient and his/her quality of life. This ETPN overview of achievements in nanomedicine serves to reinforce our drive towards further expanding and growing the maturity of nanomedicine for global healthcare, accelerating the pace of transformation of its great potential into tangible medical breakthroughs.","output":"Delivering the power of nanomedicine to patients today"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respiratory tract surface is protected from inhaled pathogens by a secreted layer of mucus rich in mucin glycoproteins. Abnormal mucus accumulation is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases, but the relationship between mucus and pathogens during exacerbations is poorly understood. We identified elevations in airway mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) and MUC5B concentrations during spontaneous and experimentally induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. MUC5AC was more sensitive to changes in expression during exacerbation and was therefore more predictably associated with viral load, inflammation, symptom severity, decrements in lung function, and secondary bacterial infections. MUC5AC was functionally related to inflammation, as Muc5ac-deficient (Muc5ac(C/C)) mice had attenuated RV-induced (RV-induced) airway inflammation, and exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented inflammatory responses and increased the release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in mice and human airway epithelial cell cultures. Hydrolysis of ATP suppressed MUC5AC augmentation of RV-induced inflammation in mice. Therapeutic suppression of mucin production using an EGFR antagonist ameliorated immunopathology in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. The coordinated virus induction of MUC5AC and MUC5B expression suggests that non-Th2 mechanisms trigger mucin hypersecretion during exacerbations. Our data identified a proinflammatory role for MUC5AC during viral infection and suggest that MUC5AC inhibition may ameliorate COPD exacerbations.","output":"Airway mucins promote immunopathology in virus-exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) pose a continuous background threat to the global health. Knowledge of the occurrence, distributions and epidemiological characteristics of VBP are lacking in many countries. Outbreaks of novel VBP are of increasing global interest including those arising in China. METHODS: A systematic review of published literature was undertaken to characterize the spectrum of VBPs causing human illness in China. We searched five databases for VBP-related articles in English and Chinese published between January 1980 and June 2021, that excluded those listed in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System of China. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021259540. FINDINGS: A total of 906 articles meeting the selection criteria were included in this study. A total of 44,809 human infections with 82 species of VBPs including 40 viruses, 33 bacteria (20 Rickettsiales bacteria, eight Spirochaetales bacteria, and five other bacteria) and nine parasites, were identified in China. Rickettsiales bacteria were the most common and widely distributed pathogens with 18,042 cases reported in 33 provinces by 347 reviewed articles, followed by Spirochaetales bacteria with 15,745 cases in 32 provinces (299 articles), viruses with 8455 cases in 30 provinces (139 articles), other bacteria with 2053 cases in 19 provinces (65 articles), parasites with 514 cases in 17 provinces (44 articles), and multiple pathogens with 3626 cases in 14 provinces (23 articles). Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella henselae and Rickettsia sibirica were the most frequently reported pathogens. A total of 18 new pathogens were reported in China during this period (these also represented their first identification globally). Based on 419 articles with clinical information, a meta-analysis revealed that flu-like illness was the most common manifestation among infections with VBPs. INTERPRETATION: This review helps improve the understanding of VBPs in China, demonstrating the need to consider a wider surveillance of VBPs in many different settings, thus helping to inform future research and surveillance efforts.

In the dermatological setting, patients with stable plaque psoriasis on maintenance therapy with biological drugs may be suitable candidates for telemedicine, although their preference for telemedicine has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the preference for telemedicine versus in-person visit among patients with psoriasis receiving biological drugs and the reported reasons behind their preferences. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI]  3 for at least 12 months) receiving maintenance biological therapy answered a survey investigating whether they would choose telemedicine or in-person visit for the next scheduled visit and the reasons behind their preference. The survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was developed according to a structured process. RESULTS: Of the 246 participants in the survey, 118 (48%) preferred telemedicine over an in-person visit for their next scheduled visit with a dermatologist. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that previous experience with digital video-communication tools was a significant predictor for the preference for telemedicine (odds ratio [OR] 10.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.61C32.03), while older age (< 60 years) was negatively associated with the preference for telemedicine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10C0.90). The most common reasons (75%) for preferring telemedicine were saving time and safety in relation to the risk presented by the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic (38%). In contrast, 56% of the patients who preferred the in-person visit option declared that they were unable to use video-communication tools. CONCLUSION: About half of the patients with stable psoriasis receiving biological drugs may be good candidates for telemedicine.

However, parasite infections continued to affect children mostly in resource-limited countries, of which the African continent has one of the highest burdens of diseases. The application of school-based approaches has several advantages where the structure of healthcare systems is not optimal. In Africa, soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis are frequently targets for school-based public health intervention. Mass drug administration (MDA) by teachers at school can reach targeted children effectively and safely. Limitations of this approach include missing unattended children and absentee of teachers. Initially, MDA at school for parasitic infections was thought to improve health and even socioeconomic status of children in the community. However, more recently the socioeconomic impact has been questioned although the reduction of parasitic diseases is still apparent. Moreover, other basic public health measurements such as increased toilet use, assuring safe water access and avoiding human excrement as agricultural fertilizers, are equally important for control and prevention of parasitic diseases.

The biosensor is based on indirect competition between free virus in the sample and immobilized MERS-CoV protein for a fixed concentration of antibody added to the sample. Voltammetric response is detected by monitoring the change in the peak current (typically acquired at a working potential of ?0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) after addition of different concentrations of antigen against MERS-CoV. Electrochemical measurements using ferrocyanide/ferricyanide as a probe were recorded using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Good linear response between the sensor response and the concentrations from 0.001 to 100 ng.mL(?1) and 0.01 to 10,000 ng.mL(?1) were observed for MERS-CoV and HCoV, respectively.

Treatment with chlorpromazine, sucrose, ethyl-isopropyl amiloride, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 all significantly decreased STIV infection, suggesting that STIV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis to enter cells via a pH-dependent pathway. Depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl--cyclodextrin significantly inhibited STIV entry, but neither filipin III nor nystatin did, suggesting that STIV entry was cholesterol dependent but caveola independent. Treatment with dynasore, genistein, ML-7 or cytochalasin D all significantly inhibited STIV infection, indicating that Rac GTPase and myosin II activity were required for the macropinocytosis-like pathway as well as actin polymerization. Our findings suggest that the molecular events involved in STIV entry are not identical to those of other ranavirus isolates.

One of the possible options for severe COVID-19 treatment may be the transfusion of hyperimmune SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma. A 9-month-old girl with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia received an HSCT from a haploidentical donor. On day +99, during routine virologic monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 was detected without any clinical symptoms.

Therapy with tocilizumab and three doses of fresh frozen plasma was well tolerated. In spite of full resolution of the lung lesions, complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2 has not been achieved 4 months after the first detection, which is due to persistence of secondary immunodeficiency after HSCT and the lack of reconstitution of the adaptive immune response. This case represents a demonstration of an atypical course of COVID-19 and the delayed development of lung lesions, which was most likely associated with the features of the patient's immune status after HSCT.

Since many people have been vaccinated with various types of vaccines, it is crucial to develop a high throughput platform for measuring the antibody responses and surrogate neutralizing activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. To meet this need, the present study developed a SARS-CoV-2 variant (CoVariant) array which consists of the extracellular domain of spike variants, e.g., wild-type, D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and B.1.617.3. A surrogate virus neutralization on the CoVariant array was established to quantify the bindings of antibody and host receptor ACE2 simultaneously to spike variants. By using a chimeric anti-spike antibody, we demonstrated a broad binding spectrum of antibodies while inhibiting the bindings of ACE2 to spike variants. To monitor the humoral immunities after vaccination, we collected serums from unvaccinated, partial, or fully vaccinated individuals with either mRNA-1273 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1). The results showed partial vaccination increased the surrogate neutralization against all the mutants while full vaccination boosted the most.

Rapid genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered the scientific community to search for effective vaccines. Collaborative approaches from research institutes and biotech companies have acknowledged the use of viral proteins as potential vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) vaccines are considered the next generation vaccines as they can be rapidly designed to encode any desirable viral sequence including the highly conserved antigen sequences. RNA vaccines being less prone to host genome integration (cons of DNA vaccines) and anti-vector immunity (a compromising factor of viral vectors) offer great potential as front-runners for universal COVID-19 vaccine. The proof of concept for RNA-based vaccines has already been proven in humans, and the prospects for commercialization are very encouraging as well. With the emergence of COVID-19, mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna, Inc. was the first to enter human trials, with the first volunteer receiving the dose within 10 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing.

In Ireland, the National Ambulance Service established a novel home and community testing service that was central to the national COVID-19 screening programme. This service was overseen by a multidisciplinary response room. This research examined the response room service, particularly areas that performed well and areas requiring improvement, using a quality improvement (QI) framework. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study comprising semi-structured, individual interviews. Maximum variation sampling was used. The data were analysed using an established thematic analysis procedure. The analysis was guided by the framework, which comprised six QI drivers. SETTING: Response room employees, including clinicians, dispatchers and administrators, were interviewed via telephone. RESULTS: Leadership for quality: participants valued person-oriented leadership, including regular, open communication and consultation with staff. Person/family engagement: participants endeavoured to provide patient-centred care. Formal patient feedback mechanisms and shared decision-making could be beneficial in the future. Staff engagement: working in a response room could affect well-being, though it also provided networking and learning opportunities. Staff require support and teambuilding. Use of improvement methods: improvements were made in a relatively informal, ad hoc manner. The use of robust methods based on improvement science was not reported. Measurement for quality: data were collected to improve efficiency and accuracy. More rigorous measurement would be beneficial, especially formally collecting stakeholder feedback. Governance for quality: close alignment with collaborators and clear communication with staff are essential.

Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested as a potential risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although its impact on the prognosis of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is associated with hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (n = 220) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were categorized as follows: <10 ng/mL, 10 to <20 ng/mL, 20 to <30 ng/mL, and 30 ng/mL, and <10 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and the secondary outcomes were the rate of patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hospital length of stay when the 4 25(OH)D categories were compared (P = 0.120). Patients exhibiting 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL showed a trend (P = 0.057) for longer hospital length of stay compared with those with 25(OH)D 10 ng/mL [9.0 d (95% CI: 6.4, 11.6 d) vs. 7.0 d (95% CI: 6.6, 7.4 d)]. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard models showed no significant associations between 25(OH)D and primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, those with severe 25(OH)D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) exhibited a trend for longer hospital length of stay compared with patients with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. This association was not significant in the multivariable Cox regression model. Prospective studies should test whether correcting severe 25(OH)D deficiency could improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Influence of vitamin D status on hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: a multicenter prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Higher education (HE) serves to produce well trained and job-ready graduates. Despite this belief, whether HE produces certificates/qualifications or job-ready graduatesthis debate remains unsettled. To date, the current COVID-19 pandemic which erupted in late 2019 continues to create much economic, social and political dislocation throughout the world. Consequently, one outcome for HE during this crisis is the much greater dependence on online/digital technology to deliver courses and programs. Although it is not considered to be a complete substitute, critics argue that education delivered through online technology has expended the diploma disease crisis and subsequently may pose a threat to the viability of producing HE graduates. It has been suggested that this can result in significant long-term problems that may be impossible to recover from. This study was based on a empirical survey where the sample incorporated 240 people in two groups (before and during COVID-19, for a total of 120 in each), and the objective was to examine academic and job-readiness of graduates in greater depth. Findings demonstrate that pre-pandemic students scored poorly academically compared to their post-pandemic classmates. Pre-pandemic graduates, on the other hand, had higher work readiness scores in terms of both aptitude and practical aspects. Furthermore, both groups outperformed their job-readiness scores in terms of learning performance. This raises the question: is it the job of higher education to promote sustainable production of graduates or deliver certificates and degrees? COVID-19 appears to have been utilised by the HE system as an excuse to exacerbate the diploma disease crisis, a scenario that must be resolved by developing a proper policy framework that allows HE to play the necessary role in an emergency.

Purmorphamine is a smoothened-sonic-hedgehog agonist that has a protective effect against many neurological diseases due to its role in maintaining functional connectivity during CNS development and its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. As part of our current research, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of PUR against behavioral and neurochemical changes in 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder in rats. Additionally, the effect of PUR was compared with the standard drug for OCD, i.e., fluvoxamine. The intra-dorsal raphe-nucleus injection of 8-OH-DPAT in rats for seven days significantly showed OCD-like repetitive and compulsive behavior along with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, as well as neurotransmitter imbalance. These alterations were dose-dependently attenuated by long-term purmorphamine treatment at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p. In this study, we assessed the level of various neurochemical parameters in different biological samples, including brain homogenate, blood plasma, and CSF, to check the drugs effect centrally and peripherally. These effects were comparable to the standard oral treatment withfluvoxamine at 10 mg/kg. However, when fluvoxamine was given in combination with purmorphamine, there was a more significant restoration of these alterations than the individualtreatmentswithfluvoxamine and purmorphamine.

Protein annotation, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, functional classification, functional enrichment and cluster, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed. Furthermore, western blotting was used to validate the changed protein levels. RESULTS A total of 6498 proteins were identified, of which 5520 proteins were quantified. The fold-change cutoff was set at 1.2; 132 proteins were upregulated, and 104 proteins were downregulated. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in the cholesterol metabolism, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Remarkably, the processes related to the change of oxidative phosphorylation including the NADH dehydrogenase, Cytochrome C reductase, Cytochrome C oxidase and F-type ATPase were significantly upregulated, which were further verified by western blotting.

The use of molecular techniques to assess the genetic heterogeneity of Blastocystis sp. has become important to understand its function in some intestinal pathologies and if it is a key component of intestinal microbiota. Spondyloarthritis is a group of immune-mediated autoinflammatory diseases in which microbial dysbiosis in the gut (including parasites, bacteria and fungi) and intestinal inflammation are common features apparently associated with the pathophysiology of these disorders. This study included 74 patients diagnosed with spondyloarthritis and 57 systemically healthy individuals (included as controls), who were screened for intestinal parasites. Blastocystis sp. was detected in 68% and 73% of the patients with spondyloarthritis and controls, respectively. In faecal samples positive for Blastocystis sp., an 18S rRNA gene fragment of Blastocystis sp. was amplified and sequenced to identify their genetic sub-types. Patients with spondyloarthritis showed similar frequencies of ST1, ST2 and ST3 subtypes of Blastocystis sp. (30% each). The same subtypes were observed in controls, wherein almost 60% of the samples showed ST3. In addition, ST6 was found only in one sample from each group. ST1 subtype showed the greatest genetic variability. Although the same subtypes were detected in both patients with spondyloarthritis and controls, subtype prevalence studies conducted in Colombia indicate an association between ST3 and individuals with irritable bowel syndrome.

The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) has prescribed a framework with five domains consisting of 36 indicators for primary healthcare performance assessment from a policy point of view. For the assessment to be realistic, it should include inputs from stakeholders involved in care delivery, so this study examines the perspectives of healthcare providers at PHCs in India. METHODOLOGY The authors used qualitative research methodology in the form of responsive evaluations of healthcare provider's interviews to understand the indicators of PHC performance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The study results showed that healthcare providers considered efficient teamwork, opportunities for enhancing provider skills and knowledge, job satisfaction, effective PHC administration, and good community relationship as PHC performance assessment. These domains of performance could be considered the 'missing link' in PHC assessment, since they are deemed important by providers and did not coincide with the WHO aspects and the PHCPI performance assessment framework.","output":"Providers' perspectives on the performance of primary healthcare centres in India: The missing link."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection and management of diseases become quite complicated when pathogens contain asymptomatic phenotypes amongst their ranks, as evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease.

We consider the concept and a typical multi-structural model of GVCs, highlighting the network complexity of the system of distributed production and trade in value added. Not only does this system bring competitive advantages to GVC part- ner countries, but also it entails risks of cascading production disruptions. We examine these risks by analysing the ripple effect of supply disruptions in GVCs when a sudden local shock can propagate globally through inter-firm supplier links, generating growing output losses across industries and economies. From this perspective, we describe the pandemic-induced breakdown in the global just-in-time supply system in spring 2020 and its role in the escalating global recession. In analysing the mechanisms of post -pan- demic GVC adaptation to uncertainty, we look at the concept of economic resilience and properties of resilient systems (robustness, flexibility, redundancy, and dynamic sustain -ability). We scrutinise the supply chain resilience model used by leading MNEs (GVC organisers) in their disruption risk management at pre-disruption and post-disruption stages. We classify resilience strategies devised by MNEs after 2020 into three interrelat- ed categories: namely, multi-structural GVC optimisation (diversification and relocation of suppliers), operational optimisation (building redundancy and production flexibility), and GVC digitalisation. We conclude by outlining windows of opportunity to improve international specialisation and growth patterns, which may open in the 2020s for devel- oping economies, including Russia, due to the ongoing restructuring of GVCs and their global supplier networks.","output":"Global Value Chains in the Age of Uncertainty: Advantages, Vulnerabilities, and Ways for Enhancing Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Several criteria have been described to noninvasively predict the presence of high-risk esophageal varices in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD).

Patients with cACLD and liver stiffness measurement (LSM)  10 kPa with esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed within one year of VCTE were analyzed. We generated a novel score to predict esophageal varices, using the beta coefficient of predictive variables. The score was validated in an external cohort at the University of Iowa Hospital, USA. RESULTS There were 372 patients in the development cohort and 200 patients in the validation cohort. LSM, platelet count, and albumin were identified as predictors of esophageal varices and were included for generating the Cook County score as \\"platelet count * - 0.0155872 + VCTE score * 0.0387052 + albumin * - 0.8549209.\\" The area under receiver operating curve for our score was 0.86 for any varices and 0.85 for high risk varices and avoided more endoscopies than the expanded Baveno VI criteria while maintaining a very low miss rate (negative predictive value > 99%).

In response, the government unveiled a plan called Saudi Vision 2030 in 2016 which has triggered structural economic reforms leading to an unprecedented strategy of transition from an oil-driven economy to a modern market economy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper forecasts with spectral analysis economic indicators of the Saudi economy up to 2030 to provide a clearer picture of the future economy assuming that the effects of recent reforms have not yet been traced by most of the economic indicators. Findings - 2018-2030 forecasts are all bearish except West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price expected to average $64.40 during the period 2019-2030. Two additional exceptions are the Saudi population that should grow to 40 million in 2030 and the swelling gross domestic product (GDP) generated by the non-oil sector resulting from bold actions of the Saudi government who is willing to become less dependent on revenues generated by the oil sector.

Infections with each of these pathogens are becoming more frequent, particularly in the case of hospital-acquired infections. Like most other bacterial species of clinical importance, antimicrobial resistance (and, specifically, multi-drug resistance) is an increasing threat, with both species considered to be of particular importance by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control. The threat of antimicrobial resistance is exacerbated by the staggering difference in the speeds of development for the discovery and development of the antimicrobials versus resistance mechanisms. In the search for alternative strategies, modulation of host-pathogen interactions in general, and virulence inhibition in particular, have drawn substantial attention. Unfortunately, these approaches require a fairly comprehensive understanding of virulence determinants. This requirement is complicated by the fact that enterococcal infection models generally require vertebrates, making them slow, expensive, and ethically problematic, particularly when considering the thousands of animals that would be needed for the early stages of experimentation. To address this problem, we developed the first high-throughput C. elegansCE. faecium infection model involving host death. Importantly, this model recapitulates many key aspects of murine peritonitis models, including utilizing similar virulence determinants. Additionally, host death is independent of peroxide production, unlike other E. faeciumCC. elegans virulence models, which allows the assessment of other virulence factors. Using this system, we analyzed a panel of lab strains with deletions of targeted virulence factors. Although removal of certain virulence factors (e.g., fms15) was sufficient to affect virulence, multiple deletions were generally required to affect pathogenesis, suggesting that host-pathogen interactions are multifactorial. These data were corroborated by genomic analysis of selected isolates with high and low levels of virulence.

We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05). Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

In this study, we extended the molecular and functional characterization to the various NK cell-triggering receptors using PBMC and to the in vitro-derived NK cell populations by cytofluorometry and by cytolytic activity assays. In addition, RT-PCR strategy, cDNA cloning/sequencing, and transient transfections were used to identify and characterize NKp80, NKG2D, CD94/NKG2C, and CD94/NKG2A in M. fascicularis and Macaca mulatta as well as in the signal transducing polypeptide DNAX-activating protein DAP-10. Both M. fascicularis and M. mulatta NK cells express NKp80, NKG2D, and NKG2C molecules, which displayed a high degree of sequence homology with their human counterpart. Analysis of NK cells in simian HIV-infected M. fascicularis revealed reduced surface expression of selected NK cell-triggering receptors associated with a decreased NK cell function only in some animals. Overall surface density of NK cell-triggering receptors on peripheral blood cells and their triggering function on NK cell populations derived in vitro was not decreased compared with uninfected animals. Thus, triggering NK cell receptor monitoring on macaque NK cells is possible and could provide a valuable tool for assessing NK cell function during experimental infections and for exploring possible differences in immune correlates of protection in humans compared with cynomolgus and rhesus macaques undergoing different vaccination strategies.","output":"Molecular and functional characterization of NKG2D, NKp80, and NKG2C triggering NK cell receptors in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques: monitoring of NK cell function during simian HIV infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic can have important psychosocial consequences in the population.

It is considered a promising and safe alternative pain therapy. Different targets have been tested, each having their own particular mechanisms for modulating pain perception. AREAS COVERED: We discuss the current state of the art of tDCS to manage pain and future strategies to optimize tDCS' effects. Current strategies include primary motor cortex tDCS, prefrontal tDCS and tDCS combined with behavioral interventions while future strategies, on the other hand, include high intensity tDCS, transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulation, cerebellar tDCS, home-based tDCS and tDCS with extended number of sessions. EXPERT COMMENTARY: It has been shown that the stimulation of the prefrontal and primary motor cortex is efficient for pain reduction while a few other new strategies, such as high intensity tDCS and network-based tDCS, are believed to induce strong neuroplastic effects, although the underlying neural mechanisms still need to be fully uncovered. Hence, conventional tDCS approaches demonstrated promising effects to manage pain and new strategies are under development to enhance tDCS effects and make this approach more easily available by using, for instance, home-based devices.","output":"Methods and strategies of tDCS for the treatment of pain: current status and future directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of infection control procedures in hospital radiology departments has become increasingly apparent in recent months as the impact of COVID-19 has spread across the world Existing disinfectant procedures that rely on the manual application of chemical-based disinfectants are time consuming, resource intensive and prone to high degrees of human error Alternative non-touch disinfection methods, such as Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI), have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of existing approaches while significantly improving workflow and equipment utilization The aim of this research was to investigate the germicidal effectiveness and the practical feasibility of using a robotic UVGI device for disinfecting surfaces in a radiology setting We present the design of a robotic UVGI platform that can be deployed alongside human workers and can operate autonomously within cramped rooms, thereby addressing two important requirements necessary for integrating the technology within radiology settings In one hospital, we conducted experiments in a CT and X-ray room In a second hospital, we investigated the germicidal performance of the robot when deployed to disinfect a CT room in &lt;15 minutes, a period which is estimated to be 2-4 times faster than current practice for disinfecting rooms after infectious (or potentially infectious) patients Findings from both test sites show that UVGI successfully inactivated all of measurable microbial load on 22 out of 24 surfaces On the remaining two surfaces, UVGI reduced the microbial load by 84 and 95%, respectively The study also exposes some of the challenges of manually disinfecting radiology suites, revealing high concentrations of microbial load in hard-to-reach places Our findings provide compelling evidence that UVGI can effectively inactivate microbes on commonly touched surfaces in radiology suites, even if they were only exposed to relatively short bursts of irradiation Despite the short irradiation period, we demonstrated the ability to inactivate microbes with more complex cell structures and requiring higher UV inactivation energies than SARS-CoV-2, thus indicating high likelihood of effectiveness against coronavirus","output":"Exploring the Applicability of Robot-Assisted UV Disinfection in Radiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory viral illness that can have life threatening complications.

Learners who showed deficiencies in proficiency participated in live-streamed coaching sessions. The coaching sessions continued until the learner and coach mutually agreed that the learner was prepared for the skills portion of the FLS certification exam. The primary outcome was learner performance on skills assessment with external validation through the FLS manual skills exam pass rate. RESULTS: One learner demonstrated proficiency at baseline and the remaining nine underwent remote coaching sessions. Learners received a mean of two coaching sessions to reach mutually agreed readiness for the FLS exam as per learner and coach. All residents performed significantly better at the conclusion of the remote coaching series (11.3  0.82) as compared to their baseline scores (8.8  2.82) (P < .03; 95% CI, 0.31-4.69). Proficiency was externally validated through the FLS exam taken by each resident 1-2 weeks following their final assessment, with all learners passing the manual portion. The average satisfaction of learners with remote coaching was 77/100 (range 50-100). 100% of learners felt prepared for their FLS certification exam and 100% would recommend this remote training program to a colleague.

However, the impact of COVID-19 on all-cause mortality rates in incarcerated populations has not been studied. Methods Using data reported by the Florida Department of Corrections on prison populations and mortality events we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals incarcerated in Florida state prisons between 2015 and 2020. We calculated excess deaths by estimating age-specific expected deaths from mortality trends in 2015 through 2019 and taking the difference between observed and expected deaths during the pandemic period. We calculated life table measures using standard demographic techniques and assessed significant yearly changes using bootstrapping. Findings The Florida Department of Corrections reported 510 total deaths from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 among the state prison population. This was 42% higher (rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.89) than the expected number of deaths in light of mortality rates for previous years. Reported COVID-19 deaths in a month were positively correlated with estimated excess deaths (80.4%, p <.01).

Interpretation The Florida prison population saw a significant increase in all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period, leading to a decrease in life expectancy of more than four years. Life years lost by the Florida prison population were likely far greater than those lost by the general United States population, as reported by other studies.

With the current routine use of ultrasound in pediatric patients the ulnar is as accessible as the radial and could be viewed as an equivalent site for cannulation. AIMS The purpose of this study was to compare ulnar and radial artery suitability for arterial cannulation in pediatric patients using 2-dimensional ultrasound. METHODS We examined the ulnar and radial arteries of pediatric patients aged birth to 6 years who were scheduled to undergo general anesthesia. Following anesthesia induction, the investigators positioned the patient's wrist to 30-45 degrees of extension and obtained images of the ulnar and radial arteries in the transverse and longitudinal planes. Assessments of the arteries' anterior-posterior diameter, cross-sectional area and depth were made by visual inspection at the time of image acquisition and by electronic caliper measurement of recorded images. RESULTS In 108 patients, mean anterior-posterior diameter of the ulnar artery was larger than the radial artery in the transverse view, longitudinal view, and cross-sectional area in 63.6%, 59.4%, and 60.4% of patients (p = 0.002, 0.004, and 0.006, respectively). Mean ulnar artery size was, on average, larger than the radial artery by 7.7%, 8.1% and 12.9% in the transverse AP diameter, longitudinal AP diameter, and cross-sectional area (95% CI 3.1%-12.4%; 3.2%-13.0%; 4.4%-21.5%). The investigator's visual evaluation of vessel size at the bedside showed substantial agreement with the measured cross-sectional area (linear-weighted kappa of 0.73). In a subset of 13 patients age < 24 months the mean depth of the ulnar artery was 2.13mm compared to 1.65mm for the radial artery (difference -0.48mm 95% CI 1.08-0.12). CONCLUSIONS The ulnar artery was larger than the radial artery in 60% of pediatric patients thus may offer an arterial cannulation site advantage due to its larger size. The use of 2-dimensional ultrasound examination allows accurate assessment of upper extremity distal arteries in order to optimize site selection for arterial cannulation in pediatric patients.","output":"The ulnar artery: a site suitable for arterial cannulation in pediatric patients.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus, and Kaposis sarcomaCassociated herpesvirus (KSHV) has a restricted seroprevalence. Both viruses are associated with malignancies that have an increased frequency in individuals who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Methods. To obtain an overview of humoral immune responses to these viruses, we generated a protein array that displayed 174 EBV and KSHV polypeptides purified from yeast. Antibody responses to EBV and KSHV were examined in plasma from healthy volunteers and patients with B cell lymphoma or with AIDS-related Kaposis sarcoma or lymphoma. Results. In addition to the commonly studied antigens, IgG responses were frequently detected to the tegument proteins KSHV ORF38 and EBV BBRF and BGLF2 and BNRF1 and to the EBV early lytic proteins BRRF1 and BORF2. The EBV vIL-10 protein was particularly well recognized by plasma IgA. The most intense IgG responses to EBV antigens occurred in HIV-1Cpositive patients. No clear correlation was observed between viral DNA load in plasma and antibody profile. Conclusions. The protein array provided a sensitive platform for global screening; identified new, frequently recognized viral antigens; and revealed a broader humoral response to EBV compared with KSHV in the same patients.","output":"Comparison of Humoral Immune Responses to Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposis SarcomaCAssociated Herpesvirus Using a Viral Proteome Microarray"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the addiction services with an unprecedented set of challenges.

STUDY DESIGN: All 90 patients hospitalized between March 16 and April 30, 2003, were included. Epidemiological and clinical data were shared with the French National Institute for Health. Cases were classified according to both the official definition (possible, probable, excluded) and a local one, adapted from the official definition but including an additional level of suspicion (equivocal), intermediate between possible and excluded. RESULTS: The initial assessment was different in 39% of the cases (n = 35), according to epidemiological (n = 24) or clinical (n = 11) elements. The final assessment diverged in 54% of the cases (n = 47). All patients were officially considered as \\"excluded\\" for epidemiologists, while 47 remained as \\"possible\\" or \\"equivocal\\" cases of SARS according to the clinicians. CONCLUSION: The risk assessment was different in almost 40% of the cases, with no impact on epidemic diffusion or hospital-borne exposure as no probable case of SARS was diagnosed among these patients or their households. The confrontation of these different but complementary points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks.","output":"Prise en charge de 90 patients suspects de syndrome respiratoire aigu svre.

A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). RESULTS Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.","output":"Fever range whole body hyperthermia for re-irradiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: Final results of a prospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin (IVM) belongs to the class of macrocyclic lactones, which is used as an antiparasitic agent.

It is assumed that IVM affects chloride channels and increases cytoplasmic concentration of chloride. This study examines the effect of IVM on chloride currents induced by glycine (IGly). Experiments were carried out on isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus with whole-cell patch clamp. A short-term (600 msec) application of IVM in a concentration of 10 M induced a slow inward current, which persisted after washing the neurons. The low concentrations (0.1-1000 nM) of IVM did not induce any novel current, but it rapidly and reversibly reduced the peak amplitude and accelerated desensitization of IGly in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentrations of IVM sufficient to reduce peak amplitude of IGly and to accelerate desensitization of IGly were 100 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively.

We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were &#8805;95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs &#8805; 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were &#8805;95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.","output":"Temporal Course of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Positivity in Patients with COVID-19 following the First Clinical Presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intramuscular fat content is an important determinant of meat quality, and preadipocyte differentiation plays a critical role in intramuscular fat deposition in pigs. However, many types of RNA differentiation, including messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) remain unreported despite their crucial roles in regulating adipogenesis. Chinese Guizhou Congjiang pigs are raised in the Guizhou province of China for their high-quality meat. Therefore, it is important for breeders to explore the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes from the longissimus dorsi muscle of these pigs. In the present study, a transcriptome analysis of intramuscular preadipocytes from Chinese Guizhou Congjiang pigs, including analyses of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs at days 0 (D0), 4 (D4), and 8 (D8) was performed. A total of 1,538, 639, and 445 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 479, 192, and 126 DE lncRNAs, and 360, 439, and 304 DE circRNAs were detected between D4 and D0, D8 and D0, and D8 and D4, respectively. Functional analyses identified many significantly enriched RNAs related to lipid deposition, cell differentiation, metabolism processes, and obesity-related diseases, biological processes, and pathways. We identified two lncRNAs (TCONS_00012086 and TCONS_00007245) closely related to fat deposition according to their target genes and tissue expression profiles. Subcellular distribution analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that both TCONS_00012086 and TCONS_00007245 are cytoplasmic lncRNAs.

There is an assumption that online teaching limits opportunities for fostering interpersonal relationships and students satisfaction of the basic need for relatedness C reflected by experiencing meaningful interpersonal connections and belonging C which are considered important prerequisites for student motivation and vitality. In educational settings, an important factor affecting students relatedness satisfaction is the teachers behavior. Although research suggests that relatedness satisfaction may be impaired in online education settings, to date no study has assessed how university lecturers relatedness support might be associated with student relatedness satisfaction and therefore, student motivation and vitality. This study tested this mediating relationship using data collected during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also investigated whether the relations were moderated by a high affiliation motive which reflects a dispositional wish for positive and warm relationships. The possible importance of the communication channel selected by the lecturers (video chat yes/no) and the format of a class (lecture/seminar) were also investigated. In a sample of N = 337 students, we tested our hypotheses using structural equation model (SEM). Results confirmed mediation, but not moderation.

Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants. 12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after vaccination. Author Summary The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.","output":"The influence of major S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on the potential B cell epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient who presented to hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with sporadic CreutzfeldtCJakob disease (sCJD).

SUMMARY: In a health system based in Illinois and Wisconsin, pharmacy services are provided by a single, integrated department responsible for all aspects of pharmaceutical care within the organization. Hospital, retail, ambulatory care, and population health services are all managed under one leadership team. All pertinent ancillary services are also managed within the department, including informatics, supply chain, and drug policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacy services leadership has successfully managed volume and capacity challenges by redirecting resources to where they are needed. A disaster response framework based on Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance was put in place, and change management principles were used to rapidly operationalize change. Components of the nimble response have included quickly increasing capacity, thoughtful and timely communication to all team members, strategic decision making with available data, creating an agile pool of labor, and maintaining an efficient system supply chain. Well-being and resilience are emphasized alongside reflection on lessons learned. Some changes made in the urgent response to the pandemic are being considered for long-term implementation. CONCLUSION: Organizations have the potential to respond to almost any situation if they are integrated and teams work together to build flexibility.

We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Consquences psychopathologiques du confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the current complex economic situation and the impact of COVID-19, Chinas capital market reform has entered a critical period, with opportunities and challenges coexisting. One of the important challenges is how to improve the well-being of investors in capital markets. Financial education, which has been offered by financial institutions in many countries in recent years, is likely to become an effective policy instrument to meet this challenge. Using survey data of individual investors from China, this study examines the potential impact of financial education programs offered by financial institutions on individuals investment diversification. The results show financial education is positively associated with the investment diversification of individual investors. An analysis of the underlying mechanism shows that financial education contributes to the improvement of investment diversification by mitigating limited attention bias, strengthening social trust, and promoting the use of professional investment advisors. These findings suggest that the persistent promotion of financial education programs has a positive effect on optimizing financial asset allocation decisions and improving financial welfare of Chinese households. ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","output":"Can financial education improve consumer welfare in investment markets?

While the efficacy of vaccines and coronavirus drugs are being tested, the microbiome approach represents an alternative pathophysiology-based approach to prevent the severity of the infection. In the current study, we evaluated the action of a novel probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum Probio-88 against SARS-COV-2 replication and immune regulation using an in vitro and in silico study. The results showed that extract from this strain (P88-CFS) significantly inhibited the replication of SARS-COV-2 and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, compared with infected cells, P88-CFS treated cells showed a significant reduction in inflammatory markers such as IFN-, IFN-, and IL-6. Using an in silico molecular docking approach, it was postulated that the antiviral activity of L. plantarum Probio-88 was derived from plantaricin E (PlnE) and F (PlnF). The high binding affinity and formation of hydrogen bonding indicated that the association of PlnE and PlnF on SARS-COV-2 helicase might serve as a blocker by preventing the binding of ss-RNA during the replication of the virus.

METHOD: Between 9 and 11 November 2020, 1153 US adults completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) on Phase 2 of the CDC Vaccination Program (August 2021). Each of its eight choice tasks had three vaccination alternatives and \\"no vaccination for 6 months.\\" An opt-out inflated logit model was estimated to test for respondent differences and attribute effects. RESULTS: Respondent demographics were unrelated to one's willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75-90% needed for herd immunity.

This study, therefore, investigates the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on entertainment (music, television and special events). Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources, the study showed that the impact of the pandemic was devastating on the sector, leading to multibillion-dollar losses for global entertainment companies. Global entertainment companies such as Walt Disney World and Box Office suffered massive losses, which forced several companies to furlough employees and executives in the battle for survival and to protect capital.

The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from beta class of corona viruses has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of virus. OBJECTIVE The current review put the light on structural aspects for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues. RESULTS Recently, several studies are being conducted for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. CONCLUSION Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values) which will help for further improvement in the selectivity.","output":"Inhibition of S-protein RBD and hACE2 Interaction for Control of SARSCoV-2 Infection (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because ACE2 is a host cell receptor of the SARS-CoV-2, an investigation of ACE2 expression in normal and virus-infected human tissues is crucial for understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified pathways associated with ACE2 expression and gene co-expression networks of ACE2 in pan-tissue based on the gene expression profiles in normal human tissues. We found that the pathways significantly associated with ACE2 upregulation were mainly involved in immune, stromal signature, metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and cancer and other diseases. The number of genes having a significant positive expression correlation with ACE2 in females far exceeded that in males. The estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR) genes had a significant positive expression correlation with ACE2. Meanwhile, the enrichment levels of immune cells were positively associated with the expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2, while they were inversely associated with the expression levels of AR in pan-tissue and multiple individual tissues. It suggests that females are likely to have a more robust immune defense system against SARS-CoV-2 than males. ACE2 was upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues relative to normal tissues and in SARS-CoV-2-infected males relative to females, while its expression levels had no significant difference between healthy females and males. Numerous immune-related pathways were highly enriched in SARS-CoV-2-infected males relative to females. These data indicate that males are more susceptible and more likely to have an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection than females. This study furnishes potentially cues explaining why females have better clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections than males and warrant further investigation for understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Identifying Pathways and Networks Associated With the SARS-CoV-2 Cell Receptor ACE2 Based on Gene Expression Profiles in Normal and SARS-CoV-2-Infected Human Tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To examine changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting/reduction behaviour following the Covid-19 lockdown in England. Design/setting: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019 through February 2020) versus after (April 2020) the lockdown. Participants: 20,558 adults ([a?]16y). Measurements: The independent variable was the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England (before vs. after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support/websites/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). Findings: The Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), OR=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[1.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadj=2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]). Conclusions: In England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher. Smokers are no less likely than before lockdown to use cessation support, with increased uptake of remote support. However, use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers has decreased, with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","output":"Association of the Covid-19 lockdown with smoking, drinking, and attempts to quit in England: an analysis of 2019-2020 data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In 2020, the long-lasting effects of the Covid-19 virus were not included in public messages of risks to public health.

METHODS Unlike any previous pandemic in history, online Covid communities and 'citizen science' have played a leading role in advancing our understanding of Long Covid. As patient-led research of this grassroots Covid community, a team approach to thematic analysis was undertaken of 66 patient stories submitted online to covid19-recovery.org at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic between April and September 2020. RESULTS The overriding theme of the analysis highlights the complexities and challenges of living with Long Covid.

The control over the spread of the disease requires an efficient and scalable laboratory-based strategy for testing the population based on multiple platforms to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis. With the onset of the pandemic, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has become a standard diagnostic tool, which has received wide clinical use. In large-scale and repeated examinations, these tests can identify infected patients with COVID-19, with their accuracy, however, dependent on many factors, while the entire process takes up to 6-8 h. Here we also describe a number of serological systems for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These are used to assess the level of population immunity in various categories of people, as well as for retrospective diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in patients. However, the widespread use of traditional diagnostic tools in the context of the rapid spread of COVID-19 is hampered by a number of limitations. Therefore, the sharp increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 necessitates creation of new rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific tests. In this regard, we focus on new laboratory technologies such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), which have proven to work well in the COVID-19 diagnostics and can become a worthy alternative to traditional laboratory-based diagnostics resources. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system requires a combination of various types of laboratory diagnostic testing techniques, whodse sensitivity and specificity increases with the progress in the SARS-CoV-2 research.

In our knowledge, this is the first report of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed on a COVID-19 patient. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A COVID-19 patient was diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis and a multidisciplinary team decided to perform a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) as the first treatment. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not found in the bile fluid. Because of deterioration of the patient's clinical conditions, laparoscopic cholecystectomy had to be performed and since the gallbladder was gangrenous, the severe inflammation made surgery difficult to perform. DISCUSSION: Acalculous cholecystitis was related with mechanical ventilation and prolonged total parenteral nutrition, in this case the gangrenous histopathology pattern and the gallbladder wall ischemia was probably caused by vascular insufficiency secondary to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome of COVID-19 pneumonia. The percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTBD) was performed according to Tokyo Guidelines because of high surgical risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was next performed due to no clinical improvement. The absence of viral RNA in the bile highlights that SARS-CoV-2 is not eliminated with the bile while it probably infects small intestinal enterocytes which is responsible of gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Although the lack of evidence and guidelines about the management of patient with acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at most preceded by PTGBD on high surgical risk patients, remains the gold standard for the treatment of acute cholecystitis on COVID-19 patients.","output":"Acute acalculous cholecystitis on a COVID-19 patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vitamin D deficiency is a pandemic disorder affecting over 1 billion of subjects worldwide Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) represents the perpetrator of the several systemic effects of vitamin D, including the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic action potentially preventing acute cardiovascular ischemic events Variability in the transformation of vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D has been suggested to modulate its cardioprotective benefits, however, the determinants of the levels of calcitriol and their impact on the cardiovascular risk have been seldom addressed and were therefore the aim of the present study Methods A consecutive cohort of patients undergoing coronary angiography for acute coronary syndrome(ACS) were included The levels of 25 and 1,25(OH)2 D were assessed at admission by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON?

METHODS: The authors analyzed epidemiological investigation forms and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) of entrants to Incheon International Airport between March 11 to April 30, 2020. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the odds of positive SARS-CoV-2 result. RESULTS: A total of 11,074 entrants underwent reverse-transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2, resulting 388 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 had a strong association with the reported loss of smell or taste and association with self-reported fever, chill, cough, and vomiting. If a traveler reported contact with an individual with either respiratory symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 in the last two weeks directly prior to landing, the probability of a positive result was increased. CONCLUSION: If overseas travelers experience loss of smell or taste in the two weeks prior to arrival, they may require an immediate examination to rule out COVID-19 at a port of entry. As to measure body temperature upon arrival at a port of entry, it is important to screen for any occurrence of fever within the two weeks prior to travel. Also, information with epidemiological relevance, such as recent contact with an individual suffering from any respiratory symptoms or with confirmed COVID-19, should be included in COVID-19 screening questionnaires for international travelers.","output":"Symptoms and Characteristics Which Require Attention During COVID-19 Screening at a Port of Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"So far COVID-19 has resulted in mass deaths and huge economic losses across the world. Various measures such as quarantine and social distancing have been taken to prevent the spread of this disease. These prevention measures have changed the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and introduced new challenges for epidemic modelling and prediction. In this paper, we study a novel disease spreading model with two important aspects. First, the proposed model takes the quarantine effect of confirmed cases on transmission dynamics into account, which can better resemble the real-world scenario. Second, our model incorporates two types of human mobility, where the intra-region human mobility is related to the internal transmission speed of the disease in the focal area and the inter-region human mobility reflects the scale of external infectious sources to a focal area. With the proposed model, we use the human mobility data from 24 cities in China and 8 states in the USA to analyse the disease spreading patterns. The results show that our model could well fit/predict the reported cases in both countries. The predictions and findings shed light on how to effectively control COVID-19 by managing human mobility behaviours.","output":"Modelling the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 with consideration of human mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy C a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability C has the potential to threaten the successful roll-out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. Here, we evaluate the potential impact of vaccine hesitancy on the control of the pandemic and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) by combining an epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data on vaccine hesitancy from population surveys. Our findings suggest that the mortality over a 2-year period could be up to 8 times higher in countries with high vaccine hesitancy compared to an ideal vaccination uptake if NPIs are relaxed. Alternatively, high vaccine hesitancy could prolong the need for NPIs to remain in place. Addressing vaccine hesitancy with behavioural interventions is therefore an important priority in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Quantifying the impact of vaccine hesitancy in prolonging the need for Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Poor outcomes have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); thus, it is mandatory to explore novel therapeutic approaches for this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study, sitagliptin, an oral and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, was added to standard of care (e.g., insulin administration) at the time of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Every center also recruited at a 1:1 ratio untreated control subjects matched for age and sex. All patients had pneumonia and exhibited oxygen saturation <95% when breathing ambient air or when receiving oxygen support. The primary end points were discharge from the hospital/death and improvement of clinical outcomes, defined as an increase in at least two points on a seven-category modified ordinal scale. Data were collected retrospectively from patients receiving sitagliptin from 1 March through 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Of the 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 admitted in Northern Italy hospitals included in this study, 169 were on sitagliptin, while 169 were on standard of care. Treatment with sitagliptin at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality (18% vs. 37% of deceased patients; hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.29C0.66]; P = 0.0001), with an improvement in clinical outcomes (60% vs. 38% of improved patients; P = 0.0001) and with a greater number of hospital discharges (120 vs. 89 of discharged patients; P = 0.0008) compared with patients receiving standard of care, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, sitagliptin treatment at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality and improved clinical outcomes as compared with standard-of-care treatment.

Hence, the present study is aimed to explore antibacterial activity of marine cyanobacterium against MDR pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cyanobacterial samples were collected and isolated from Thondi Palk Strait region. The isolate was subjected to polarity based solvent extraction and checked for their antibacterial activity against test bacterial pathogens. The active principles from chloroform extract of Oxynema thaianum (CEOT) were partially purified through thin layer chromatography (TLC). The active principle with highest activity was further characterized by FTIR, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Among the eight extracts tested, CEOT showed effective zone of clearance against ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in disc diffusion method. In TLC, all the purified five fractions were eluted and tested for their antibacterial activity against test pathogens. The third fraction showing maximum activity was subjected to HPLC analysis for checking its purity. In GC-MS analysis, 9-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester and hexadecanoic acid were identified as the major chemical compounds. CONCLUSION: Hence, the present study was concluded that O. thaianum ALU PBC5 is a promising agent to treat ESBL producing MDR bacterial pathogens.

Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drugCgene or dugCdrug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management.

Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001).

Health facility closures and travel restrictions disrupted access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for people living with HIV. This report describes how HIV programs in Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, and Nigeria supported treatment continuation by introducing home delivery of ARVs. METHODS: Staff supporting the programs provided accounts of when and how decisions were taken to support ARV home delivery. They captured programmatic information about home delivery implementation using an intervention documentation tool. The 4 country experiences revealed lessons learned about factors favoring successful expansion of ARV home delivery. RESULTS: Three of the countries relied on existing networks of community health workers for ARV delivery; the fourth country, Indonesia, relied on a private sector courier service. Across the 4 countries, between 19% and 51% of eligible clients were served by home delivery. The experiences showed that ARV home delivery is feasible and acceptable to health service providers, clients, and other stakeholders. Essential to success was rapid mobilization of stakeholders who led the design of the home delivery mechanisms and provided leadership support of the service innovations. Timely service adaptation was made possible by pre-existing differentiated models of care supportive of community-based ARV provision by outreach workers. Home delivery models prioritized protection of client confidentiality and prevention measures for COVID-19. Sustainability of the innovation depends on reinforcement of the commodity management infrastructure and investment in financing mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Home delivery of ARVs is a feasible client-centered approach to be included among the options for decentralized drug distribution.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study in healthcare workers. SETTING: Northern Limburg, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: All employees of VieCuri Medical Center (n=3300) were invited to enrol in current study. In total 2507 healthcare workers participated. INTERVENTION: Between 22 June 2020 and 3 July 2020, participants provided venous blood samples voluntarily, which were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ig total ELISA test. Work characteristics, exposure risks and prior symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were gathered through a survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of healthcare workers with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 21.1% (n=530/2507). Healthcare workers between 17 and 30 years were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with participants >30 years. The probability of having SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was comparable for healthcare workers with and without direct patient (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.34) and COVID-19 patient contact (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.33).

In March 2020, Madrid became the city of the world with the highest incidence and mortality rates. By applying a phenomenological approach, this study aimed at gaining in-depth understanding of the subjective mental health experiences lived by Spanish young adults. METHODS: dialogical research was used to interact with AYA and young adults. AYA were recruited using the network of networks and snowball strategies. 36 were initially contacted and 35 decided to participate. All participants were informed of their right to stop the dialogue at any time without providing any further explanation to the researcher, and were informed of the data protection rules of the University of Copenhagen. All signed an informed consent. The 35 dialogues were held online using Zoom, recorded and saved in a secured folder.. The dialogues lasted on average 55 minutes, were transcribed with Nvivo Transcription software. The sociological theory on Resonance was used to shape specific segments of the dialogues and to analysis the data. RESULTS: 35 online dialogues with 20 adolescent girls and 15 adolescent boys aged from 17 to 23 were held from the second to the 28 of April 2020. The majority of youth did not leave their residences for 2 months. Three of them lost relatives due to COVID-19, one was admitted at the hospital and seven had relatives who contracted the disease. Different themes were brought up: 1) AYA' relations with their physical spaces and with time. 2) Relating with others. 3) Strategies to overcome sense of alienation, loss and fear and to re-find resonance. AYA living with chronic or mental diseases realized the importance of developing supportive habits and of adhering to treatments.

These two dimensions of demands and resources thus counterbalance each other and define the level of work commitment and finally its consequences in terms of performance. In the context of telework, which was the rule during the period of containment due to the COVID crisis, our qualitative field survey (involving more than 80 people) revealed numerous human risks such as demotivation, difficulties in resting on clear work instructions or a loss of meaning at middle management level had a direct effect on human reliability (Dhillon, 2013) and generally on work engagement. The problem is that the risk of a decline in work commitment is not something visible to the organization. We therefore propose to combine the JD-R model with the Bow-Tie method (Khakzad et al., 2012).

We hypothesized that both FHA and PRN would serve critical roles in the adhesion process and be necessary for colonization of the swine respiratory tract. To investigate the role of FHA and PRN in Bordetella pathogenesis in swine, we constructed mutants containing an in-frame deletion of the FHA or the PRN structural gene in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate. Both mutants were compared to the wild-type swine isolate for their ability to colonize and cause disease in swine. Colonization of the FHA mutant was lower than that of the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, the PRN mutant caused similar disease severity relative to the wild type; however, colonization of the PRN mutant was reduced relative to the wild type during early and late infection and induced higher anti-Bordetella antibody titers.

We evaluated the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in RMD patients and heathy subjects who received anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: We performed a telephone interview collecting any adverse event (AE) following immunization (AEFI) that occurred in RMD patients and healthy controls after the two doses of mRNA vaccine including common local reactogenicity and systemic events (for example, fever, fatigue/malaise, joint and muscle pain). We also investigated the onset of new signs or symptoms of the RMD after the vaccination. RESULTS: We evaluated 126 patients with RMDs [105 females and 19 males, median age 51(IQR 17)] and 85 controls [62 females and 23 males, (median age 49 (20)]. Seventy patients (55.6%) were taking immunosuppressants, conventional synthetic (n=31, 43.3%) and/or biological [TNF inhibitors (n=49, 68.6%)], and 30 (23.8%) were taking hydroxychloroquine; treatment remained unchanged in 77% of patients. Eleven out of 126 patients and none of the 85 controls previously contracted COVID-19. The median follow-up from the completion of vaccination was 15 (3) weeks both in patients and controls. We reviewed 5 suspected cases confirming mild articular flares in 3 women (2.8) with inflammatory arthritis (2 psoriatic arthritis and 1 rheumatoid arthritis) while no disease reactivation was recorded in patients with connective tissue diseases; the incidence rate of RMD reactivation was 0.007 person/month. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed similar frequencies of local and systemic AEFI in patients and controls with no effect of therapies or previous COVID-19. Local reactionpain in the injection sitewas the most frequently reported AEFI both in RMD and controls (71% and 75% of all the AEFI, respectively) after the first dose. Overall, up to 66% of patients experienced at least one AEFI at the second dose and up to 62% in the control group. Most of AEFI occurred within 2 days of vaccine administration. Two RMD patients developed pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 after the first dose of vaccine. CONCLUSION: The low incidence rate of disease reactivation and the similar AEFI occurrence compared to controls should reassure on mRNA vaccine safety in RMD patients.

Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2. CONCLUSION: Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression (infection rate and death) exponentially.

Using a quantitative risk assessment model, this study characterized the impact of risk reduction strategies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission (droplet, aerosol, fomite-mediated) among front-line workers in a representative indoor fresh fruit and vegetable manufacturing facility. We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1C3 m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8 h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene, vaccination). Without mitigation measures, the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was largest for close contact (droplet and aerosol) at 1 m (0.96, 5th C 95th percentile: 0.67C1.0). In comparison, risk associated with fomite (0.26, 5th C 95th percentile: 0.10C0.56) or aerosol exposure alone (0.05, 5th C 95th percentile: 0.01C0.13) at 1 m distance was substantially lower (73C95%). At 1 m, droplet transmission predominated over aerosol and fomite-mediated transmission, however, this changed by 3 m, with aerosols comprising the majority of the exposure dose. Increasing physical distancing reduced risk by 84% (1C2 m) and 91% (1C3 m). Universal mask use reduced infection risk by 52C88%, depending on mask type. Increasing ventilation (from 0.1 to 2C8 air changes/hour) resulted in risk reductions of 14C54% (1 m) and 55C85% (2 m). Combining these strategies, together with handwashing and surface disinfection, resulted in <1% infection risk. Partial or full vaccination of the susceptible worker resulted in risk reductions of 73C92% (1 m risk range: 0.08C0.26). However, vaccination paired with other interventions (ACH 2, mask use, or distancing) was necessary to achieve infection risks <1%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey, containing closed-ended questions, was distributed among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists, technicians, and nurses. It consisted of questions assessing socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, in addition to questions from the modified PMT that has been tailored for the COVID-19 pandemic through five sub-constructs: perceived severity and perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy, response costs, and behavioral intention. RESULTS: A total of 385 HCPs have participated in the study with a mean age of 40.088.2 years; the majority was Saudi, married, and having children. There was a significant association between intention to comply with COVID-19 preventive behavior and being females, nurses, having training in Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) during work time (p0.01). Other demographic variables, working experience, the status of being in the workforce during the pandemic COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia did not have a significant effect on the intention of HCPs to comply with COVID-19 preventive behavior. The vast majority 85.7% of HCPs answered always regarding the behavioral intention of HCPs to comply with COVID-19 preventive behavior. There was a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 behavioral intention and other constructs of PMT model, including perceived severity (r=0.272) perceived vulnerability (r= 0.248), self-efficacy (r=0.218), response-efficacy (r=0.167), and response-cost (r=0.13). Gender, availability of PPE, and self-efficacy had a significant prediction of COVID-19 behavioral intentions (P <0.05) with a predicted increase of 0.56, 0.37, and 0.12, respectively, in the mean of the intention score. Self-efficacy was the highest significant predictor of the behavior (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: Females gender, nurses, having training in IPC measures, and availability of PPE during work time have a significant association with intention to comply with COVID-19 preventive behavior. The present study coping appraisal particularly self-efficacy predicted the COVID-19 pandemic protection motivation and preventive behavior more than threat appraisal. Therefore, future training programs must consider the level of self-efficacy of HCPS, and increase their knowledge regarding the effectiveness of recommendation strategies to perform protective measures against the COVID-19.","output":"Preventive Behaviors Towards Covid-19 Pandemic Among Healthcare Providers in Saudi Arabia Using the Protection Motivation Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oblivious RAM (ORAM), first introduced in the ground-breaking work of Goldreich and Ostrovsky (STOC 87 and J.

To compile a general program to an oblivious counterpart, it is well-known that [Formula: see text] amortized blowup is necessary, where N is the size of the logical memory. This was shown in Goldreich and Ostrovksys original ORAM work for statistical security and in a somewhat restricted model (the so called balls-and-bins model), and recently by Larsen and Nielsen (CRYPTO 18) for computational security.

Responsive behaviours are not only a sign of underlying unmet needs, but when directed against (towards) paid staff can lead to decreased quality of work life, and may contribute to lower quality of care. In this systematic review, we aim to synthesise empirically based quantitative and qualitative evidence on factors and stakeholder (eg, staff and family members) experiences of factors associated with the responsive behaviours of people living in LTC directed towards staff. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be a systematic review of published and 'grey' literature. Twelve bibliographical databases will be searched, and for each database, we will use appropriate subject headings and keywords that cover two concepts: LTC and responsive behaviour. No publication date or language filter will be used. The title and abstract of each extracted record will be screened, followed by screening of full text of included papers. Then data extraction and quality assessments will be undertaken. Each stage will be completed independently by pairs of authors. For quantitative studies, meta-analysis will be conducted if pooling is possible; otherwise, a critical narrative analysis will be conducted. For qualitative studies, thematic analysis will be conducted. Factors will then be organised at the individual, interpersonal, institutional and larger societal levels. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore the influence of risk of bias and publication bias on the results. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for people who live with dementia and those who do not. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review.

The effects on health-care utilization and disease activity were studied. METHODS: Using hospital data of patients with RA between 2014 and 2019, the use of an eHealth platform and participation in a self-management outpatient clinic were studied. An interrupted time series analysis compared the period before and after the introduction of the eHealth platform. The change in trend (relative to the pre-interruption trend) for the number of outpatient clinic visits and the DAS for 28 joints (DAS28) were determined for several scenarios. RESULTS: After implementation of the platform in April 2017, the percentage of patients using it was stable at 37%. On average, the users of the platform were younger, more highly educated and had better health outcomes than the total RA population. After implementation of the platform, the mean number of quarterly outpatient clinic visits per patient decreased by 0.027 per quarter (95% CI: ?0.045, ?0.08, P = 0.007). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in DAS28 of 0.056 per quarter (95% CI: ?0.086, ?0025, P = 0.001). On average, this resulted in 0.955 fewer visits per patient per year and a reduction of 0.503 in the DAS28. CONCLUSION: The implementation of remote patient monitoring has a positive effect on health-care utilization, while maintaining low disease activity.

Alveolar macrophage-derived cytokines contribute to the inflammation underlying pulmonary disease in COVID-19. We sought to determine if basal macrophage activation, as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, was present in PCOS and, if so, was further enhanced by vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 99 PCOS and 68 control women who presented sequentially. Plasma levels of a macrophage-derived cytokine panel were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Vitamin D was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: Vitamin D was lower in PCOS women (p<0.0001) and correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS (r=0.28, p=0.0046). Basal macrophage activation markers CXCL5, CD163 and MMP9 were elevated, whilst protective CD200 was decreased (p<0.05); changes in these variables were related to, and fully accounted for, by BMI. PCOS and control women were then stratified according to vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased CD80 and IFN- in PCOS and IL-12 in both groups (p<0.05). These factors, important in initiating and maintaining the immune response, were again accounted for by BMI. CONCLUSION: Basal macrophage activation was higher in PCOS with macrophage changes related with increased infection risk associating with vitamin D; all changes were BMI dependent, suggesting that obese PCOS with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk of more severe COVID-19 infection, but that it is obesity-related rather than an independent PCOS factor.","output":"Vitamin D Association With Macrophage-Derived Cytokines in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: An Enhanced Risk of COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The dermatology workforce is an important topic, as many countries are facing an undersupply of dermatologists, while some are expecting a surplus. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify the current dermatology workforce demographics in Saudi Arabia (SA) and the changes in such demographics over the last 10 years to identify future workforce-related challenges. METHODS: This study was conducted in SA, and it included all the practicing dermatologists in the country over the last decade (2010C2020). The number of practicing dermatologists, their gender, their nationality, and dermatology residency candidates and graduates were obtained from the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS). The geographic distribution of dermatologists was obtained from the Ministry of Health Statistical Yearbook 2018. RESULTS: As of September 2020, there were 2678 practicing dermatologists in SA at a ratio of 7.82 dermatologists per 100 000 people. Of the 2678 dermatologists, only 24.8% were Saudis. The Saudi dermatologist ratio has been almost constant over 10 years, ranging from 1.3 to 1.9 per 100 000 people. Of all Saudi dermatologists, 42% were female.

METHODS: Pre- (Sept. 2019 C Feb. 2020) and during- (Oct. 2020 C March 2021) COVID-19 physical activity and sedentary behavior data were collected for school-age children (8C11 years) enrolled in the Safe Travel Environment Evaluation in Texas Schools (STREETS) cohort study. Daily time spent in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time were assessed using GT3X-wBT Actigraph accelerometers. Parent surveys were used to assess socio-ecological factors. Latent class linear mixed models were used to identify change trajectories of MVPA and sedentary time. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between socio-ecological characteristics with physical activity and sedentary time change trajectory groups. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in mean daily MVPA (? 9.4 mins, SD = 18.54) and an increase in sedentary behavior (0.83 hrs, SD = 1.18). Two trajectory groups were identified for MVPA (decrease MPVA and maintain high MVPA), with the majority (82.1%) being in the decrease MVPA group. Three trajectory groups were identified for sedentary behavior (moderate increase sedentary, steep increase sedentary, and decrease sedentary), with most children (78.5%) being in the moderate increase group. Girls had significantly lower odds of being in the maintain high MVPA group than boys (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.11, 0.61). Children living in neighborhoods with higher perceived social cohesion had significantly higher odds of being in the maintain high MVPA group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.41), while those in neighborhoods with higher social cohesion had lower odds of being in the decrease sedentary group (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.99).

Methods Adults with COVID-19 were enrolled at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States (Figure 1). Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes (MeMed Key?). A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Description of derivation cohort RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results Between March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. Age ranged between 19-98 (median 61.5), with 59.1% male. Patients meeting severe outcomes exhibited higher levels of CRP and IP-10 and lower levels of TRAIL (Figure 2;p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signatures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and was superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77;p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78;p < 0.001). Clinical deterioration proximal to blood draw was associated with higher signature score. Scores of patients meeting a first outcome over 3 days after blood draw were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than scores of non-severe patients (Figure 3). Moreover, the signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001;Figure 4). TRAIL, IP-10, CRP and the severity signature score are differentially expressed in severe and non-severe COVID-19 infection Dots represent patients and boxes denote median and interquartile range (IQR) The signature score of patients meeting a severe outcome on or after the day of blood draw is significantly (p < 0.001) higher than the signature score of non-severe patients.

Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne disease in Poland. The onset of tick exposure in early spring 2020 coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in the Lublin Province and in individual counties of the area in the year preceding the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland and in the first year of its duration (2019-2020). Material and methods. Epidemiological analysis was performed on the basis of data from the National Institute of Public Health - National Research Institute and data from the Regional SanitaryEpidemiological Station in Lublin. Results. In 2020, the incidence rate of Lyme borreliosis in the Lublin Province was registered to decrease more than 2 times compared to 2019 (from 87.4/100,000 to 37.4/100,000). Decreases in the number of recorded cases were observed in all quarters of 2020. The largest, more than 5-fold decrease in the number of recorded cases was seen in Q4 (523 cases in 2019, 101 cases in 2020). The largest numerical decrease of the incidence rate was registered in Wlodawa County (-158.12/100,000), Biala Podlaska County (-143.43), Krasnik County (-122.20) and the city of Biala Podlaska (-83.92). On the other hand, the largest percentage decrease of the rate was noted in Lublin County (-92%), Biala Podlaska County (-91%), Ryki County (-90%) and the city of Biala Podlaska (-89%). Conclusions. Significant decreases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis observed in 2020 in the Lublin Province are undoubtedly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and difficulties in accessing medical care for patients with ailments other than those resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Local healthcare providers should be alert to the possibility that more patients than ever before are presenting with a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, late manifestations of the disease.","output":"Lyme Borreliosis in the Lublin Province during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) with pneumonia is associated with high rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

All the patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of Tenon University-teaching hospital, from February 22 to May 7th, 2020 were included. Respiratory tract specimens were obtained within the first 48 h of ICU admission. During the study period, 101 patients were referred to the ICU for COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Most patients (n = 83; 82.2%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated on ICU admission. Overall, 20 (19.8%) respiratory tract specimens obtained within the first 48 h. Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen identified, accounting for almost half of the early-onset bacterial etiologies. We found a high prevalence of early-onset bacterial coinfection during severe COVID-19 pneumonia, with a high proportion of S. aureus.

ACE2 is also the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on the claim that RAS inhibitors (RASIs) cause ACE2 overexpression in some animal experiments, concerns have arisen that RASIs may aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease-2019 severity in RASI-treated patients. To achieve a comprehensive review, a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted regarding the effects of RASIs on tissue ACE2 mRNA/protein expression in healthy animals and animal models of human diseases. We identified 88 eligible articles involving 168 experiments in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Three of 38 experiments involving healthy animals showed ACE2 expression greater than twice that of the control (overexpression). Among 102 disease models (130 experiments), baseline ACE2 was overexpressed in 16 models (18 experiments) and less than half the control level (repression) in 28 models (40 experiments). In 72 experiments, RASIs did not change ACE2 levels from the baseline levels of disease models. RASIs caused ACE2 overexpression compared to control levels in seven experiments, some of which were unsupported by other experiments under similar conditions. In 36 experiments, RASIs reversed or prevented disease-induced ACE2 repression, yielding no or marginal changes. Therefore, ACE2 overexpression appears to be a rare rather than common consequence of RASI treatment in healthy animals and disease models. Future studies should clarify the pathophysiological significance of RASI-induced reversal or prevention of ACE2 repression in disease models.","output":"Overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social norms C estimates of peers behavior and attitudes C are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. METHOD: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers vaccination behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine.

Studies have shown that the average number of working hours per week is a significant predictor of stress and that the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the nurses stress levels. Objective: Therefore, we investigated (1) if a change had occurred in the nurses working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the hours employed and (2) the influence of the nursing staffs working hours during COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived level of stress. Design: We used an online survey in this Austrian cross-sectional study, distributed using a snowball sampling method. Participants and methods: In the online survey, we asked the nurses many relevant questions, including how many hours they are employed per week and how many hours they had worked on average per week since the outbreak of COVID-19. We used the Perceived Stress scale to measure stress level among these nurses. Data were collected between mid-May and mid-July 2020. Results: Three-quarters of the 2600 participating nurses reported changes in their working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nursing staffs hours of employment were statistically significantly associated with their average number of working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. About two-thirds of the nurses who were employed either less than 10 hours or for 31-40 hours worked for more than 40 hours. Most of the nurses experienced a moderate level of stress. We identified a statistically significant association between increasing the number of working hours per week and the nurses perceived stress level. In addition, 15% of the nurses who had worked more than 40 hours reported experiencing a high level of stress. In addition, we found that nurses who worked more hours during the pandemic experienced higher stress than nurses who reduced their working hours or kept the same working hours. Conclusions: We found a statistically significant association between an increase in the nursing staffs working hours and their level of stress. We believe that these results reflect the negative consequences of prolonged working hours.

RESULTS 119 U.S. otolaryngology residents representing 27 of 42 states with otolaryngology residency programs responded to the survey. 24.4% (95% CI 17.0-31.8%) self-reported some level of burnout, while 10.9% met SMBM criteria for \\"clinically relevant\\" burnout. 51.3% experienced more stress, and 58.8% reported more anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to males, females had a higher prevalence of burnout (38.9% vs 12.3%, P = .001) and anxiety (75.9% vs 43.8%, P < .001). PGY-2s had a greater mean SMBM index (3.64) and higher rates of self-reported burnout (54.2%) than their counterparts at other levels of training.

We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both Mpro and PLpro proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the Mpro protease and no viable hits for the PLpro protease. Of the Mpro hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead Mpro inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of Mpro inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsins L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2.

It also describes a few pertinent drug delivery mechanisms such as nanoparticles, liposomes, coformulation, recombinant human hyaluronidase for subcutaneous delivery, pulmonary delivery, and 3D printing. In addition, it provides an overview of the current CMC regulatory challenges and discusses potential methods of accelerating regulatory mechanisms for more efficient approvals. Finally, we look at the future of biotherapeutics and emphasize the need to bring these modalities to the forefront of patient care from a global perspective as effectively as possible.","output":"The Confluence of Innovation in Therapeutics and Regulation: Recent CMC Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive WHO standards-based tool to measure women's perceived quality of maternal and newborn care (QMNC) in health facilities is needed to allow for comparisons of data across settings and over time. This paper describes the development of such a tool, and its validation in Italy. DESIGN: A multiphase, mixed-methods study involving qualitative and quantitative research methods. SETTING: Nine health facilities in Italy. METHODS: The questionnaire was developed in six phases: (1) Defining the scope, characteristics and a potential list of measures for the tool; (2) initial content and construct validation; (3) first field testing to assess acceptability and perceived utility for end-users (1244 women, 35 decision makers) and further explore construct validity; (4) content optimisation and score development; (5) assessment of face validity, intrarater reliability and internal consistency and (6) second field testing in nine maternity hospitals (4295 women, 78 decision-makers). RESULTS: The final version of the tool included 116 questions accounting for 99 out of the 350 of the extended lists of WHO Quality Measures. Observed face validity was very good, with 100% agreement for 101 (87%) questions and Kappa exceeding 0.60 for remaining ones. Reliability was good, with either high agreement or Kappa exceeding 0.60 for all items. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.84 to 0.88, indicating very good internal consistency. Acceptability across seven hospitals was good (mean response rate: 57.4%, 95% CI 44.4% to 70.5%). The questionnaire proved to be useful, driving the development of actions plan to improve the QMNC in each facility. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that the tool has good content, construct, face validity, intrarater reliability and internal consistency, while being acceptable and useful. Therefore, it could be used in health facilities in Italy and similar context. More research should investigate how effectively use the tool in different countries for improving the QMNC.","output":"WHO standards-based tool to measure women's views on the quality of care around the time of childbirth at facility level in the WHO European region: development and validation in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to our National Health Service (NHS) (1).

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). An electronic-based survey was conducted between 29 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from the health, scientific and humanities schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. The total number of participants was 1540 students. The mean age of study participants was 22 years and females predominated the study population (n = 1145, 74.4%). The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n = 1079, 70.1%). Males, Jordanians and participants with lower income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous. A lower level of knowledge and a higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a conspiracy. Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy. Belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of a vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment. The Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n = 1018). The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of a lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to a higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.","output":"Conspiracy Beliefs Are Associated with Lower Knowledge and Higher Anxiety Levels Regarding COVID-19 among Students at the University of Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oligonucleotide-based therapies are advanced novel interventions used in the management of various respiratory diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

The aim of the present study was to assess the changes in compliance with the protective behavioral recommendations after taking the first round of COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers in Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used in which quantitative data were collected using a survey method. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a sample of healthcare workers who were selected through a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. From the 403 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 236 properly completed and returned the questionnaires. After inserting it into SPSS software, data were analyzed using frequency tables, percentage distributions, and logistic regression coefficients. RESULTS: While 30.5% of the healthcare workers disclosed a decreasing experience of wearing mask, 30.1% revealed that their experience of regularly washing hands has decreased after taking the first round of COVID-19 vaccine. The main reasons for not regularly wearing a mask are its inconvenience (60%), the need to appear indifferent (38.5%), and that they cannot afford to buy one due to its cost (15.4%). Above all, respondents level of compliance with regular wearing of a mask is significantly associated with sex (OR = 3.165, P<0.05; 95% CI: 1.186C8.448), the type of organization in which they are currently working (OR = 3.553, P<0.05; 95% CI: 1.185C10.647), knowing someone ever infected by COVID-19 (OR = 0.091, P<0.001; 95% CI: 0.030C0.275), and the belief that COVID-19 causes a severe illness (OR = 0.249, P<0.05; 95% CI: 0.299C2.615).

Therefore, increased access to the personal protective materials, including water, should be created and the healthcare workers should be continuously informed about the serious consequences of ignorance of self-protective behavior.","output":"Changing Patterns of Compliance with Protective Behavioral Recommendations in the Post First-Round COVID-19 Vaccine Period Among Healthcare Workers in Southern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is an analysis of the presence of self-selection mechanisms on the market that could bring the market closer to the separating equilibrium state, in line with the RothschildCStiglitz equilibrium model and its subsequent modifications. An example is the Polish market of compulsory third-party liability insurance of vehicle owners. This paper describes this market in terms of both its structure and its financial results. The main focus is on describing the assumptions of the RothschildCStiglitz model for markets operating under the conditions of information asymmetry and based on the self-selection mechanism, allowing for an unequivocal determination of the insureds profile without the need to actually observe the insureds behaviour. Finally, we show that thanks to the self-selection induced by the possibility of driving behaviour monitoring, the industry can minimise the negative effect information asymmetry has on the motor insurance market. This can be achieved, for example, by observing the choices made by the insured after being offered a new voluntary contract with a premium based on telematics data. Our analysis was carried out with the use of three selected characteristics that can determine the insureds risk profile, i.e., distance covered, self-assessment, and insurance premium paid;the significance of the latteralthough it may be intuitiveis questionable at commonly accepted significance levels. Therefore, the main result is that although there is some evidence on the disputed matter, there can be no definitive conclusionespecially in terms of risk as measured by insurance premium.","output":"Risk Self-Selection and the Concept of Equilibrium in a Competitive Insurance Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied South Asian immigrant patients who did not return to Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC) after emergent cardiac catheterization in order to propose interventions to improve follow up care.

Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic risk factors may also vary by age. This study aimed to determine the association between common patient characteristics and mortality across age-groups among COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database between April C June 2020. Inpatients were identified using COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. A priori-defined exposures were sex and present-on-admission hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and interactions between age and these comorbidities. Controlling for additional confounders, we evaluated relationships between these variables and in-hospital mortality in a log-binomial model. RESULTS: Among 66,646 (6.5%) admissions with a COVID-19 diagnosis, across 613 U.S. hospitals, 12,388 (18.6%) died in-hospital. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with 30% higher mortality risk (aRR, 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26 C 1.34). Diabetes without chronic complications was not a risk factor at any age (aRR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96 C 1.06), and hypertension without chronic complications was only a risk factor in 20-39 year-olds (aRR, 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17 C 2.40).

Understanding the arrival rates of patients to the emergency department (ED) is fundamental in managing the limited health care resources. Our objective is to develop an accurate forecasting model based on ED patients arrival and COVID-19 status to help manage and facilitate a data-driven resource planning. Methods: A cohort study of patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 evaluated at 2 EDs within an integrated health system that cares for a racially diverse population. We included patient arrivals, COVID-19 status, and demographic information between the dates of January 1, 2020 and March 16, 2021. We developed deep learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) to forecast patient arrivals in two geographically diverse EDs (denoted as ED1 and ED2). We used data from January to December 2020 for model training and data from January 2021 to March 2021 for model validation. The models are evaluated based on the root mean squared error (RMSE), the square root of the average of the squared error between predicted and observed values, and the mean absolute error (MAE), which provides the mean absolute difference between the predicted and the observed ED patient arrival rates per day. Results: In ED1, there were 56, 61 total patient arrivals (1, 433 infected COVID-19 patients) with a mean age of 38.0  21.2 years. A majority were female (33, 457, 59.1%) and 29, 040 (51.3%) were Black. The average patient arrival per day was 125.1 (SD 35.0) for those without COVID-19, and 3.3 (SD 3.6) for COVID-1 confirmed patients. In ED2, there were 74, 176 total patient arrivals (1, 546 infected COVID-19 patients) with a mean age of 45.0  23.0 years. A majority were female (39, 521, 53.3%) and 10, 636 (14.3%) were Black. The average patient arrival per day was 164.7 (SD 33.2) for those without COVID-19, and 3.5 (SD 5.0) for COVID 19 confirmed patients. Figure 1 shows the observed and predicted patients arrival for the two EDs for regular and confirmed COVID-19 patients. The LSTM models show accurate prediction one week in advance of daily patient arrivals for ED1 and ED2 with RMSE scores of 17 and 20 patients, respectively. The MAE values imply that, on average, the forecasts error from the true daily patient arrival rate is 13.9 and 16.0 for ED1 and ED2, respectively. For COVID-19 patient arrivals to ED1 and ED2, the RMSE score is 3 patients each, while th MAE values are 2.2 and 2.4, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that an average RMSE prediction score of 18.5 and 3 patient arrivals per day for regular and COVID-19 confirmed patients is possible across EDs using LSTM one week prior to forecasting. Future validation and implementation of such forecasting models could impact effective planning and allocation of limited ED and hospital resources.

At the electroneurographic examination, the motor nerves conduction study was normal. Median, ulnar, and sural nerves sensory compound nerve action potential (CNAP) were bilaterally absent. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were not recordable. Spine MRI demonstrated roots enhancement from C3 to Th2 and diffuse enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots. She was treated with IV methylprednisolone whit benefit. A follow-up visit was made 4 months after the disease onset; a diagnosis of pure sensitive CIAP has been made. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of CIAP occurring in a close temporal relationship with the administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Pure sensitive chronic inflammatory axonal polyneuropathy following Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With high certainty, extreme weather events will intensify in their impact within the next 10 years due to climate change-induced increases in hazard probability of occurrence and simultaneous increases in socio-economic vulnerability Data from previous mega-disasters show that losses from disruptions of critical services surpass the value of direct damages in the exposed areas because critical infrastructures [CI] are increasingly (inter-) dependent Local events may have global impacts Systemic criticality, which describes the relevance of a critical infrastructure due to its positioning within the system, needs to be addressed to reduce the likelihood of cascading effects This paper presents novel approaches to operationalise and assess systemic criticality Firstly, the paper introduces systemic cascade potential as a measurement of systemic criticality It takes the relevance of a sector and the relevance of its interdependencies into account to generate a relative value of systemic importance for a CI sector Secondly, an exemplary sectoral assessment of the road network allows reflecting the spatial manifestation of the first level of cascading effects It analyses the impact of traffic interruptions on the accessibility of critical facilities to point out the systemically most critical segments of the municipal road network To further operationalise the spatial dimension of criticality, a normative assertion determining the worthiness of protection of system components is required A nationwide spatial flood protection plan incorporates this aspect in Germany for the first time Its formal approval process was initiated in February 2020","output":"Systemic criticalitya new assessment concept improving the evidence basis for CI protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the negative effects of wearing a mouth-nose cover (MNC) on interpersonal functioning have been discussed in public media but empirical studies on how wearing MNCs affect social judgements are sparse. In the present study, we investigated the effects of MNCs on trustworthiness appraisals, the influence of changes due to MNCs in evaluating joy, and the relationship between a social-cognitive appraisal bias and a participant's characteristics. METHODS: All participants (N = 165) judged the intensity of happiness and trustworthiness in calm facial stimuli presented with and without a surgical mask covering part of the face. We analysed the relationship of changes in judgements evoked by MNCs to participants' evaluations of MNCs as protective tools and explored their associations with the burden experienced by wearing MNCs, compliance to behaviour recommendations, their risk associated with the pandemic, and their levels of psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, calm facial stimuli covered with MNCs were evaluated as less trustworthy and, to an even stronger extent, less happy than uncovered facial stimuli. However, participants varied in whether they showed a negative or positive evaluation of faces with MNCs; the negative bias was stronger in those participants who attributed lower protective potential to MNCs, experienced a higher burden while wearing MNCs, wore MNCs less often, and experienced a higher level of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: A negative bias in trustworthiness appraisals of faces with a positive emotional expression covered by MNCs is linked to a participant's evaluation of MNCs as inefficient and burdening and their experience of high psychological distress.","output":"Trustworthiness appraisals of faces wearing a surgical mask during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany: An experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Heavy metal ions in contaminated water, such as hexavalent chromium, are harmful to humans. Bacterial biosorption is an ideal method for the treatment of hexavalent chromium. However, hexavalent chromium in solution causes bacteria to produce reactive oxygen species, which leads to bacterial death and affects biosorption. We developed a microfluidics-based biomimetic mineralization method to encapsulate bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) with zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), thus allowing the bacteria to form a continuous and homogeneous shell. The artificial shells endowed bacteria with the ability to tolerate harsh environments, which was significant during the treatment of contaminated water. The adsorption of hexavalent chromium was a two-step process: first the fast physical adsorption of ZIF-8 and biosorption by bacteria (up to 30C50% adsorption in 1 day), followed by secondary biosorption after decomposition of the system. The maximum adsorption of hexavalent chromium by the encapsulated bacteria reached 90%. The microfluidic device developed in this study provides a simple method to encapsulate bacteria mildly and enable cell survival in extreme environments, offering the possibility of future microbial applications in environmental and other fields.","output":"Killing Two Birds with One Stone: Biomineralized Bacteria Tolerate Adverse Environments and Absorb Hexavalent Chromium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections with SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, but they can also be accompanied by a variety of symptoms that result in mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and are sometimes associated with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses. To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was neither infected nor did it show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types were damaged, and the barrier function was deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear. In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokines or components induced during infection, which further results in the damage of the epithelial/endothelial barrier function and viral dissemination.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 challenges healthcare systems and societies worldwide in unprecedented ways. Although numerous new studies have been conducted, research to better understand the molecular pathogen-host interactions are urgently needed. For this, experimental models have to be developed and adapted. In the present study we used mono cell-culture systems and we established a complex chip model, where epithelial and endothelial cells are cultured in close proximity. We demonstrate that epithelial cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while the endothelium did not show any infection signs. Since SARS-CoV-2 is able to establish viremia, the link to thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 courses is evident. However, whether the endothelial layer is damaged by the viral pathogens or whether other endothelial-independent homeostatic factors are induced by the virus is essential for understanding the disease development. Therefore, our study is important as it demonstrates that the endothelial layer could not be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our in vitro experiments, but we were able to show the destruction of the epithelial-endothelial barrier in our chip model. From our experiments we can assume that virus-induced host factors disturbed the epithelial-endothelial barrier function and thereby promote viral spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 causes severe epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has affected the psychological health of older adults directly and indirectly through recommendations of social distancing and isolation.

We have shown previously that the N-terminal domain of S. aureus extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) binds to P-selectin and interferes with platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation. Here, we aimed to identify the minimal Efb motif required for binding platelets and to characterise its ability to interfering with the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates. METHODS AND RESULTS Using a library of synthetic peptides, we mapped the platelet-binding site to a continuous 20 amino acid stretch. The peptide Efb68-87 was able to bind to resting and, to a greater extent, thrombin-stimulated platelets in the absence of fibrinogen. Dot blots, pull-down assays and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) competitive binding experiments identified P-selectin as the cellular docking site mediating Efb68-87 platelet binding. Accordingly, Efb68-87 did not bind to other blood cells and captured platelets from human whole blood under low shear stress conditions. Efb68-87 did not affect platelet activation as tested by aggregometry, flow cytometry and immunoblotting, but inhibited the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs). Efb68-87 also interfered with the platelet-dependent stimulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS We have identified Efb68-87 as a novel selective platelet-binding peptide. Efb68-87 binds directly to P-selectin and inhibits interactions of platelets with leukocytes that lead to PLA and NET formation. As PLAs and NETs play a key role in thromboinflammation, Efb68-87 is an exciting candidate for the development of novel selective inhibitors of the proinflammatory activity of platelets.","output":"A peptide from the staphylococcal protein Efb binds P-selectin and inhibits the interaction of platelets with leukocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The well-being of the world's 1.65 million seafarers is expected to be secured by the rights established under the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), 2006 with active monitoring of its implementation by the flag administrations through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and International Labour Organisation (ILO). However, the substantial gains achieved since entry into force of MLC in August 2013 appear to have been severely dented by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine, on a pilot basis, the disruptions and challenges to the observance of seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance as an immediate consequence of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS The impact of COVID-19 on seafarers' rights was examined in three dimensions - shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance. Questionnaires were administered online from June to August 2020 to 450 seafarers, top 10 ship-management companies, 35 shipping companies and maritime administrations of top 5 seafarer supplying countries. The paper discusses the results of the survey. RESULTS The research revealed a previously unknown majority preference for shore leave, that diminished sharply during COVID-19. Impact on work-performance and well-being of seafarers was revealed with only a fifth of the seafarers having willingly agreed to an extension of contract. This study revealed incidence rates at 6 months into the pandemic of several parameters - delayed repatriations (21.44%) that includes crew with contract extensions (12.48%), crew with completed contract awaiting repatriation (8.96%) and crew that had exceeded 12-month continuous service (0.82%). Compensation, if provided, is meagre and was affecting ratings the most. Deprivation of medical assistance was also revealed. CONCLUSIONS The well being of seafarers would likely remain vulnerable to breaches, unless measures are put in place to safeguard the rights assured under MLC in the face of uncertainties caused by a pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood triglyceride, free fatty acid and insulin levels are lower after acute intake of an oil-water-monoglyceride gel versus an oil-water mixture, demonstrating that food matrix nanostructure and microstructure can be engineered to modulate the physiological response.

We measured the seroprevalence of chikungunya, dengue and Zika and its associated factors in the population of Juazeiro do Norte, Southern Cear State, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of analytical and spatial analysis was performed to estimate the seroprevalence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya, in the year 2018. Participants were tested for IgM and IgG against these three viruses. Those with IgM and/or IgG positive tests results were considered positive. Poisson regression was used to analyze the factors associated with positive cases, in the same way that the spatial analysis of positive cases was performed to verify whether the cases were grouped. RESULTS: Of the 404 participants, 25.0% (103/404) were positive for CHIKV, 92.0% (373/404) for flavivirus (dengue or Zika) and of these, 37.9% (153/404) samples were classified as probable dengue infection.

The survey comprised questions concerning socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behavior towards COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to identify the risk factors depression and suicidal ideation. Geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis was used to identify district-wise susceptibility to depression and suicidal ideation. Findings: The prevalence rate of depression and suicidal ideation related to COVID-19 was 33% and 5%. Common risk factors for suicidal ideation and depression included being young, being female, being a cigarette smoker, having comorbid diseases, having high scores on the Fear COVID-19 Scale, and having insomnia symptoms.

Yet, efforts to treat ARDS patients with liquid instillations of exogenous surfactant have so far failed. One of the ongoing challenges in surfactant therapy is obtaining a homogeneous distribution of surfactant within the lungs despite an inherent tendency to non-uniform spreading, owing amongst others to the influence of gravity. Here, we show that liquid foam therapy (LiFT), where surfactant is foamed prior to intratracheal administration, may improve notably surfactant distribution while maintaining safety and efficacy. We first show quantitatively that a foamed surrogate surfactant solution distributes more uniformly in ex vivo pig lungs compared to endotracheal instillations of the liquid solution, while maintaining pulmonary airway pressures within a safe range. Next, we demonstrate that a foamed commercial surfactant preparation (Infasurf) is effective in an established in vivo rat lung lavage model of ARDS. Our results suggest that LiFT may be more effective than liquid instillations for treating ARDS and serve as a proof-of-principle towards large animal and clinical trials.","output":"Liquid foam therapy (LiFT) for homogenous distribution of exogenous pulmonary surfactant in ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperglycemia-caused podocyte injury plays a crucial role in the progress of diabetic kidney disease. Podoplanin, one of the podocyte-associated molecules, is closely related to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. A number of studies demonstrate that berberine could ameliorate renal dysfunction in diabetic mice with nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the relationship between the renoprotective effect of berberine and podoplanin expression in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice as well as mouse podocytes (MPC5 cells) cultured in high glucose (HG, 30 mM) medium. We found that the expression levels of podoplanin were significantly decreased both in the renal glomerulus of STZ-induced diabetic mice and HG-cultured MPC5 cells. We also demonstrated that NF-B signaling pathway was activated in MPC5 cells under HG condition, which downregulated the expression level of podoplanin, thus leading to increased podocyte apoptosis. Administration of berberine (100, 200 mg/kg every day, ig, for 8 weeks) significantly improved hyperglycemia and the renal function of STZ-induced diabetic mice and restored the expression level of podoplanin in renal glomerulus. In high glucose-cultured MPC5 cells, treatment with berberine (30C120 M) dose-dependently decreased the apoptosis rate, increased the expression of podoplanin, and inhibited the activation of NF-B signaling pathway. When podoplanin expression was silenced with shRNA, berberine treatment still inhibited the NF-B signaling pathway, but its antiapoptotic effect on podocytes almost disappeared. Our results suggest that berberine inhibits the activation of NF-B signaling pathway, thus increasing the podoplanin expression to exert renoprotective effects.","output":"Podoplanin mediates the renoprotective effect of berberine on diabetic kidney disease in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance experts are leveraging user-generated content on social media to track the spread and effects of COVID-19. However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents \\"used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus.\\" We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Digital Divides in Posting COVID-19 Content on Social Media Among US Adults: Secondary Survey Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A new treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), REGN-COV2, a cocktail consisting of two neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been approved for patients at a risk of developing more severe disease.

Despite substantial advancements in biotechnologies such as assays for detecting promising hits and computational methods for identifying targets to pursue, the success rate of novel therapeutics in the clinic is rapidly declining. The two most common reasons for drug attrition in clinical trials are efficacy, in that the drug is not capable of treating the disease, and safety, in which the compound is too toxic to patients and does not outweigh any purported benefits. Here we describe the use of an integrated human interactome network to describe the complete picture of drug behavior in biological systems and lead to more promising therapeutic candidate generation. The Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for shotgun multiscale drug discovery, repurposing, and design was enhanced to include drugs/compounds, proteins, diseases/indications, Gene Ontology entities, and drug side effects, accompanied with various known associations between them, and interactomic signatures were generated for all compounds using the node2vec algorithm for the purpose of relating them in the context of diseases for which they are approved. The results indicate there is significant biological information available in the side effect profile of a drug and they can be used to better relate drugs in terms of their therapeutic behavior. Side effects were also predicted for all compounds in the platform; known drug-side effect associations were recovered at rates ten times higher than what can be expected with random chance. The network architecture was also investigated in the context of protein pathways, where drug distance to various pathways served as the features for input to a random forest machine learning model in the context of indications they are associated to treat, with interesting results highlighted for mental disorders and cancer metastasis. This pipeline highlights the ability of CANDO to accurately relate drugs in a multitarget interactomic context, and paves the way for predicting novel putative drug candidates using the information gleaned from not only their side effect profiles, but their impacts on protein pathways as well. Significance Statement Our study outlines the capability of our drug discovery, repurposing, and design platform known as CANDO to more accurately describe small molecule therapeutic behavior in biological systems via the use of heterogeneous networks. This includes the ability to predict indications as well as side effects for compounds without clinical data, ultimately advancing the science of drug discovery.","output":"Effective holistic characterization of small molecule effects using heterogeneous biological networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures were put into place to flatten the pandemic curve. It was projected that older adults were at increased risk for poor psychological and health outcomes resulting from increased social isolation and loneliness. However, little research has supported this projection among community-dwelling older adults. While a growing body of research has examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults, there is a paucity of qualitative research that captures the lived experience of community-dwelling older adults in Canada. The current study aimed to better understand the lived experience of community-dwelling older adults during the first six months of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with independent-living older adults aged 65 years and older. A total of 22 interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Following a recursive process, two overarching themes were identified: perceived threat and challenges of the pandemic, and coping with the pandemic. Specifically, participants reflected on the threat of contracting the virus and challenges associated with living arrangements, social isolation, and financial insecurity. Participants shared their coping strategies to maintain health and wellbeing, including behavioral strategies, emotion-focused strategies, and social support.

The primary outcome was achievement of substantial clinical improvement defined as sustained, reduced inflammatory activity at perioperativeevaluation, i.e., only minimal-to-moderate secretion and induration and a reduction of fistula size of a magnitude that would make it possible to perform a lay-open or sphincter-sparring closure procedure. Secondary outcomes weresymptom improvement, adverse treatment events and fistula healing after the surgical procedure in those achieving the primary outcome. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included (18 high transsphincteric, 3complex low transsphincteric, 1 suprasphincteric fistula). Fistulas had been present for a median of 24 [interquartile range, IQR: 12-33] months. In total, 16 patients (73%) achieved the primary outcome of substantial clinical improvement. Median time from infliximab initiation to patients achieved the primary outcome was 11 [IQR: 8-22] months. Sixteen of the patients responding to infliximab received subsequent lay-open or sphincter-sparring closure procedure surgery. Of these, ten (63%) achieved fistula healing. No serious infectious complications to infliximab treatment were seen. One patient developed a new abscess. One patient developed psoriasis (pustolosispalmoplantaris).

Despite widespread vaccine coverage, it remains one of the least well-controlled vaccine-preventable diseases, with a recent resurgence even in highly vaccinated populations. Although the exact underlying reasons are still not clear, emerging evidence suggests that a key factor is the replacement of the whole-cell (wP) by the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine, which is less reactogenic but may induce suboptimal and waning immunity. Differences between vaccines are hypothesised to be cell-mediated, with polarisation of Th1/Th2/Th17 responses determined by the composition of the pertussis vaccine given in infancy. Moreover, aP vaccines elicit strong antibody responses but fail to protect against nasal colonisation and/or transmission, in animal models, thereby potentially leading to inadequate herd immunity. Our review summarises current knowledge on vaccine-induced cellular immune responses, based on mucosal and systemic data collected within experimental animal and human vaccine studies. In addition, we describe key factors that may influence cell-mediated immunity and how antigen-specific responses are measured quantitatively and qualitatively, at both cellular and molecular levels. Finally, we discuss how we can harness this emerging knowledge and novel tools to inform the design and testing of the next generation of improved infant pertussis vaccines.","output":"Vaccine-Induced Cellular Immunity against Bordetella pertussis: Harnessing Lessons from Animal and Human Studies to Improve Design and Testing of Novel Pertussis Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ebola virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids.

These were compared with averaged counts from 2015 to 2019. Results: Overall, 686,199 tests were performed. The timing of NPI implementation was associated with a sharp and sustained decline in influenza, where during the typical annual influenza season (weeks 23C40) no cases were detected from 163,296 tests compared with an average of 26.1% (11,844/45,396) of tests positive in 2015C2019.

The pandemic has impacted society at whole. It changed the ways students access public health information and communicate about health. Reliable and trustworthy information is needed for all students to tackle present and future disease outbreaks, societal crisis, and strengthen health resources. For example, people with higher health literacy are more likely to follow the behavioural recommendations and receive vaccination. In addition, they are more likely to be competent to deal with the overabundance of information and protect themselves from false information about COVID-19, supporting their national emergencies strategies by adhering to protective behaviour recommendations. However, not much is known about student\`s digital health literacy and their information needs. The COVID Health Literacy Network (COVID-HL) is an international research community of partners from more than 60 different countries from academia and NGOs, and was formed in March 2020 during the onset of the pandemic. COVID-HL seeks to understand digital health literacy concerning COVID-19 and its impact on health outcomes and inequalities, at a global level and in different population groups. Using shared data collection instruments based on a web-based survey, in the initial study COVID-HL members together have collected data from over 70,000 university students globally. This was the first global population-based survey on digital health literacy. The purpose of this workshop is to present and compare some of the country results of the COVID-HL survey. The workshop will comprise five presentation from Germany, Greece, Portugal, Finland, and Lebanon. The findings vary across countries, but generally students have sufficient levels of digital health literacy. In contrast, they have problems evaluating the reliability of online health information about COVID-19 and lack the ability to determine whether commercial interest is attached to messages. The findings will be used for knowledge transfer in order to bridge the know-do gap, deliver tailored, easy-to-understand and practical information and inform interventions. Insights will inspire both national needs and international challenges, providing strategies to combat the pandemic and inform future digital health research and policy. Each project will be given ample time to present their findings, which will be followed by Q&A and an open discussion with the audiences. This workshop offers a forum for researchers, practitioners and policymakers interested in digital health literacy, digital public health, and global cross-country surveys and methods. By dialogue and two-way communication, vivid interaction will be ensured, allow building synergies, and facilitate networking and capacity building.

This paper describes the control programmes within NI, the challenges relating them, as well as assessing their impact and effectiveness, taking into consideration the quality of data available and number of herds participating. With the NI agricultural industry experiencing increasing financial pressures and post Brexit changes, the necessity of working to maximise the performance of bovine disease control programmes at the individual farm level as well as at the regional level is increasingly important. The programmes described fall into two categories with two distinct aims. Two managed by Animal Health & Welfare NI (AHWNI), the BVD eradication and JD Dairy Control programmes seek to eradicate or control infection at the regional level. A further 5 programmes, covering BVD, JD, IBR, Leptospirosis and Neosporosis, are managed by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) and focus on facilitating eradication or control at the individual herd level. These latter programmes conform to the Cattle Health Certification Standards (UK) (CHeCS) which is a UK self-regulatory body set up to ensure consistency between different disease control schemes across herds. The largest of all the programmes described is the AHWNI BVD Eradication Programme which has led to significant reductions in infection incidence.

The rolling annual incidence of BVD virus positive calves has fallen by 56% since the start of the compulsory programme in 2016. This decrease has occurred largely through industry initiatives to deal with BVD positives, including the voluntary culling of persistently infected (PI) animals by herd owners, a voluntary abattoir ban on the slaughter of BVD virus (BVDv) positive animals, and the inclusion of retention of a BVDv positive animal as a non-conformance in the industry-run Farm Quality Assurance Scheme.","output":"The Northern Ireland Control Programmes for Infectious Cattle Diseases Not Regulated by the EU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportancePredictive models can help identify SARS-CoV-2 patients at greatest risk of post-COVID sequelae and direct them towards appropriate care.

Methods A retrospective review of 74 patients who underwent successful SPDP and met the study criteria was performed. Of these, 67 (90.5%) patients underwent SSVDP, of which 38 patients (21 open, 17 MIS) had adequate long-term post-operative follow-up imaging to determine vascular patency. Results Fifty-one patients underwent open SPDP, whereas 23 patients underwent minimally invasive SPDP, out of which 10 (43.5%) were laparoscopic and 13 (56.5%) were robotic. Patients who underwent MI-SPDP had significantly longer operative time (307.5 vs. 162.5 min, P = 0.001) but shorter hospital stay (5 vs. 7 days, P = 0.021) and lower median blood loss (100 vs. 200 cc, P = 0.046) compared to that of O-SPDP.

This was particularly with respect to partial occlusion of the splenic vein, and there was no significant difference between the complete splenic vein occlusion rates between the MIS group and open group (29.4% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.954). The operative time was statistically significantly longer in patients who underwent robotic surgery versus laparoscopic surgery (330 vs. 173 min, P = 0.008). Conclusion Adoption of MI-spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) is safe and feasible. MI-SPDP is associated with a shorter hospital stay, lower blood loss but longer operation time compared to O-SPDP. In the present study, MI-SSVDP was associated with poorer long-term splenic vein patency rates compared to O-SSVDP.","output":"Short- and long-term outcomes after minimally invasive versus open spleen-saving distal pancreatectomies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-invasive mechanical ventilation has been increasingly used to avoid or serve as an alternative to intubation.

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65  16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r(2) = 0.79C0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90C0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87C0.95) for the AI scores.

Previously we found that 22 miRNAs appeared to predict total- and partial-body irradiation (TBI and PBI, respectively) patterns and were suggestive of the percentage of the body exposed in a baboon model. Motivated by these results, we performed a similar analysis on the transcriptional level (mRNAs) using whole genome microarrays. From 17 irradiated baboons, blood samples were taken before, and at 1, 2, 7, 28 and 75-106 days postirradiation to an equivalent TBI dose of 2.5 or 5 Gy applied either to the total body or to different parts of the body such as the upper body (UBE) or left hemibody (LHB). We compared quantile normalized log2-transformed gene expression values with three exposure pattern comparisons, namely TBI vs. PBI, TBI vs. LHB and UBE vs. LHB using Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression analysis for receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) calculation. We found several hundred significantly (P < 0.05) and 2-fold deregulated mRNAs per exposure pattern comparison with a peak of 163-860 mRNAs at day 28. Lower numbers on day 2 (60 mRNAs) and day 7 (91-162 mRNAs) were observed, with the lowest number of deregulated mRNAs at day 75-106 (22-58 mRNAs). The 14 most promising mRNAs (e.g., LTF, DEFA3, OLFM4) appeared 10.1-46.2-fold upregulated and the exposure groups were completely or almost completely discriminated (ROC between 0.8-1.0). Several of the mRNA gene expression changes were significantly associated with the percentage of the body exposed. The numbers of overlapping genes used for diagnosis on consecutive days postirradiation were mostly 0 or less than 10. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that at each time point different biological processes predominated. Our results suggest mRNA changes over time may be used to retrospectively determine radiation exposure patterns as partial or total body. mRNA gene expression changes likely could be applied over a longer time frame (2-75 days postirradiation) than miRNA, but due to the transient gene expression changes a different set of candidate mRNAs appears to be required at each day after irradiation.","output":"Differentiating Total- or Partial-Body Irradiation in Baboons Using mRNA Expression Patterns: A Proof of Concept."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) databases provide rich, longitudinal data on interactions with healthcare providers and can be used to advance research into respiratory conditions.

Therefore, the prevalence of the SFTSV gene or antibody in cats is important for public health as well as veterinary medicine. Materials and Methods: Sera were collected from 201 feral and house cats in the ROK in 2017. Samples were analyzed for the presence of the SFTSV gene after RT-nested PCR amplification and for anti-SFTSV antibodies after enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Developed by ACEP, CEDR is the first Emergency Medicine (EM) specialty-wide registry to measure acute care quality, outcomes, practice patterns, and trends in emergency care. ACEP began CEDR in 2015 focusing on quantifying and enhancing quality of emergency care through collection of quality data and development of EM-specific quality metrics. CEDR has collected data for 50 million visits representing 30 million unique patients. Study Objectives: Early in the pandemic, impact on emergency departments (ED) was substantial. By May, ED visits declined nearly 40%. CDC data indicated ED visits for patients younger than 14 declined by 70%. While several studies evaluated pandemic impact on pediatric cases, most focused on childrens hospitals or particular illnesses. This research assesses the impact on pediatric visits to all US EDs over the more extended timeline of the pandemic, including total visits, visits for influenza, and visits for COVID-19. Methods: The database was queried for visit data on patients 18 years and younger from January 2019 to December 2020. Visits were counted, not individuals, so two visits by the same individual count as two visits. Percentage of visits in this cohort with a diagnosis of influenza (ICD 10 Codes: J09.X2, J10.-, J11.-) and COVID-19 (ICD 10 Code: U07.1) were calculated. Data were compared to age-agnostic ED visits and percentage of visits for COVID-19 and influenza in the general public. This data was obtained from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), run by the CDC. NSSP received data from 93% of US hospitals and is provided to ACEP through an agreement with the CDC. It includes data on the number of ED visits and percentage of those visits made for COVID-19 and influenza. Simple descriptive analysis was used. Results: Pediatric ED visits experienced a 72% decline starting week 11 of 2020, coinciding with the WHO characterization of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Sharp decline continues for six weeks before plateauing. However, pediatric visits remain 38% below previous visit rates (Figure 1). General population ED visits decline significantly over an identical period, however, only decrease by 42%. These ED visits make a quicker recovery, returning to 88% of previous patient volume. When reviewing influenza and COVID-19 data, general public visits indicated a considerable lack of influenza cases during COVID-19 surges. Conversely, pediatric visits do not demonstrate the same surges. Instead, data showed repeated smaller COVID-19 spikes during the year. In addition, pediatrics did not reveal influenza suppression seen in the general public. Spiking in pediatric influenza was proportional to COVID-19 spikes, offset in time (Figure 2). Conclusion: This study reveals pediatric ED visits sharply decreased in early weeks of the pandemic. Recovery of ED visits is slower in pediatric populations compared to the general population. Further, percentage of visits for influenza and COVID-19 remain low in this population and do not show typical waves seen in the general population. The reduction in 2020 influenza cases seen in the adult population is not reflected in the pediatric population. Influenza spiked uniquely in the pediatric population throughout 2020.

The SOP included recommendation, consideration, and avoidance of IVT if rivaroxaban plasma levels were <20 ng/mL, 20?100 ng/mL, and >100 ng/mL, respectively, measured with a calibrated anti-factor Xa assay. Patients with intracranial artery occlusion were recommended IVT+EVT or EVT alone if plasma levels were 100 ng/mL or >100 ng/mL, respectively. We evaluated the frequency of IVT/EVT, door-to-needle-time (DNT), and symptomatic intracranial or major extracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Among 114 acute stroke patients taking rivaroxaban, 68 were otherwise eligible for IVT/EVT of whom 63 had plasma levels measured (median age 81 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 6). Median rivaroxaban plasma level was 96 ng/mL (inter quartile range [IQR] 18?259 ng/mL) and time since last intake 11 hours (IQR 4.5?18.5 hours). Twenty-two patients (35%) received IVT/EVT (IVT n=15, IVT+EVT n=3, EVT n=4) based on SOP. Median DNT was 37 (IQR 30?60) minutes. None of the 31 patients with plasma levels >100 ng/mL received IVT. Among 14 patients with plasma levels 100 ng/mL, the main reason to withhold IVT was minor stroke (n=10). No symptomatic intracranial or major extracranial bleeding occurred after treatment.

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated at baseline and categorized according to World Health Organization criteria: normal or low weight (NW), overweight, Obese I and Obese II+. A repeated-effects model, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline variables, assessed outcomes. RESULTS Obesity was common (46.2%), only 25.5% were NW. Higher BMI was associated with greater medical illness (p < .001), social phobia (p = .003), and bulimia (p = .026).

Our urban emergency department (ED), a member of the NYC public hospital system had to process the increased volume while also differentiating our patients critical needs. We established a forward treatment area (FTA) directly in front of the ED to accomplish these goals from March 23CApril 16, 2020. METHODS: A clinical greeter evaluated patients 18 years and older who presented to the walk-in entrance of the ED where they were screened for COVID-19-like complaints. If they did not appear critically ill and could ambulate they were directed into the FTA. Clinical and non-clinical staff worked in concert to register, evaluate, and process patients with either a disposition of directly home or into the ED for further care. RESULTS: A total of 634 patients were seen in the FTA from March 23CApril 16, 2020. Of the 634 patients evaluated, 135 (21%) were referred into the ED for further evaluation, of whom 81 (12.7% of the total) were admitted. These patients were disproportionately male (91 into the ED and 63 admitted) and tended to have a higher heart rate (105.4 vs 93.7), a higher respiratory rate (21.5 vs 18.1), and lower oxygen saturation (93.9% vs 97.8%).

There is still a lack of understanding of its origin, transmission, and treatment methods. Understanding the influencing factors of COVID-19 can help mitigate its spread, but little research on the spatial factors has been conducted. Therefore, this study explores the effects of urban geometry and socio-demographic factors on the COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. For each patient, the places they visited during the incubation period before going to hospital were identified, and matched with corresponding attributes of urban geometry (i.e., building geometry, road network and greenspace) and socio-demographic factors (i.e., demographic, educational, economic, household and housing characteristics) based on the coordinates. The local cases were then compared with the imported cases using stepwise logistic regression, logistic regression with case-control of time, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to identify factors influencing local disease transmission.

In addition, the results indicate that urban geometry is playing a more important role than socio-demographic characteristics in affecting COVID-19 incidence.

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and three (16.7%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. CONCLUSION: Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","output":"Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Memory T-cell generation is limited by activation-induced cell death during the effector T-cell stage.

Targeting OX40 in vivo can alter the fate of T-cell survival. Enhancing OX40 signaling during Ag priming through agonists increases memory T-cell development, while blocking OX40 signaling decreases the memory T-cell pool. These two opposing outcomes provide therapeutic tools for blocking inflammation in autoimmune conditions and enhancing immunity in hosts harboring cancer or chronic pathogens.

The coagulopathic, anti-coagulopathic, and vasculopathic actions of mamushi venom result in various laboratory abnormalities, occasionally with muscular, renal, and other organ damage. We investigated the serum biomarkers that were associated with the pathogenesis of mamushi bites, focusing on markers related to tissue-damage and neutrophil activation. Twenty patients (one case of grade 2, 13 cases of grade 3, and six cases of grade 4 of severity) seen by us in one summer season were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples were taken from the patients on day 0, day 2, and day 7 after mamushi bites. In addition to routine blood examination, serum samples were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-17A, IL-22, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and IL-33. Creatinine kinase (CK) values significantly correlated with prothrombin time (PT) levels, suggesting that muscular damage is associated with exaggerated coagulation and fibrinolysis. In the vast majority of patients, HMGB1, TNF-, and IL-33 were under detection levels. Neutrophil counts did not correlate with PT or CK, indicating that the coagulation disorder and muscular damage were virtually independent of the neutrophil activation. The neutrophil number significantly correlated with CitH3, a representative marker of neutrophil extracellular traps. Moreover, there were significant correlations between neutrophil number, CitH3, IL-8, IL-22, and VEGF. Our study suggests that there are two major cascades in mamushi bites. One is an already characterized venom effect on coagulation, vessels, and muscles. In the other novel cascade, we propose that neutrophil activation with IL-8 leads to the production of IL-22 and VEGF. This sequential event may contribute to both vascular damage and repair.","output":"Elevation of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-22, and vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with venomous snake mamushi (Gloydius blomhoffii) bites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP), and Fear toward COVID-19 are an important issue when designing public health approaches to control the spread of this highly contagious disease like COVID-19 during the global pandemic period. Studies with KAP and fear measures are limited only regional or country level, not yet with global or cross-cultural populations. The study is aimed to measure KAP and fear level towards COVID-19 and explore its cross-cultural variances in knowledge by socio-demographic factors among the general population of 8 different countries over 5 continents. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1296 participants using the Google form platform. Considering the social distancing formula and pandemic situation, we collect data using popular social media networks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to explore the collected data on KAP, fear, and sociodemographic factors. Result: Overall knowledge score was 9.7 (out of 12) and gender differences (female vs male: 9.8 vs 9.5) were significant (p=0.008) in the bivariate analysis. Knowledge score variances found significant in some regions by gender, marital status and education qualification. The highest and lowest mean knowledge scores were recorded in the Middle East (10.0) and Europe (9.3). Despite having a high fear score (22.5 out of 35), 78.35% of respondents were in a positive attitude and 81.7% in good practice level. Fear score rankings: Middle East (1st; 23.8), Europe (2nd; 23.2); Africa (3rd; 22.7); South Asia (4th; 22.1); Oceania (5th; 21.9); and North America (6th; 21.7). We did not find a correlation between fear and knowledge. Limitation: Due to the nature of the online survey, aged and rural populations are under-representing (e.g. more than half of the responders are 16-29 age group). Conclusion: KAP and fear variation exist among geographical regions. Gender, marital status and education qualification are factors in knowledge variances for some regions. KAP and fear measures can assist health education programs considering some sociodemographic factors and regions during an outbreak of highly contagious disease and, which can uplift a positive attitude and good practice.

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. METHODS: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients.

METHODS From June 2010 to January 2012, 40 patients underwent a SILC [median age: 47.5 years (25-92)] and operative and peri-operative data were prospectively collected. Over the same period, 37 patients underwent a CLC. A 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for qualitative data. The costs of SILC and CLC were also compared. RESULTS For those patients undergoing a SILC the median operating time was 70 min (24-110). There were no conversions. An additional trocar was necessary in 16 patients. Four patients developed post-operative complications. The median immediate post-operative pain score was 5 (0-10). The median quality of life and cosmetic satisfaction at the initial post-operative visit were 10 (6-10) and 10 (5-10), respectively (VAS).

The aim of this project was to assess the subjective rating of the risk of infection and the willingness to be vaccinated among German ophthalmologists. METHODS: Data were collected by an anonymous online survey conducted by the Professional Association of Ophthalmologists in Germany (BVA) and the German Ophthalmological Society (DOG) under the auspices of the University Eye Hospital Dsseldorf. The questionnaire was open for participation from 22 January to 12 February 2021. The survey was addressed to all colleagues in ophthalmology. RESULTS: A total of 1162 completed questionnaires were analyzed. On average, survey respondents rated their risk of infection as 7.5a? 1.9 (scale of 1-10; 1a?= very low risk, 10a?= very high risk). Of the respondents 971 (83.6%) rated their risk of infection as higher compared to other disciplines and 92.9% (na?= 1079) indicated they would be willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmologists interviewed consider their professional group to be exposed to an above-average risk of SARS-COV-2 infection compared to other disciplines.

We aimed to report a series of patients with PCS attending a Post-COVID Unit and offer a comprehensive review on the topic. Adult patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were systematically assessed through a semi-structured and validated survey. Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143 to 258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2 to 1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive. Based on autonomic symptoms (by COMPASS 31) two clusters were obtained with different clinical characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different between clusters.

In 2007, in the first reported outbreak in Australia, the virus spread through the horse populations of two states within 4 months. Most of the geographic spread occurred within the first 10 days and was associated with the movement of infected horses prior to the implementation of movement controls. This study applies social network analysis to describe spread of equine influenza between horse premises infected in the early outbreak period, identifying spread occurring through a contact network and secondary local spatial spread. Social networks were constructed by combining contact-tracing data on horse movements with a distance matrix between all premises holding horses infected within the first 10 days of the outbreak. These networks were analysed to provide a description of the epidemic, identify premises that were central to disease spread and to estimate the relative proportion of premises infected through infected horse movements and through local spatial spread. We then explored the effect of distance on disease spread by estimating the range of local spread (through direct contact, transmission on fomites and windborne transmission) based on the level of fragmentation in the network and also by directly estimating the shape of the outbreak's spatial transmission kernel. During the first 10 days of this epidemic, 197 horse premises were infected; 70 of these were included in the contact-traced network. Most local spread occurred within 5 km. Local spread was estimated to have occurred up to a distance of 15.3 km C based on the contact-and-proximity network C and at a very low incidence beyond this distance based on the transmission kernel estimate. Of the 70 premises in the contact network, spread to 14 premises (95% CI: 9, 20 premises) was likely to have occurred through local spatial spread from nearby infected premises, suggesting that 28.3% of spread in the early epidemic period was network-associated (95% CI: 25.6, 31.0%). By constructing a maximal network of contact and proximity (based on a distance cut-off of 15.3 km), 44 spatial clusters were described, and the horse movements that initiated infection in these locations were identified. Characteristics of the combined network, incorporating both spatial and underlying contact relationships between infected premises, explained the high rate of spread, the sequence of cluster formation and the widespread dispersal experienced in the early phase of this epidemic. These results can inform outbreak control planning by guiding the imposition of appropriate control zone diameters around infected premises and the targeting of surveillance and interventions.","output":"Adding the spatial dimension to the social network analysis of an epidemic: Investigation of the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Belief updating is a relatively nascent field of research that examines how people adjust their beliefs in light of new evidence.

Available evidence suggests that both healthy people and people with particular mental disorders are prone to certain biases when updating their beliefs, although the nature of the respective biases varies considerably and depends on several factors. Anomalies in belief updating are discussed in terms of both new insights into the psychopathology of various mental disorders and societal implications, such as irreconcilable political and societal controversies due to the failure to take information into account that disconfirms one's own view.

RESULTS: BV5% was predictive of outcomes in COVID-19 patients in a multivariate model, with a BV5% threshold below 25% associated with an odds ratio (OR) 5.58 for death, OR 3.20 for intubation, and OR 2.54 for the composite of death or intubation. A model using age and BV5% had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85 to predict the composite of intubation or death in COVID-19 patients. BV5% was not predictive of clinical outcomes in patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This data suggests BV5% as a novel biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 seeking acute medical care.","output":"Altered pulmonary blood volume distribution as a biomarker for predicting outcomes in COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the problem of combining work and private life.

The increasing amount of event logs in organizations challenges current process mining techniques, which tend to load data into the memory of a computer. This issue limits the organizations to apply process mining on a large scale and introduces risks due to the lack of data management capabilities. Therefore, this paper introduces and formalizes a new approach to store and retrieve event logs into/from graph databases. It defines an algorithm to compute Directly Follows Graph (DFG) inside the graph database, which shifts the heavy computation parts of process mining into the graph database. Calculating DFG in graph databases enables leveraging the graph databases' horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities in favor of applying process mining on a large scale. Besides, it removes the requirement to move data into analysts' computer. Thus, it enables using data management capabilities in graph databases. We implemented this approach in Neo4j and evaluated its performance compared with current techniques using a real log file. The result shows that our approach enables the calculation of DFG when the data is much bigger than the computational memory. It also shows better performance when dicing data into small chunks.","output":"Graph-based process mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has put several healthcare systems under severe pressure The present analysis investigates how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the myocardial infarction (MI) network of Emilia-Romagna (Italy) Methods Based on Emilia-Romagna mortality registry and administrative data from all the hospitals from January 2017 to June 2020, we analysed: i) temporal trend in MI hospital admissions;ii) characteristics, management, and 30-day mortality of MI patients;iii) out-of-hospital mortality for cardiac cause Findings Admissions for MI declined on February 22, 2020 (IRR -19 5%, 95%CI from -8 4% to -29 3%, p = 0 001), and further on March 5, 2020 (IRR -21 6%, 95%CI from -9 0% to -32 5%, p = 0 001) The return to pre-COVID-19 MI-related admission levels was observed from May 13, 2020 (IRR 34 3%, 95%CI 20 0%-50 2%, p&lt;0 001) As compared to those before the pandemic, MI patients admitted during and after the first wave were younger and with fewer risk factors The 30-day mortality remained in line with that expected based on previous years (ratio observed/expected was 0 96, 95%CI 0 84C1 08) MI patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were few (1 5%) but showed poor prognosis (around 5-fold increase in 30-day mortality) In 2020, the number of out-of-hospital cardiac deaths was significantly higher (ratio observed/expected 1 17, 95%CI 1 08C1 27) The peak was reached in April Interpretation In Emilia-Romagna, MI hospitalizations significantly decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic Management and outcomes of hospitalized MI patients remained unchanged, except for those with SARS-CoV-2 infection A concomitant increase in the out-of-hospital cardiac mortality was observed Funding None","output":"In- and out-of-hospital mortality for myocardial infarction during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Emilia-Romagna, Italy: A population-based observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive organisms pose a global threat and are exceptionally difficult to eradicate after they become abundant in their new habitats. We report a successful multitactic strategy for combating the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), one of the world's most invasive pests. A coordinated program in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico included releases of billions of sterile pink bollworm moths from airplanes and planting of cotton engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). An analysis of computer simulations and 21 y of field data from Arizona demonstrate that the transgenic Bt cotton and sterile insect releases interacted synergistically to reduce the pest's population size. In Arizona, the program started in 2006 and decreased the pest's estimated statewide population size from over 2 billion in 2005 to zero in 2013. Complementary regional efforts eradicated this pest throughout the cotton-growing areas of the continental United States and northern Mexico a century after it had invaded both countries. The removal of this pest saved farmers in the United States $192 million from 2014 to 2019. It also eliminated the environmental and safety hazards associated with insecticide sprays that had previously targeted the pink bollworm and facilitated an 82% reduction in insecticides used against all cotton pests in Arizona.

Possible reasons for this include parental reluctance to bring their children to the ED due to fear of exposure and mandates to socially isolate (which may have also decreased infectious disease transmission) and increasing use of telemedicine. Our goal was to determine whether ED visits for some common pediatric infectious conditions changed following the arrival of COVID-19 in our area. Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: EDs of 28 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Of these, 5 hospitals had dedicated pediatric EDs. Hospitals were teaching or non-teaching and rural, suburban or urban. Annual ED volumes were from 12,000 to 122,000. Population: consecutive ED patients  18 years old between March 1 and November 30 in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We arbitrarily chose to examine the following conditions: otitis media, bronchiolitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, croup and diarrhea, identified by the International Classification of Diseases codes, version 10. We tallied total visits and visits for each of these diagnoses in 2019 and 2020 time periods.

Results We report herein a multi-organ atlas of the transcript perturbations in pregnant and non-pregnant mice in response to endotoxin. Pregnancy strongly modified the host responses to endotoxin in the uterus, cervix, and liver. In contrast, pregnancy had a milder effect on the host response to endotoxin in the adrenal gland, lung, and kidney.

METHODS: Thirty-four eyes of 34 patients with MIS-C and 36 age and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated in this prospective, cross-sectional study. The superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), ONH, FAZ parameters, the flow area of the outer retina, and choriocapillaris were evaluated using OCTA. RESULTS: All VD parameters in SCP were significantly lower in MIS-C patients. There was no significant difference between the groups in VD parameters of both DCP and ONH, as well as FAZ area and FAZ perimeter. However, foveal density (FD-300) was significantly decreased in the MIS-C group. (p = 0.024). The outer retina flow area at 1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm radius and CC flow area at 1 mm and 2 mm radius were significantly lower in the MIS-C group than in the control group. Although CC flow area at 3 mm radius was decreased in the MIS-C group compared to healthy controls, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a decreased vessel density in SCP, choriocapillaris flow area, and outer retinal flow area in MIS-C patients.

Selenium is also a potential toxin at higher concentrations, and multiple environmental disasters over the past 50 years have been caused by Se pollution from agricultural and industrial sources. Phytoremediation by plants able to take up large amounts of Se is an important tool to combat pollution issues.

Selenium uptake and translocation in plants is largely accomplished via sulfur (S) transport proteins. Current understanding of these transporters is reviewed here, and transporters that may be manipulated to improve Se uptake are discussed. Plant Se metabolism also largely follows the S metabolic pathway. This pathway is reviewed here, with special focus on genes that have been, or may be manipulated to reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolites or enhance the accumulation of nontoxic metabolites. Finally, unique aspects of Se transport and metabolism in Se hyperaccumulators are reviewed.

This study analysed the nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami in floating cages in Lake Maninjau. Method A total of 20 floating cages were used to record these nutrients in feed supply, female and male juvenile fish, dead fish and harvested fish to estimate nutrient loading. Data on the harvested fish, production cycle, stock number and cage capacity were used to estimate the stocking density, feeding rate, feed efficiency, and net fish yield, and the relationship between feed supply and nutrient loading and farm characteristics was analysed by least squares regression methods. Results A total of 20 floating cages released nutrients into waterbodies at an average rate of 236.2760.44 kg/cycle for C, 84.5220.86 kg/cycle for N and 8.703.63 kg/cycle for P. On average, fish production for each floating cage (SD) was 1226282 kg wet weight/cycle, and the net fish yield was 12.632.82 kg/m (3)/cycle. Survival rates ranged from 86.33 to 95.27%/cycle. The production cycles varied from 160 to 175 days with feed conversion ratios between 1.60 and 1.75, feed conversion efficiencies were between 0.58 and 0.63. The production parameters that had strong relationships with the net fish yield were feed supply ( r (2)=0.960), stocking rates ( r (2)=0.924) and feeding rates ( r (2)=0.961). In contrast, the length of the production cycle was not strongly related to the net fish yield ( r (2)=0.187). Conclusion Nutrient loading from the supplied feed was greater than that from the harvested fish, juvenile fish and dead fish. Increasing the net fish yield in floating cages was better predicted by the stocking densities and feeding levels than by the other factors.","output":"Nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami fish aquaculture systems in Lake Maninjau, Indonesia: basic knowledge of production performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent digital revolution led robots to become integrated more than ever into different domains such as agricultural, medical, industrial, military, police (law enforcement), and logistics.

In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients.

The review identified 14 studies published in the UK from 2010. The services provided generated on average 27GBP of social, economic and environmental return on investment per 1GBP invested. Individuals on average benefitted from an additional 2,757GBP household income per annum and cost savings for the NHS were demonstrated. The review demonstrated that improvements to health were made by addressing key social determinants of health, thereby reducing health inequalities. Co-located welfare services actively incorporated elements of proportionate universalism and targeted those, who due to predominately health needs, were most in need of this support. The nature of the welfare advice service, how it operates within a health setting, and how visible and accessible this service is to participants and professionals referring into the service, were seen as important facilitators. Co-production during service development and ongoing enhanced multi-disciplinary collaboration were also considered vital to the success of co-located services.","output":"A review of the effectiveness and experiences of welfare advice services co-located in health settings: a critical narrative systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study compares the effectiveness of COVID-19 control policies on the viruss spread and on the change of the infection dynamics in China, Germany, Austria, and the USA relying on a regression discontinuity in time and earlyR epidemic models.

We aimed to identify the factors associated with the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia induced by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We prospectively enrolled a single-center case series of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital of Jining, Jining City, Shandong Province, China, from January 24 to March 1, 2020. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings were compared to investigate the risk factors related with the disease severity of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Results: We included a total of 78 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 6 had the severe type. As compared to a moderately ill cohort, our analysis showed that shortness of breath, fatigue, longer days from illness onset to diagnosis confirmed, neutrophil percentages > 70%, neutrophil counts > 6.3  109/L, lymphocyte percentages < 20%, lymphocyte counts < 1.0  109/L, platelet < 100  109/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, neutrophil to platelet ratio (NPR) > 2.3, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 3.9, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 40 U/L, albumin < 40 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 245 U/L, and glucose > 6.1 mmol/L were predictors of disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia.

We aimed to examine gender differences of social harms from drinking as reported by drinkers. METHODS: 2,200 young adults at age 30 with complete data on social harms from drinking were drawn from the 30-year follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy. Measures included percentages of 11 past-year drinkers' self-reported social harms stratified by gender. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between gender and each social harm, accounting for relevant confounding. RESULTS: More than one in five young adults (22%) reported at least one social harm in the past year. Among binge drinkers, 44% reported at least one social harm. After adjustments for social roles and binge drinking, we found no gender differences on several self-reported social harms: friendship problems, people criticizing drinking, non-marital family problems, employment problems, and alcohol-fuelled fights. However, men were more likely to report spousal threats to leave, drink-driving legal problems and financial problems. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that young adults are still vulnerable to risky drinking at age 30 and the social harm resulting from drinking. Thus, alcohol prevention campaigns should target this age group and include women in their focus. Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol-related harms, such as screening in clinical settings for risky drinking and alcohol-related harms, followed by motivational behavior interventions, could be beneficial among these vulnerable groups.","output":"Gender differences in social harms from drinking among young Australians: findings from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES A carefully chosen and suitably prepared kidney donor is essential in living-donor kidney transplantation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an effective imaging method for evaluating the renovascular morphology of donor candidates. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal artery variations in kidney donors using CTA and compare the findings with the number of arteries detected during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 2,144 living donors who underwent pretransplant renovascular assessment using CTA and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in our center between August 2012 and October 2018. The number of renal arteries to the donor kidney detected on CTA was compared with the number of arteries discovered intraoperatively. RESULTS The mean age of the 2,144 living kidney donors included in the study was 47.19  13.3 (18-87) years. According to CTA findings, 81.1% (n = 1,738) had a single renal artery, 17.2% (n = 369) had double renal arteries, 1.6% (n = 35) had triple renal arteries, and 0.1% (n = 2) had quadruple renal arteries. The same number of renal arteries were detected by CTA and in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in 97.9% (n = 2,099) of the donors. In the other 2.1% (n = 45), fewer renal arteries were detected intraoperatively compared to their CTA findings. None of the donors included in the study had a greater number of renal arteries discovered during nephrectomy than by CTA. CONCLUSION CTA is a highly accurate method for the evaluation of renovascular variations in donor candidates for living-donor kidney transplantation. However, it must be kept in mind that double or multiple renal artery variations may be detected on CTA in 18.9% of donor candidates.","output":"Evaluation of the Renal Arteries of 2,144 Living Kidney Donors Using Computed Tomography Angiography and Comparison with Intraoperative Findings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this modern world, people are becoming more self-centered and unsocial.

Pinus krempfii, a flat-leaved pine endemic to the Central Highlands of Vietnam, provides a notable exception as it seems to compete successfully with shade-tolerant tropical species. Here, we test the hypothesis that successful conifer performance at the juvenile stage depends on physiological traits of shade tolerance by comparing the physiological characteristics of P. krempfii to coexisting species from two taxa: the genus Pinus, and a relatively abundant and shade tolerant conifer family found in pantropical forests, the Podocarpaceae. We examined leaf photosynthetic, respiratory and biochemical traits. Additionally, we compiled attainable maximum photosynthesis, maximum RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and maximum electron transport (Jmax) values for Pinus and Podocarpaceae species from the literature. In our literature compilation, P. krempfii was intermediate between Pinus and Podocarpaceae in its maximum photosynthesis and its Vcmax. Pinus exhibited a higher Vcmax than Podocarpaceae, resulting in a less steep slope in the linear relationship between Jmax and Vcmax. These results suggest that Pinus may be more shade intolerant than Podocarpaceae with P. krempfii falling between the two taxa. However, in contrast, Vietnamese conifers' leaf mass per areas and biochemical traits did not highlight the same intermediate nature of P. krempfii. Furthermore, regardless of leaf morphology or family assignation, all species demonstrated a common and extremely high carbon gain efficiency. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of shade tolerant photosynthetic traits for conifer survival in tropical forests. However, they also demonstrate a diversity of shade tolerance strategies, all of which lead to the persistence of Vietnamese juvenile conifers in low-light tropical understories.","output":"Contrasting physiological traits of shade tolerance in Pinus and Podocarpaceae native to a tropical Vietnamese forest: Insight from an aberrant flat-leaved pine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the knowledge, awareness and attitudes of medical students towards recently discovered coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","output":"Prognostic factors in patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19: Findings from the CORONADO study and other recent reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Paramedics respond to emergency scenes in often uncontrolled settings without being aware of potential risks. This makes paramedicine one of the most dangerous occupations. One of these dangers is the risk of contracting infectious diseases. Research in this area is predominantly focused on compliance in the use of protective equipment, attitudes and perceptions of paramedics, infectious disease policy, and exposure rates to blood and body fluids. The purpose of this scoping review was to determine what is known about the impact of infectious disease on the health of paramedics. METHODS Using the Arskey and O'Malley methodological framework, a scoping review was undertaken, which allows for a broad search of the available evidence. RESULTS The literature search identified eight articles for review that reported on paramedic exposure trends; the lack of reported blood-borne infections contracted, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); instances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections; and the higher prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal infections amongst paramedics. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to infectious diseases is decreasing, yet it remains significant. The decrease is attributed to prevention strategies; however, paramedic knowledge and attitudes as well as the uncontrolled environment paramedics work in can be a barrier. Contraction of infectious diseases is generally low; exceptions to this are MRSA colonization, influenza, and SARS.

We have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance along with four commercial ELISAs, EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP? COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the probable causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were evaluated using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of false positive results from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, assays lacked reproducibility. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with the same antigen that was used for coating ELISAs prior to performing the assay), suggesting positive reaction could be attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by the spiking, suggesting positive reaction was not attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of \\"false positivity\\" in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the corresponding antigen, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system.

Methods: Participants were studied before and after mRNA vaccination in a community-based, home-collected, longitudinal serosurvey; none reported hospitalization for COVID-19. Prior to vaccination, some reported prior positive acute viral diagnostic testing and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Participants who did not report acute viral diagnostic testing were categorized as seropositive or seronegative based on anti-spike RBD IgG test results. Primary measures were anti-spike RBD IgG concentration and percent antibody-mediated neutralization of spike protein-ACE2 interaction prior to vaccination, and after one or two doses of vaccine. Results: Of 290 unique vaccine recipients, 42 reported a prior COVID-19 diagnosis and were seropositive (COVID-19+). Of the 248 with no history of acute viral diagnostic testing, 105 were seropositive and 143 seronegative before vaccination. The median age was 38yrs (range 21-83) with 65% female and 35% male; 40% were non-white. Responses were evaluated after one (n=140) or two (n=170) doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine.

Wilcoxon test was used to compare the duration of resuscitation between two cohorts. Wilcoxon test was used to compare the duration. The statistical analysis was carried using R 4.0.3 and p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were a total of 442 patients, 384 in non- COVID-19 cohort and 58 in COVID-19 cohort. The mean age of the study population was 61.3 (16.2) years and 44.5% were females. In 90.8% (n=385) patients, rhythm was nonshockable. After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in the mean duration of resuscitation in COVID-19 (n=57) and non-COVID cohort (n=114) (13.1 (11.7) vs 11.4 (10.2), p=0.470). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that there was no significant change in the duration of the resuscitation attempts in patients with COVID-19 when compared to the historic cohort of critically ill patients who had an IHCA. The favorable outcomes we noted in our patient cohort is related to the systems of care, the large ICU capacity, expansive restructuring of critical care resources and investment into critical care COVID 19 specific education.","output":"COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 inhospital cardiac arrest survival at a large us healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases have been a preeminent part of literature since the earliest human writings. In particular, they have contributed greatly to the genre of horror-written or visual art intended to startle or scare. Horror fiction has emphasized infectious themes from the earliest Babylonian and Hebrew texts. In medieval times, stories of vampires and werewolves often had a contagious component, and pivotal works of Victorian horror centered around fear of infection and contamination. As film became prominent in the 20th Century, a strong emphasis on themes of plague and apocalypse developed. An analysis of the use of infection in horror fiction and film shows that it often represents a metaphor for societal concerns, and it is extremely useful in framing challenging issues for a wide audience.","output":"Contagious Horror: Infectious Themes in Fiction and Film."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, we focused on the origins of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), origin, pathogenesis, immune responses, genes and genetic variations, phylogenetic analyses, and potential therapeutic strategies to summarize approaches for developing broadly effective preventions and vaccines to cope COVID-19.

There is growing awareness and concerns about this issue, especially during COVID-19;however, there is a paucity of published data (1, 2). Aim: To use a questionnaire to explore the misuse of OTC/POM by adults accessing SMS, including the types of medication involved, demographic characteristics, the use of other substances and changes during COVID-19. Methods: Following successful piloting, an anonymous (online/paper) self-administered survey was completed by English-speaking adults (18 years or over) currently accessing SMS with a purposive sampling approach. This was undertaken in community SMS across England, provided by one of the UK's largest third sector organisations. Quantitative analysis was undertaken using SPSS and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results: In 2021, 80 questionnaires were completed, and the 56 that met the inclusion criteria were analysed. All were caucasian (94.6% British), aged between 18 and 61 years and the majority identified as male (58.9%). Forty respondents (71.4%) were in receipt of prescribed interventions for their use of substances, with an adherence rate of 92.5% despite increased liberalisation of dispensing arrangements and additional challenges during COVID-19. In the preceding month 44.6% used alcohol (52% daily), 73.2% used tobacco/vaped and 58.9% used illicit substances concomitantly. Twenty-one (37.5%) reported misusing more than one OTC/POM, route of administration was predominantly oral and ease of their availability was conveyed. Relationships between categories were tested using chi-square/Fisher's exact test and statistically significant relationships (p <0.05) were identified between the misuse of codeine and the prescribing of oral opioid substitute treatment, and changes during COVID-19 to OTC/POM and illicit misuse. Generally respondents were very complimentary about SMS, outlining the positive impact of accessing pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. However, the need for more training/education and psychologically informed approaches by GPs and pharmacies was highlighted: there was a theme of primary care restrictions on access to medicines leading to escalating OTC/POM misuse and increased use of unregulated illicit sources. Conclusion: Conducting research during a pandemic is exceptionally challenging. OTC/POM misuse is occurring amongst people accessing SMS and polypharmacy is concerning. A renewed approach to liberalisation, withdrawal management and training for primary care professionals must be considered. Improvements at a systems-level and changes to commissioning/national pathways may assist this and further research is required to explore the themes identified.","output":"Exploring over the Counter and Prescription Only Medication Misuse amongst Adults Accessing Specialist Treatment Services: a Survey during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to describe the likely positive effects of alpha-linolenic acid supplementation on the lung and the negative effects of it on the adipose tissue of COVID-19 patients Design/methodology/approach: This paper focuses on investigating the effects of alpha-linolenic (ALA) on the respiratory system and adipose tissue of COVID-19 patients Findings: ALA can help human respiratory system by improving lung damage On the other hand, when it comes to adipose tissue, it can induce the overexpression of glucose transporter-4 gene and impair COVID-19 prognosis Originality/value: Despite the inconclusive pieces of evidence, improving the quality of patients diet may help mitigating their risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection Further research studies are necessary to help finding a safe ALA recommendation focused on preventing and improving lung damage, as well as on stopping adipose cells from working as COVID-19 reservoirs ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Likely positive effect of alpha-linolenic acid supplementation on the lung and the negative effect of it on the adipose tissue of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic depends on the profound investigation of the virus biology and its consequences We aimed to analyze the COVID-19 research productivity of authors representing different countries and associations between the number of articles and COVID-19 spread Methods We retrieved all articles on COVID-19 indexed in PubMed between 31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020 We identified the countries of individual authors' affiliations We performed the R Spearman rank correlation test between the number of articles with at least one author from a country per one million citizens and Human Development Index (HDI), a number of COVID- 19 cases and deaths per one million citizens before 1 July 2020 Results Overall, we identified 27,815 articles, including 18,225 original contributions, 2,449 reviews, and 69 meta-analyses on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection The highest productivity characterized the authors coming from China (n = 11,519 articles with at least one author), followed by the United States of America (n = 9,666) and Italy ( n = 7,261) The number of articles on COVID-19 associated with HDI (Rs = 0 79), the numbers of cases (Rs = 0 47), and deaths (Rs = 0 46) (all p &lt; 0 001) Conclusions Early COVID-19 researches were most often authored by researchers from highly developed countries and those affected by the rapid initial spread of SARS-CoV-2","output":"The Productivity of Medical Publication on COVID-19 in the First Half of 2020: A Retrospective Analysis of Articles Available in PubMed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with hematologic malignancies are at a high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID\\\\19.

Fifteen million doses were initially made available to pediatric providers to ensure the broadest possible access for the estimated 28 million eligible children aged 5-11 years, especially those in high social vulnerability index (SVI) communities. Initial supply was strategically distributed to maximize vaccination opportunities for U.S. children aged 5-11 years. COVID-19 vaccination coverage among persons aged 12-17 years has lagged (1), and vaccine confidence has been identified as a concern among parents and caregivers (2). Therefore, COVID-19 provider access and early vaccination coverage among children aged 5-11 years in high and low SVI communities were examined during November 1, 2021-January 18, 2022. As of November 29, 2021 (4 weeks after program launch), 38,732 providers were enrolled, and 92% of U.S. children aged 5-11 years lived within 5 miles of an active provider. As of January 18, 2022 (11 weeks after program launch), 39,786 providers had administered 13.3 million doses.

Patients were allocated into either the natural evacuation group (NE group) or the active suction group (AS group). In the AS group, active suction was applied by inserting the laparoscopic suction irrigation device through a 5-mm trocar for 60 seconds at the end of surgery. A chest X-ray was taken at postoperative Day 1, and the residual intraabdominal gas volume was measured. Perioperative data including pain score and analgesic requirement were collected. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were allocated to the NE group, and 36 were allocated to the AS group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic data and operative findings. However, a significant difference was observed in the residual intraperitoneal gas volume, with 15.96.8 mL in the NE group and 6.74.0 mL in the AS group (P<.001). Significant differences were also observed in the pain scores measured 6 hours after surgery, on postoperative Day 1, and on postoperative Day 2.

On January 5, 2022, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) recommended that persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection isolate for 10 days after symptom onset (or, for asymptomatic persons, 10 days after a positive nucleic acid amplification or antigen test result).

To overcome this problem, we developed a ?7- mm 3-D endoscope that can switch between providing front and front-diagonal view 3-D images by simply rotating its sleeves. METHODS This 3-D endoscope consists of a conventional 3-D endoscope and an outer and inner sleeve with a beam splitter and polarization plates. The beam splitter was used for visualizing both the front and front-diagonal view and was set at 25 to the outer sleeve's distal end in order to eliminate a blind spot common to both views. Polarization plates were used to avoid overlap of the two views. We measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sharpness, chromatic aberration (CA), and viewing angle of this 3-D endoscope and evaluated its feasibility in vivo. RESULTS Compared to the conventional 3-D endoscope, SNR and sharpness of this 3-D endoscope decreased by 20 and 7 %, respectively. No significant difference was found in CA.

We aimed to develop a genetically attenuated blood-stage vaccine and test its safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. Our approach was to target the gene encoding the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), which is responsible for the assembly of knob structures at the infected erythrocyte surface. Knobs are required for correct display of the polymorphic adhesion ligand P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a key virulence determinant encoded by a repertoire of var genes. METHODS: The gene encoding KAHRP was deleted from P. falciparum 3D7 and a master cell bank was produced in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice. Eight malaria na?ve males were intravenously inoculated (day 0) with 1800 (2 subjects), 1.8  10(5) (2 subjects), or 3  10(6) viable parasites (4 subjects). Parasitemia was measured using qPCR; immunogenicity was determined using standard assays. Parasites were rescued into culture for in vitro analyses (genome sequencing, cytoadhesion assays, scanning electron microscopy, var gene expression). RESULTS: None of the subjects who were administered with 1800 or 1.8  10(5) parasites developed parasitemia; 3/4 subjects administered 3 10(6) parasites developed significant parasitemia, first detected on days 13, 18, and 22. One of these three subjects developed symptoms of malaria simultaneously with influenza B (day 17; 14,022 parasites/mL); one subject developed mild symptoms on day 28 (19,956 parasites/mL); and one subject remained asymptomatic up to day 35 (5046 parasites/mL). Parasitemia rapidly cleared with artemether/lumefantrine. Parasitemia induced a parasite-specific antibody and cell-mediated immune response. Parasites cultured ex vivo exhibited genotypic and phenotypic properties similar to inoculated parasites, although the var gene expression profile changed during growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first clinical investigation of a genetically attenuated blood-stage human malaria vaccine.

The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities.

The potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients with DM and cardiovascular (CV disease have been augmented by evidence from CV outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) demonstrating significant reduction in major adverse CV events (MACE) and with SGLT2i, significantly reduction in HFrelated hospitalization. (3) Given this evidence there is a need for specialist clinicians to assist in overcoming clinical inertia in their implementation to improve patient care and prognosis. (3) Purpose To review the initial activity and clinical interventions resulting from an innovative cardiometabolic clinic (CMC) service within an NHS tertiary cardiac centre, incorporating a consultant diabetologist and cardiologist, in which patients' concomitant CV and metabolic risk are addressed simultaneously. Methods Patient data (biochemistry, radiology results and observations including weight, symptoms, blood pressure, blood glucose) and clinic activity (consultation notes and GP correspondence) were reviewed retrospectively over a 6 month period from 29/09/2020 to 29/03/2021. Results A total of 144 patients have been referred to CMC, of which 64 were seen during the study period, 6 did not attend, and 74 await an appointment. Of the 64 seen, 13 have been discharged back to the referrer and/or to a more appropriate clinician. Referrals to other specialists have been made for 26 patients to augment their care.Initiation of SGLT2 and GLP-1 was recommended for 31 and 9 patients, respectively. Up-titration of existing SGLT2i and GLP-1 was carried out for two patients already on each of these agents. Additionally, 28 other medications were initiated or optimised (5 diuretics, 3 antihypertensives, 3 lipid-lowering therapies, 2 beta blockers, 1 angiotensin-receptor blocker, 1 anticoagulant, 2 orlistat, 8 metformin and 3 other anti-diabetics). Medications for 12 patients were stopped due to contraindication, intolerance or to permit introduction of evidence- based therapy.Each consultation has also included discussion of lifestyle interventions as per latest ESC guidelines. Among the 32 patients in whom antidiabetic drugs (including SGLT2, GLP-1) have been initiated or titrated, one available marker of clinical effect associated with these interventions has been glycaemic control as quantified by HbA1c. Reduction in HbA1c has been observed in 11 patients (mean reduction 17.7 mmol/mol), while 3 have noted an increase (mean 4.7 mmol/mol, and results are pending for 18 patients.Collection of outcomes including hospitalisations for HF, CV events, ejection fraction, and adverse effects of treatment is ongoing.The above has been achieved despite limitations imposed by the remote nature of the clinic due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which limits performance of blood tests, echocardiograms and observations. This limitation is expected to be ameliorated by conducting in-person clinics in future. Conclusions Operation of a joint CMC facilitates optimisation of the pharmacological management of risk factors in patients with cardiac and metabolic disease, particularly incorporation of current evidence-based therapies. Emerging outcomes indicate the potential impact of this service on patients' long term CV outcomes.","output":"Introduction of a multidisciplinary cardiac metabolic clinic in a UK tertiary cardiology centre: Early activity, interventions and potential for cardiovascular risk optimisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In his Capital and Ideology, Thomas Piketty (2019) deepens and broadens his historical and material analysis of the institutional sources of wealth and income inequality Fueled by an expanded data base, he extends his position to cover the globe In his earlier work, he disavowed Kuznets, demonstrating that under noliberal capitalism, concentration of wealth continues at the top of the economic ladder, while indifferent to the suffering among those at the bottom With his data he demonstrates that the problem of inequality is due only partly to capitalism as technical machine, and moreso to the way governments facilitate it in favor of their elites This occurs thanks to an informal and unchallenged ideological consensus, that the wealthy have earned the right to their advantage, as have also?in negative terms, the poor Without major restructuring, this is the inevitable yield under the ?regimes of inequality?, which with minor variation today characterize all major nations around the world As alternative, he proposes a participative-socialism, with modification concerning the nature of property, its distribution and ownership, supported by alterations in market regulation, economic rights, worker participation in enterprises, education, citizen engagement and environmental responsibility","output":"Thomas Pikettys Historical-Institutional Study of Wealth and Income Inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The glycosyltransferase alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) is a Type II membrane protein localized to the Golgi apparatus.

This section of ST contains a transmembrane segment which serves as a non-cleaved signal anchor. When lysozyme was fused to an equivalent region of a cell surface protein it now appeared on the cell surface. Analysis of chimeras between the two proteins revealed that the transmembrane segment of ST specifies Golgi retention.

However, the retaining effect of the transmembrane domain of ST is augmented by the presence of adjacent lumenal and cytoplasmic sequences from ST. If these sequences are spaced apart by a transmembrane domain of the same length as that of ST they too can specify Golgi retention.

Studies have shown an association between thrombin generation (TG) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but results have been equivocal. Our aim was to study the predictive ability of TG assay in evaluating coronary stenosis severity. METHODS: In this prospective study we recruited patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or acute chest pain (without evidence of myocardial injury) planned for coronary angiography. Thrombin generation was evaluated by Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) prior to angiography. Primary end points were significant coronary stenosis and the Syntax I score evaluated by coronary angiography. RESULTS: From April 2018 through September 2019, we recruited 128 patients. In the primary analysis there was no significant association between TG and significant coronary stenosis nor between TG and syntax I score, however, there was a positive correlation between peak height and troponin peak (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.194, P-value = 0.035). In sub-group analysis, the chest pain group bare no association between TG and coronary stenosis. In unstable angina group there was an association between peak height and significant coronary stenosis (P-value = 0.029), and in non ST-elevation myocardial infarction group, TG values possessed a relatively good predictive ability of significant coronary stenosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ~65%) and a positive correlation between both lag time and ttpeak with the syntax I score was noticed (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.31, P-value = 0.099 and Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37, P-value = 0.045 respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with acute chest pain, TG values, evaluated by CAT, do not predict severity of coronary stenosis, nor do they possess prognostic value.

Over the past decade, plasma D-dimer levels have emerged as a biomarker for predicting stroke outcome. However, no consensus in the literature currently exists concerning its utility for predicting post-stroke functional outcome and mortality. Objective: To systematically review the effectiveness of plasma D-dimer levels for predicting functional outcome and mortality following stroke. Methods: Five academic databases were screened according to PRISMA guidelines for eligible studies. With these studies, we conducted a random-effect meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of plasma D-dimer levels for predicting functional outcome and mortality post-stroke. We also conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate differences in predictive capacity for different stroke subtypes. Results: Nineteen studies were included, containing data on 5,781 stroke patients (mean age: 65.26  6.4 years). Overall methodological quality for the included studies was high. Meta-analysis showed that increased D-dimer levels were predictive of worsened functional outcomes (Hazard ratio: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63C2.93) and elevated overall mortality (2.29, 1.35C3.88). Subgroup analysis showed that plasma D-dimer levels were more predictive of poorer functional outcomes for ischemic (2.08, 1.36C3.18) stroke as compared to intracerebral hemorrhage (2.62, 1.65C4.17). We also noted that predictive capacity was similar when it came to mortality in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke (2.65, 0.87C8.08) and intracerebral hemorrhage (2.63, 1.50C4.59).

With rising cases in many countries, and likely further peaks in the coming colder seasons, ventilator triage guidance remains a central part of the COVID-19 policy response. The dominant model in ventilator triage guidelines prioritises the ethical principles of saving the most lives and saving the most life-years. We sought to ascertain to what extent this focus aligns, or conflicts, with the preferences of disadvantaged minority populations. We conducted a bibliographical search of PubMed and Google Scholar and reviewed all ventilator rationing guidelines included in major recent systematic reviews, yielding 589 studies before screening. Post screening, we found six studies comprising a total of 10 591 participants, with 1247 from disadvantaged populations. Three studies reported findings stratified by race and age, two of which stratified by income. Studies included two to seven principles; all included 'save the most lives'. Involvement of disadvantaged minority populations in eliciting preferences is very limited; few studies capture race and income. This is concerning, as despite relatively small numbers and framing effects there is an observable and plausible trend suggesting that disadvantaged groups worry that dominant principles reduce their chances of receiving a ventilator. To avoid compounding prior historical and structural disadvantage, policy makers need to engage more fully with these populations in designing and justifying ventilator rationing guidance and review their adequacy. Likewise, clinicians need to be aware that their implementation of dominant triage guidelines is viewed with higher levels of concern by minority populations.","output":"COVID-19 ventilator rationing protocols: why we need to know more about the views of those with most to lose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aims to identify the variants of SARS CoV 2 that were circulating in Ethiopia and spot dynamic mutational changes of spike antigenicity based on genome data analysis to put forward preventative measurement against pandemic.

Recent studies indicated that the SARS-CoV viral spike glycoprotein is a class I viral fusion protein. A fusion peptide present at the N-terminal region of class I viral fusion proteins is believed to initiate viral and cell membrane interactions and subsequent fusion. Although the SARS-CoV fusion protein heptad repeats have been well characterized, the fusion peptide has yet to be identified. Based on the conserved features of known viral fusion peptides and using Wimley and White interfacial hydrophobicity plots, we have identified two putative fusion peptides (SARS(WW-I) and SARS(WW-II)) at the N terminus of the SARS-CoV S2 subunit. Both peptides are hydrophobic and rich in alanine, glycine, and/or phenylalanine residues and contain a canonical fusion tripeptide along with a central proline residue. Only the SARS(WW-I) peptide strongly partitioned into the membranes of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), adopting a beta-sheet structure. Likewise, only SARS(WW-I) induced the fusion of LUV and caused membrane leakage of vesicle contents at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:50 and 1:100, respectively. The activity of this synthetic peptide appeared to be dependent on its amino acid (aa) sequence, as scrambling the peptide rendered it unable to partition into LUV, assume a defined secondary structure, or induce both fusion and leakage of LUV. Based on the activity of SARS(WW-I), we propose that the hydrophobic stretch of 19 aa corresponding to residues 770 to 788 is a fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV S2 subunit.","output":"Identification and characterization of the putative fusion peptide of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"s-Block metal carbenoids are carbene synthons and applied in a myriad of organic transformations.

While the sodium and potassium chloride car-benoids showed high stabilities independent of the solvent, the lithium carbenoid was stable at room temperature in THF but decomposed at -10 C in toluene. These divergent stabilities could be explained by the different structures formed in solution. In contrast to simple organolithium reagents, the monomeric THF-solvate was found to be more stable than the dimer in toluene, since the latter more readily forms direct Li/Cl interactions which facilitate decomposition via -elimination.","output":"Solvation Effects on the Structure and Stability of Alkali Metal Carbenoids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can be pre-screened based on symptoms and confirmed using other laboratory tests.

Although symptomatic antibiotic treatment controls lung infections early in disease, lifelong bacterial residence typically ensues. Processes that control the establishment of persistent bacteria in the CF lung, and the contribution of noninfectious components to disease pathogenesis, are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether continuous antibiotic therapy protects the CF lung from disease using a ferret model that rapidly acquires lethal bacterial lung infections in the absence of antibiotics. METHODS CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)-knockout ferrets were treated with three antibiotics from birth to several years of age and lung disease was followed by quantitative computed tomography, BAL, and histopathology. Lung disease was compared with CFTR-knockout ferrets treated symptomatically with antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Bronchiectasis was quantified from computed tomography images. BAL was evaluated for cellular differential and features of inflammatory cellular activation, bacteria, fungi, and quantitative proteomics. Semiquantitative histopathology was compared across experimental groups. We demonstrate that lifelong antibiotics can protect the CF ferret lung from infections for several years. Surprisingly, CF animals still developed hallmarks of structural bronchiectasis, neutrophil-mediated inflammation, and mucus accumulation, despite the lack of infection. Quantitative proteomics of BAL from CF and non-CF pairs demonstrated a mucoinflammatory signature in the CF lung dominated by Muc5B and neutrophil chemoattractants and products.

Thirty were flagged based on scores; 37 (32.5%) participating patients requested help. Participants who were flagged for concerning scores were younger, more likely to be on the wait list for treatment, to have been laid off from work and have more functional impairment. Participants requesting support had higher symptom scores for depression and lower scores on quality of health. CONCLUSIONS: The process utilized here identified patients at risk and in need of clinical support in the context of pandemic quarantine.

RECENT FINDINGS Each year, a high volume of patients undergoes ambulatory surgery worldwide. The multimodal analgesia proposed to ambulatory patients must provide the best analgesic effect and patient satisfaction while respecting the rules of safety for ambulatory surgery. The role of nurses, anesthesiologists, and surgeons around said surgery is to relieve suffering, achieve early mobilization and patient satisfaction, and reduce duration of stay in hospital. Currently, and particularly in North America, overprescription of opioids has reached a critical level constituting a 'crisis'. Thus, we see the need to offer more optimal multimodal analgesia strategies to ambulatory patients. SUMMARY These strategies must combine three key components when not contraindicated: regional/local analgesia, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Adjuvants such as gabapentinoids, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators, glucocorticoids, 2-adrenergic receptor agonists, intravenous lidocaine might be added to the initial multimodal strategy, however, caution must be used regarding their side effects and risks of delaying recovery after ambulatory surgery. Weaker opioids (e.g. oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol) could be used rather than more powerful ones (e.g. morphine, hydromorphone, inhaled fentanyl, sufentanil). This, combined with education about postoperative weaning of opioids after surgery must be done in order to avoid long-term reliance of these drugs.","output":"Pharmacological strategies in multimodal analgesia for adults scheduled for ambulatory surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate if there would be increased autonomy and participation in meaningful occupations and positive perception of the program after attending Empower SCI and to investigate whether participation and autonomy improved in individual's daily lives after attending Empower SCI 2-week summer program.

ONG is most commonly seen in the pediatric population, in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. However, sporadic adult cases may also occur and may clinically behave more aggressively, despite benign histopathology. Genetic characterization of these tumors, particularly in the adult population, is lacking. A 39-year-old female presented with 1 month of progressive left-sided visual loss secondary to a enhancing mass along the left optic nerve sheath. Initial empiric management with focal radiotherapy failed to prevent tumor progression, prompting open biopsy which revealed a WHO I pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve. Whole-exome sequencing of the biopsy specimen revealed somatic mutations in NF1,FGFR1 and PTPN11 that may provide actionable targets for molecularly guided therapies. Genetic characterization of ONG is lacking but is needed to guide the management of these rare but complex tumors. The genomic alterations reported in this case contributes to understanding the pathophysiology of adult sporadic ONG and may help guide future clinical prognostication and development of targeted therapies.","output":"Genetic characterization of an aggressive optic nerve pilocytic glioma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In December 2019, the first cases of respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus were detected The causative agento f the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, and in the first months of 2020 it spread throughout the world as a pandemic Method: The most relevant publications concerned with the aims of the review were examined Results: The disease, known as COVID-19 Patients show cough, fever, and respiratory distress The most severe forms, mainly affecting the elderly and associated with various comorbidities, are manifested by impaired respiratory function, requiring mechanical ventilation, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which can lead to septic shock with multi-organ failure and high mortality rates This review examines the current state of knowledge about the characteristics and origin of SA RS-CoV-2, its replication, and the pathogenesis, dinical, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 Conclusions: The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are well known PCR is the reference technique for laboratory diagnosis;assays for the detection of antigens and antibodies are available, with optimization possibilities Treatment protocols include attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response and administration of antiviral agents There are vaccines in development","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and acute respiratory sindrome pandemic (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although there is an established literature regarding brand transgressions, Covid-19 has highlighted the need to better understand exogenously created brand crises.

Distrust of vaccines can hinder the rapid and effective use of this remedy. One of the means of expressing the thoughts of society is social media. Determining the time intervals during which anti-vaccination increases in social media can help institutions determine the strategy to be used in combating anti-vaccination. Recording and tracking every tweet entered with human labor would be inefficient, so various automation solutions are needed. In this study, The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which is a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model, was used. In a dataset of 1506 tweets divided into four different categories as news, irrelevant, anti-vaccine, and vaccine supporters, the model was trained with a learning rate of 5e-6 for 25 epochs. To determine the intervals in which anti-vaccine tweets are concentrated, the categories to which 652840 tweets belong were determined by using the trained model. The change of the determined categories overtime was visualized and the events that could cause the change were determined. As a result of model training, in the test dataset, the f-score of 0.81 and AUC values for different classes were obtained as 0.99,0.91, 0.92, 0.92, respectively. In this model, unlike the studies in the literature, an auxiliary system is designed that provides data that institutions can use when determining their strategy by measuring and visualizing the frequency of anti-vaccine tweets in a time interval, different from detecting and censoring such tweets.","output":"Detection of Increased Time Intervals of Anti-Vaccine Tweets for COVID-19 Vaccine with BERT Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been observed to be hypercoagulable, but the mechanisms for this remain poorly described.

These systems need to be simple to operate and maintain, reliable, and resilient to unreliable electrical service. The NEWgenerator (NG) is a compact, automated, solar-powered wastewater treatment system comprised of three major treatment processes: anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), nutrient capture system (NCS) with ion exchange and carbon sorption, and electrochlorination (EC). The NG system operated at an informal settlement community in South Africa over a 534 d period, treating high-strength blackwater (BW) and yellow water (YW) from a public toilet facility. Over three test stages (BW, BW + YW, BW) that included several periods of dormancy, the NG system was able to provide a high level of removal of total suspended solids (97.6  3.1%), chemical oxygen demand (94.5  5.0%), turbidity (96.3  9.7%), color (92.0  10.5%), total nitrogen (82.1  24.0%), total phosphorus (43.0  22.1%), E. coli (7.4  1.5 LRV, not detected in effluent), and helminth ova (not detected in effluent). The treatment levels met most of the ISO 30500 NSSS standard for liquid effluent and local water reuse criteria. A series of maintenance events were successfully conducted onsite over the 534 d field trial: two membrane cleanings, two NCS regenerations, and granular activated carbon replacement. Desludging, a major pain point for onsite sanitation systems, was unnecessary during the field trial and thereby not performed. The AnMBR performed well, removing 94.5  5.0% of the influent COD across all three stages. The high COD removal rate is attributed to the sub-micron separation provided by the ultrafiltration membrane. The NCS was highly efficient at removing total nitrogen, residual COD and color, but the regeneration process was lengthy and is a topic of ongoing research. The EC provided effective disinfection, but frequent prolonged run cycles due to power supply and water quality issues upstream limited the overall system hydraulic throughput. This extended field trial under actual ambient conditions successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced NSSS to address the global water and sanitation crises.","output":"The NEWgenerator(TM) non-sewered sanitation system: Long-term field testing at an informal settlement community in eThekwini municipality, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) energize the COVID-19 pandemic. The B.1.351 variant carrying the escape mutation E484K in the receptor binding domain is of particular concern due to reduced immunological protection following vaccination. Protection can manifest as early as 10 days following immunization with full protection two weeks following the second dose, but the course is not well-characterized for variants. Here, we investigated the immune transcriptome of six elderly individuals (average age 82 yr.) from an old peoples home, who contracted B.1.351, with four having received the first dose of BNT162b eight to 11 days prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patients were hospitalized and received dexamethasone treatment. Immune transcriptomes were established from PBMCs approximately 10 and 35 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptomology. RNA-seq revealed a more intensive immune response in vaccinated patients as compared to unvaccinated ones. Specifically, transcription factors linked to the JAK/STAT pathway, interferon stimulated genes, and genes associated with innate antiviral immunity and COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2 infection were highly enriched in vaccinated patients. This rendered the transcriptomes of the older vaccinated group significantly different than older unvaccinated individuals infected at the same institution and more similar to the immune response of younger unvaccinated individuals (age range 48C62) following B.1.351 infection. All individuals in this study whether vaccinated or not were hospitalized due to B.1.351 infection and one vaccinated patient died illustrating that although an enhanced immune response was documented infection it was insufficient to protect from disease.

The presence of concurrent ipsilateral knee osteoarthritis compounds the issue even further. Although a combined presentation is rare, treatment options to manage each coexisting pathology simultaneously are scarcely reported. We describe the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male who had such a presentation, and was subsequently treated with a one-stage extensor mechanism autograft reconstruction and total knee replacement with computer navigation. CASE: The patient was a 67-year-old male Caucasian, who had previously sustained an acute rupture of his right quadriceps tendon that was adequately repaired 6 months prior. Despite an initial satisfactory result, he reported deterioration in his mobility in the few months thereafter, with worsening knee pain. His comorbidities consisted of hypertension, asthma, and a body mass index of 40.4 kg/m(2). Otherwise, there were no risk factors for tendon rerupture. Clinical examination later revealed a large palpable gap in the right suprapatellar region and weakness of active knee extension. No traumatic cause for this new presentation was identified. Suspicion of a chronic quadriceps tendon rupture was confirmed on radiological imaging, but the investigations also noted the presence of severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the ipsilateral, native knee joint. The combined procedure took place in one surgical sitting. The total knee replacement with patella resurfacing was performed first and assisted by computer navigation. The quadriceps tendon reconstruction was then conducted sequentially using the patients hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis). The tensile strength was reinforced with use of a Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System (LARS) ligament. Initial outcomes were excellent, and these results were maintained at 6 months postoperatively, with the patient reporting no pain and having full range of movement. CONCLUSION: Our techniques used have not previously been reported, but are successful options in treating coexisting chronic quadriceps tendon rupture and ipsilateral knee osteoarthritis. The advantage of using computer navigation with an extramedullary femoral jig can lead to improved accuracy of bone cuts, which is important in the presence of anatomical disruption. Chronic failures of the extensor mechanism require different approaches depending on the inherent and underlying pathology. We feel that the multidisciplinary team approach to the management and use of two surgeons with differing expertise added to the successful outcome of this complex case.","output":"Combined quadriceps tendon reconstruction and total knee replacement with computer navigation: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreatic cancer, at unresectable advanced stages, presents poor prognoses, which could be prevented by early pancreatic cancer diagnosis methods. Recently, a promising early-stage pancreatic cancer biomarker, extracellular vesicles (EVs) related glypican-1 (GPC1) mRNA, is found to overexpress in pancreatic cancer cells. Current mRNA detection methods usually require expensive machinery, strict preservation environments, and time-consuming processes to guarantee detection sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Herein, we propose a novel two-step amplification method (CHAGE) via the target triggered Catalytic Hairpin Assembly strategy combined with Gold-Enhanced point-of-care-testing (POCT) technology for sensitive visual detection of pancreatic cancer biomarker. First, utilizing the catalyzed hairpin DNA circuit, low expression of the GPC1 mRNA was changed into amplification product 1 (AP1, a DNA duplex) as the next detection targets of the paper strips. Second, the AP1 was loaded onto a lateral flow assay and captured with the gold signal nanoparticles to visualize results. Finally, the detected results can be further enhanced by depositing gold to re-enlarge the sizes of gold nanoparticles in detection zones. As a result, the CHAGE methodology lowers the detection limit of mRNA to 100 fM and provides results within 2 h at 37 C. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful application in discriminating pancreatic cancer cells by analyzing EVs GPC1 mRNA expression levels. Hence, the CHAGE methodology proposed here provides a rapid and convenient POCT platform for sensitive detection of mRNAs through unique probes designs (COVID, HPV, etc.).

We evaluated whether patients in a LTLFW had significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared to those in nonconstant-temperature NICU (room temperature). The association of temperature with the prevalence of ABP and A. baumannii isolates (ABI) found in NICU patients was specifically investigated. In vitro microbiological experiments were conducted to measure the proliferation, antibiotic sensitivity, and genomic profiles of A. baumannii (AB) that grew in variable temperatures. MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW had significantly improved outcomes than those in the room temperature NICU. In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria. Consistent with these clinical observations, AB growing at 20C and 25C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance compared to those growing at 35C. The expression of genes related to AB survival ability, drug resistance, and virulence also differed between AB growing at 20C and those at 35C. LTLFW is effective in promoting the recovery of MDR-ABP patients because low temperatures reduced the density and virulence of AB and enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics, likely at the genetic level.

We classified ICA terminus occlusions into 2 groups according to the occlusion pattern of the circle of Willis and hypothesized that clinical outcomes would significantly differ between them. METHODS Consecutive patients with acute ICA terminus occlusions evaluated by baseline computed tomographic angiography were enrolled. We investigated the occlusion patterns in the circle of Willis, retrospectively classified patients into simple ICA terminus occlusion (STO; with good Willisian collaterals from neighboring cerebral circulation) and complex ICA terminus occlusion (CTO; with one or more of A2 anterior cerebral artery, fetal posterior cerebral artery occlusion, or hypoplastic/absent contralateral A1; or with poor collaterals from anterior communicating artery) groups, and compared their baseline characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS The STO group (n=58) showed smaller infarct volumes at 72 hours than the CTO group (n=34) (median, 81 mL [interquartile range, 38-192] vs. 414 mL [193-540], P<0.001) and more favorable outcomes (3-month modified Rankin Scale 0-3, 44.8% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001; 3-month mortality, 24.1% vs. 67.6%, P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, STO remained an independent predictor for favorable outcomes (odds ratio 6.1, P=0.010).

To understand this variability, we compared the transcriptomes of high and low type I IFN producers. METHODS: Blood mononuclear cells from 238 individuals with or without asthma were cultured in the presence or absence of RV. Those samples demonstrating high or low RV\\\\stimulated IFN\\\\ production (N = 75) underwent RNA\\\\sequencing. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns were similar in samples from healthy participants and those with asthma. At baseline, the high IFN\\\\ producer group showed higher expression of genes associated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the innate immune response and vitamin D activation, but lower expression of oxidative stress pathways than the low IFN\\\\ producer group. After RV stimulation, the high IFN\\\\ producer group showed higher expression of genes found in immune response biological pathways and lower expression of genes linked to developmental and catabolic processes when compared to the low IFN\\\\ producer group. CONCLUSIONS: These differences suggest that the high IFN\\\\ group has a higher level of immune system readiness, resulting in a more intense and perhaps more focussed pathogen\\\\specific immune response.

By way of comparison, e-mails were exchanged with a mother and two fathers of autistic children from higher socio-economic backgrounds living in other parts of France or Belgium. While at the beginning of the first lockdown, some children may have felt soothed by being at home with their parents, the extension of the situation led to crises related to feelings of anxiety or boredom. Despite the closure of many medical-social facilities, professionals mobilized to continue helping families and children whose routines were disrupted. CONCLUSION: Depending on the conditions of lockdown, the families experiences differed and evolved over time. The major problems encountered by some families were the worsening of their child's troubles (self-harm, tantrums, violence, and shouting). Pedagogical tools were adapted by the teachers, activity sheets were sent out, group workshops were organized, and consultations were given at a distance. The teams of the child psychiatry services and the medico-social services have mobilized themselves and have shown reactivity and inventiveness in order to ensure the care and follow-up of children and their families.","output":"Vcus de familles denfants autistes en priode de confinement : tude exploratoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by producing various mediators. Although preclinical studies demonstrated that TAMs preferentially express CD163 and CD204, the TAM subsets in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unknown. In this study, we examined the expression and role of TAM subsets in OSCC. Forty-six patients with OSCC were analyzed for expression of TAMs in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We examined TAM subsets and their production of immune suppressive molecules (IL-10 and PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three OSCC patients by flow cytometry. CD163 was detected around the tumor or connective tissue, while CD204 was detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs strongly produced IL-10 and PD-L1 in comparison with CD163(+)CD204(?) and CD163(?)CD204(+) TAMs. Furthermore, the number of activated CD3(+) T cells after co-culture with CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs was significantly lower than that after co-culture with other TAM subsets. In clinical findings, the number of CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs was negatively correlated with that of CD25(+) cells and 5-year progression-free survival. These results suggest that CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs possibly play a key role in the invasion and metastasis of OSCC by T-cell regulation via IL-10 and PD-L1 production.","output":"CD163(+)CD204(+) tumor-associated macrophages contribute to T cell regulation via interleukin-10 and PD-L1 production in oral squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents the usage of a platform for home care providers that integrates telemonitoring functionalities in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Usage of a Web-Based Platform for Home Care Providers in the Pandemic Context."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Patients with severe disease present with hyperinflammation which can affect multiple organs which often include observations of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi.

The demand for arthroplasty is rapidly growing with a corresponding increase in the number of infections involving the prosthesis. The diagnosis and treatment of prosthetic joint infections presents a significant challenge to orthopaedic and infectious diseases clinicians. RECENT FINDINGS The underlying pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infections is due to the ability of the microorganisms to form a biofilm. The biofilm provides protection against host immune responses and antimicrobial therapy. In addition, it impedes standard laboratory diagnostic techniques. This review will examine new investigations to improve the diagnostic yield and rapidity of diagnosis of infections, including the use of sonication to disrupt the biofilm, new molecular tests to improve the detection of infecting microorganisms and new imaging techniques such as (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose PET. SUMMARY The successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections is dependent on eliminating the biofilm dwelling microorganisms whilst maintaining patient mobility and quality of life. This review will examine current understanding of management approaches for these infections, with a particular focus on antimicrobial therapy with activity against the biofilm, such as rifampicin and fluoroquinolones.","output":"Diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an increase in depression and anxiety among those with and without a history of mental illness Commonly used forms of psychological therapy improve mental health by teaching psychotherapeutic strategies that assist people to better manage their symptoms and cope with life stressors Minimal research to date has explored their application or value in managing mental health during significant broad-scale public health crises AIMS: To determine which psychotherapeutic strategies people who have previously received therapy use to manage their distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the use and perceived helpfulness of these strategies has an effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety METHOD: Data (N = 857) was drawn from multiple waves of a representative longitudinal study of the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of Australian adults, which includes measures of anxiety, depression and experiences with psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic strategies RESULTS: Previous engagement in therapy with psychotherapeutic strategies had a protective effect on depressive but not anxiety symptoms Common and helpful strategies used by respondents were exercise, mindfulness and breathing exercises Using mindfulness and perceiving it to be helpful was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms No other strategies were associated with improved mental health CONCLUSIONS: Prior knowledge of psychotherapeutic strategies may play a role in managing mental health during unprecedented public health events such as a global pandemic There may be value in promoting these techniques more widely in the community to manage general distress during such times","output":"Effects of previous exposure to psychotherapeutic strategies on depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) currently poses a global public health threat. Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model and its derivatives predict susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered/deaths) cases but ignore isolation of confirmed cases. Predicting COVID19 trends with hospitalized and infectious people in field separately is important to prepare beds and develop quarantine strategies. Methods: Time-series COVID19 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on delay differential equation was proposed. The model can evaluate patients in hospitals and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new cases, cumulative infections, patients in hospital, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. Its results were compared quantitatively with those of the present isolation model. Results: The basic reproductive number, inferred as 2.30, is a dimensionless parameter composed of modeling parameters. Effects of intervention to mitigate the epidemic spread were assessed a posteriori. An exit policy of how and when to release a statement of emergency was also assessed using the model. Furthermore, results suggest that the rapid isolation of infectious cases has a large potential to effectively mitigate the spread of infection and restores social and economic activities safely. Conclusions: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using COVID19 data for Tokyo. Results show that shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreak without rigorous public health intervention and control. Faster and precise case cluster detection and wider and quicker introduction of testing measures are strongly recommended.","output":"Isolation Considered Epidemiological Model for the Prediction of COVID-19 Trend in Tokyo, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monkeypox is a rare, sometimes life-threatening zoonotic infection that occurs in west and central Africa.

Methods: We conducted a Phase 2, proof of principle, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial, double-blind trial of outpatients with early COVID-19 (within 7 days of symptom onset) at two sites in the United Kingdom. Participants were randomised using a centralised online process to receive: favipiravir (1800mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 400mg four times daily on Days 2-7) plus lopinavir-ritonavir (400mg/100mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200mg/50mg four times daily on Days 2-7); favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir placebo; lopinavir-ritonavir plus favipiravir placebo; or both placebos. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 viral load at Day 5, accounting for baseline viral load. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04499677.

For the favipiravir+lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir+placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo and placebo-only arms, we recruited 61, 59, 60 and 60 participants and analysed 55, 56, 55 and 58 participants respectively who provided viral load measures at Day 1 and Day 5. In the primary analysis, the mean viral load in the favipiravir+placebo arm had decreased by 0.57 log10 (95% CI -1.21 to 0.07, p=0.08) and in the lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo arm by 0.18 log10 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.46, p=0.58) more than in the placebo arm at Day 5. There was no significant interaction between favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir (interaction coefficient term: 0.59 log10, 95% CI -0.32 to 1.50, p=0.20).

Adverse events were observed more frequently with lopinavir-ritonavir, mainly gastrointestinal disturbance. Favipiravir drug levels were lower in the combination arm than the favipiravir monotherapy arm. Interpretation: At the current doses, no treatment significantly reduced viral load in the primary analysis. Favipiravir requires further evaluation with consideration of dose escalation.

Most causes of febrile respiratory illness are bacterial and viral agents of community-acquired pneumonia. However, a small number of rare and highly contagious agents can initially present as febrile respiratory illnesses, which can lead to an epidemic that can greatly impact the health care system. This impact includes sustained mass critical care, with potential scarcity of critical resources (eg, positive-pressure ventilators), spread of disease to health care workers, sustained spread within the community, and extensive morbidity and mortality. The main agents of febrile respiratory illness that would lead to an epidemic include influenza, the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fever, plague, tularemia, and anthrax. Recognition of these agents occurs largely based on epidemiological clues, and management consists of antibiotics, antivirals, supportive care, and positive-pressure ventilation. Acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome occur with these agents, so a lung-protective (low tidal volume) ventilation strategy is indicated. Additional respiratory care measures, such as nebulized medications, bronchoscopy, humidified oxygen, and airway suctioning, potentiate aerosolization of the virus or bacteria and increase the risk of transmission to health care workers and patients. Thus, appropriate personal protective equipment, including an N95 mask or powered air-purifying respirator, is indicated. A basic understanding of the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment of these agents will provide a foundation for early isolation, evaluation, infection control, and public health involvement and response in cases of a febrile respiratory illness that causes respiratory failure.","output":"Severe febrile respiratory illnesses as a cause of mass critical care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To study the organization and practices in nosocomial infection (NI) control in regional and provincial hospitals.

We investigated the impact and clinical effect of treatment of COVID-19 in dialysis patients. METHODS: We included patients on maintenance hemodialysis at different healthcare facilities in Zonguldak city. With the diagnosis of the first infected HD case, all other patients who shared the same session were screened. Hospitalized and clinically confirmed cases were included. COVID-19 diagnosis was made based on clinical, biochemical along radiologic findings. RESULTS: 34 (F/M:19/15, mean age 62  13.2 years, dialysis duration 66.9  57.7 months, length of hospital stay 16.2  7.9 days) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of COVID-19 was found to be 18.4% of our exposed population. 38.2% of our patients were initially diagnosed by CT screening while asymptomatic. 35.3% had a fever as the first presenting symptom. Lymphopenia was the most common laboratory finding. Except for one, all had at least one comorbidity. Out of 12 (35.3%) patients admitted to ICU 6(17.6%) died. The deceased patients were older, presented with lower serum albumin and lymphocyte count, and had higher CRP and fibrinogen levels. High CRP level on admission was the only significant predictor of mortality. CONCLUSION: Early detection will lower mortality. In this study, with a low prevalence of COVID-19, the importance of early screening of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was shown to be highly important. Further studies are still needed to find out the most appropriate medical management.","output":"Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients in the city of Zonguldak, Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS : To elucidate the prognostic role of monocytes in the immune response of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at risk for life-threatening heart and lung injury as major complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS : From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI &#8804;200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI &#8804;200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION : Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.","output":"Numbers and phenotype of non-classical CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are predictors of adverse clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The primary objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of burnout among paediatric residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in France. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with burnout in this population. In a nationwide, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was e-mailed to all paediatric residents in France in the first week of May 2020. The prevalence of burnout was assessed with the validated French-language version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey. The questionnaire also contained items on the residents' sociodemographic characteristics and professional situation. Three hundred and forty paediatric residents completed the questionnaire. The median age was 27 (interquartile range 25-28) and 285 (83.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [79.5-87.6]) of the residents were women. The prevalence of burnout was 37.4%, 95%CI [32.2-42.7]. There was no association between burnout and exposure to the consequences of COVID-19, which may be related to the low incidence of severe COVID-19 among children. In contrast, the hours worked per week and the anxiety scores were significantly associated with burnout.Conclusion: The level of burnout among French paediatric residents is a matter of concern for residents, and cannot be ascribed to the COVID-19 outbreak. Preventive actions should be implemented, with a reduction in working hours and support programs to help manage work-related anxiety. What is Known: a? Burnout is a concern for both residents and the patients they care for. a? Natural disasters disrupt the health care organizations and increase the burnout rate. What is New: a?

Blocking excessive IL-6 production might be the key to the COVID-19-ARDS treatment. Beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade using a humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ) were previously reported in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. The aim of the study was to study the variation over time of several biomarkers, demonstrated to be predictors of poor prognostic, in subjects successfully treated with TCZ for severe COVID-19. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a case series of patients with COVID-19-ARDS, evidenced by RT-PCR and lung CT-scan. Patients with increasing O2 requirements, within the window of opportunity for TCZ treatment (Day 7 to Day 17 after onset of symptoms) were treated with TCZ (2 infusions of 8 mg/kg). Demographic, biological and clinical data were collected from the patients' files. Serum levels of CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, lymphocytes, platelets, creatinine, D-dimer and liver enzymes were assayed at the time of the first TCZ administration, then every two days for 8 days. RESULTS 40 patients were treated with TCZ. Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (lymphopenia, increased CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes). 30 patients (75%) benefited from TCZ and 10 patients died. In the survivors, following TCZ administration CRP decreased dramatically as early as day 4 (-86.7%, p<0.0001) and returned to normal at day 6. Fibrinogen and lymphocyte count returned to normal values at day 6. Ferritin also decreased significantly. No significant change was observed for D-dimer (p=0.68) and other studied biomarkers (haemoglobin, leucocyte count, AST). CONCLUSIONS In patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, treatment with TCZ resulted in favourable evolution in 75% of the cases. Biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen) decreased dramatically as early as the 4th day after TCZ injection. Lymphopenia, a predictor of poor prognostic, was reversed 6 days after TCZ injection.","output":"Biomarker variation in patients successfully treated with tocilizumab for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): results of a multidisciplinary collaboration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: esta comunicao tem como objetivo discutir as Fake News no cenrio brasileiro de COVID-19 Desenvolvimento: no perodo entre 29 de janeiro e 31 de mar?o de 2020, foi realizada uma busca no banco do Ministrio da Sade brasileiro e foram identificadas 70 Fake News sobre o COVID-19, sendo: 40 informaes relacionadas aos discursos de autoridades na sade, 17 sobre teraputica, nove com medidas de preveno, duas referentes aos prognsticos da doen?a e duas de vacinao Conclus?o: a literatura sobre o tema pode ser escassa, no entanto, observa-se que a velocidade de produo de Fake News  relevante, especialmente ao pressupor o impacto social e a capacidade de circulao destas notcias","output":"Fake news no cenrio da pandemia de Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought significant impact onto the maritime activities worldwide, including disruption to global trade and supply chains. The ability to predict the evolution and duration of a COVID-19 outbreak on cargo vessels would inform a more nuanced response to the event and provide a more precise return-to-trade date. A SEIQ(H)R (Susceptibility-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-(Hospitalisation)-Removed/Recovered) model is developed and fit-tested to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 on board cargo vessels of up to 60 crew. Due to specific living and working circumstances on board cargo vessels, instead of utilising the reproduction number, we consider the crew members from the same country to quantify the transmission of the disease. The performance of the model is verified using case studies based on data collected during COVID-19 outbreaks on three cargo vessels in Western Australia during 2020. The convergence between simulation results and the data verifies the performance of the model. The simulations show that the model can forecast the time taken for the transmission dynamics on each vessel to reach their equilibriums, providing informed predictions on the evolution of the outbreak, including hospitalisation rates and duration. The ability to model the evolution of an outbreak, both in duration and severity, is essential to predict outcomes and to plan for the best response strategy.

Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells.

In this article, we report the design and criteria used to validate immunogenicity assays and the outcome of the validation of serologic and functional assays for the evaluation of functional immune response and antibody titers in human serum. A quantitative cell-based microneutralization (MNT) assay, utilizing a reference standard, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-neutralizing antibodies in human serum and Meso Scale Discoverys multiplex electrochemiluminescence (MSD ECL) assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid, and receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins were assessed for precision, accuracy, dilutional linearity, selectivity, and specificity using pooled human serum from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-confirmed recovered donors. Both assays met prespecified acceptance criteria for precision, relative accuracy, dilutional linearity, selectivity, and specificity. Both assays demonstrated high specificity for the different SARS-CoV-2 antigens or virus tested, and no significant cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses. An evaluation to compare the neutralizing activity in the MNT assay to the IgG measured using the MSD ECL assay showed a strong correlation between the presence of neutralizing activity and amount of antibodies against the spike and RBD proteins in sera from both convalescent and vaccinated individuals. Finally, the MNT assay was calibrated to the WHO reference standard to enable reporting of results in international units, thus facilitating comparison of immunogenicity data generated by different assays and/or laboratories. The MSD ECL assay has previously been calibrated. In conclusion, these validated assays for the evaluation of functional immune response and antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could provide a relatively simple standardized approach for accurately comparing immune responses to different vaccines and/or vaccination regimens.","output":"Robust validation and performance comparison of immunogenicity assays assessing IgG and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate the changes in the structural relationship between alienation in physical education (PE) class, school happiness, and future healthy life expectancy in Korean adolescents after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); with a fatality of 7.0 %. Accumulating evidence suggested that the progression of COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and excessive inflammation, and a subset of severe cases might exhibit cytokine storm triggered by secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19. We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.

It contains two hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) regions, denoted HRN and HRC, which oligomerize the S glycoprotein into a trimer in the native state and when activated collapse into a six-helix bundle structure driving fusion of the host and viral membranes. Previous studies have shown that peptides of the HR regions can inhibit viral infectivity. These studies imply that the HR regions are accessible and that agents which can interact with them may prevent viral entry. In the present study, we have investigated an approach to generate antibodies that specifically recognize the HRN and HRC regions of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein in order to evaluate whether these antibodies can inhibit viral infectivity and thus neutralize the SARS-CoV. In this regard, we incorporated HRN and HRC coiled-coil surface residues into a de novo designed two-stranded -helical coiled-coil template for generating conformation-specific antibodies that recognize -helices in proteins (Lu, S.M., Hodges, R.S., 2002. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 23515C23524). Eighteen surface residues from two regions of HRN and HRC were incorporated into the template and used to generate four anti-sera, HRN1, HRN2, HRC1, and HRC2. Our results show that all of the elicited anti-sera can specifically recognize HRN or HRC peptides and the native SARS-CoV S protein in an ELISA format. Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis, however, showed only HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could bind to native S protein expressed on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells, i.e., the cell surface structure of the S glycoprotein precluded the ability of the HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera to see their respective epitope sites. In in vitro viral infectivity assays, no inhibition was observed for either HRN1 or HRN2 anti-serum, whereas both HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could inhibit SARS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HRC1 anti-serum, which was a more effective inhibitor of viral infectivity compared to HRC2 anti-serum, could only bind the pre-fusogenic state of HRC, i.e., the HRC1 anti-serum did not recognize the six-helix bundle conformation (fusion state) whereas HRC2 anti-serum did. These results suggest that antibodies that are more specific for the pre-fusogenic state of HRC may be better neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the two-stranded coiled-coil template acts as an excellent presentation system for eliciting helix-specific antibodies against highly conserved viral antigens and HRC1 and HRC2 peptides may represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV.","output":"Template-based coiled-coil antigens elicit neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination has been recently shown to be impaired in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), but the underlying factors affecting vaccine effectiveness need to be further elucidated.

METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature published in English, spanning from the initial descriptions of COVID-19 until January 25, 2021, in the PubMed/MEDLINE database. RESULTS: We identified 93 new-onset movement disorders cases (44 articles) from 200 papers screened in the database or reference lists. Myoclonus was present in 63.4% (n = 59), ataxia in 38.7% (n = 36), action/postural tremor in 10.8% (n = 10), rigid-akinetic syndrome in 5.38% (n = 5), oculomotor abnormalities in 20.4% (n = 19), catatonia in 2.1% (n = 2), dystonia in 1.1% (n = 1), chorea in 1.1% (n = 1), functional (psychogenic) movement disorders in 3.2% (n = 3) of the reported COVID-19 cases with any movement disorder. Encephalopathy was a common association (n = 37, 39.78%). DISCUSSION: Comprehensive neurophysiological, clinical, and neuroimaging descriptions of movement disorders in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking, and their pathophysiology may be related to inflammatory, postinfectious, or even indirect mechanisms not specific to SARS-CoV-2, such as ischemic-hypoxic brain insults, drug effects, sepsis, kidney failure. Cortical/subcortical myoclonus, which the cited secondary mechanisms can largely cause, seems to be the most common hyperkinetic abnormal movement, and it might occur in association with encephalopathy and ataxia. CONCLUSION: This brief review contributes to the clinical description of SARS-CoV-2 potential neurological manifestations, assisting clinical neurologists in identifying features of these uncommon syndromes as a part of COVID-19 symptomatology. HIGHLIGHTS: C Movement disorders are probably uncommon neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 infection; C Myoclonus is the most reported movement disorder associated with COVID-19, its clinical complications or pharmacological management; C The pathophysiology is yet not well-understood but can include systemic inflammation, autoimmune mechanisms, or hypoxia.","output":"New-Onset Movement Disorders Associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cellCcell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) infection by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Geographic masks are techniques used to protect individual privacy in published maps but are highly under-utilized in research. This leads to continual violations of individual privacy, as sensitive health records are put at risk in unmasked maps. New approaches to geographic masking are required that foster accessibility and ease of use, such that they become more widely adopted. This article describes a new geographic masking method, called street masking, that reduces the burden on users of finding supplemental population data by instead automatically retrieving OpenStreetMap data and using the road network as a basis for masking. We compare it to donut geomasking, both with and without population density taken into account, to evaluate its efficacy against geographic masks that require slightly less and slightly more supplemental data. Our analysis is performed on synthetic data in three different Canadian cities. RESULTS: Street masking performs similarly to population-based donut geomasking with regard to privacy protection, achieving comparable k-anonymity values at similar median displacement distances. As expected, distance-based donut geomasking performs worst at privacy protection. Street masking also performs very well regarding information loss, achieving far better cluster preservation and landcover agreement than population-based donut geomasking. Distance-based donut geomasking performs similarly to street masking, though at the cost of reduced privacy protection. CONCLUSION: Street masking competes with, if not out-performs population-based donut geomasking and does so without requiring any supplemental data from users. Moreover, unlike most other geographic masks, it significantly minimizes the risk of false attribution and inherently takes many geographic barriers into account. It is easily accessible for Python users and provides the foundation for interfaces to be built for non-coding users, such that privacy can be better protected in sensitive geospatial research.","output":"Street masking: a network-based geographic mask for easily protecting geoprivacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19, along with fever and loss of taste and smell. Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain-a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.","output":"Confronting COVID-19-associated cough and the post-COVID syndrome: role of viral neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bicycling leads to the highest number of sport and recreation-related emergency department (ED) visits for traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in the United States (1).

VacA induces apoptotic cell death, which is potentiated by ammonia. VacA also causes cell death by mitochondrial damage, via signaling pathways that are not fully defined. Our aim was to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. We found that C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key signaling protein of ER stress-induced apoptosis, was transcriptionally up-regulated following incubation of gastric epithelial cells with VacA. The effect of VacA on CHOP induction was significantly enhanced by co-incubation with ammonium chloride. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)-alpha, which is known to occur downstream of the ER stress sensor PKR-like ER-localized eIF2-alpha kinase (PERK) and to regulate CHOP expression, was also observed following incubation with VacA in the presence of ammonium chloride. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA resulted in inhibition of VacA-induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that silencing of the PERK gene with siRNA attenuated VacA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha, CHOP induction, expression of BH3-only protein Bim and Bax activation, and cell death induced by VacA with ammonium chloride, indicating that ER stress may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction during VacA-induced toxicity. Activation of ER stress and up-regulation of BH3-only proteins were also observed in human H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa.

METHODS: A cardiac phantom with a simulated PD was imaged under different R using different gamma cameras and reconstruction algorithms. The residual activity from precedent stress administration was simulated by modeling effective half-times in each compartment of the phantom and assuming a delay of 3 hours between the stress and rest studies. The net contrast (NC) of the PD in the rest study was assessed for different R, PD positions and scanner/software combinations. The optimal R will be the one that minimize the NC in the rest images RESULTS: The activity concentration ratio R, the position of the PD and the scanner/software combinations were all main effects with a statistically significant impact on the NC, in decreasing order of relevance. The NC diminished significantly only for R values up to 2. No further improvement was observed for NC for R values above 2 and up to 3.

In vitro data indicate that human resistin directly impairs neutrophil migration and intracellular bacterial killing, although the significance of these findings in vivo remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present study were: (1) to validate the expression of human resistin in a clinically relevant, murine model of surgical sepsis, (2) to assess how sepsis-induced changes in resistin correlate with markers of infection and organ dysfunction, and (3) to investigate whether the expression of human resistin alters immune function or disease outcomes in vivo. METHODS: 107 male, C57BL/6 mice transgenic for the human resistin gene and its promoter elements (Retn+/-/-, or Retn+) were generated on a Retn-/- (mouse resistin knockout, or Rko) background. Outcomes were compared between age-matched transgenic and knockout mice. Acute sepsis was defined as the initial 24 h following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Physiologic and laboratory parameters correlating to the human Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score were measured in mice, and innate immune cell number/function in the blood and peritoneal cavity were assessed. RESULTS: CLP significantly increased circulating levels of human resistin. The severity of sepsis-induced leukopenia was comparable between Retn+ and Rko mice. Resistin was associated with increased production of neutrophil reactive oxygen species, a decrease in circulating neutrophils at 6 h and an increase in peritoneal Ly6Chi monocytes at 6 h and 24 h post-sepsis. However, intraperitoneal bacterial growth, organ dysfunction and mouse survival did not differ with resistin production in septic mice.

Retrospective studies suggested that an elevated D-dimer level is associated with increased mortality and predictive of thrombosis in these patients. In the spring of 2020, our institution developed a risk protocol for stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients into high, intermediate, or low risk groups, based upon history of thrombosis and D-dimer level. These patients were treated with full-dose anticoagulation, high- or standard-dose prophylaxis, respectively. The goal of this project was to determine the impact of this protocol on VTE frequency, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, organ failure and in-hospital mortality while assessing the frequency of hemorrhagic complications when compared to standard prophylactic anticoagulation. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of adults hospitalized between March 1 - June 1, 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients were excluded if they were initially admitted to the ICU. VTE was defined as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on Duplex ultrasound and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography (CT) angiogram. We collected demographic data, medical histories, laboratory and radiologic data on all subjects. Data were analyzed using the Chi Square test and Fisher's Exact Test to establish significant association with clinical outcomes between 3 anticoagulation regimens. Statistical significance was assessed at the p<0.05 level. Results: Data were analyzed from 910 patients; 496 (54.6%) were male and the mean age was 57.8  16.9 years. 419 (46%) subjects were Black, 151 (16.6%) Caucasian, 133 (14.6%) Latinx. Diabetes mellitus (35.3%) and hypertension (59.8%) were common in our cohort as were tobacco (12.6%) and alcohol (20.4%) use. Only 69 (7.6%) were treated with chronic anticoagulation and 216 (23.7%) were on antiplatelet agents. 123 (13.5%) required an ICU transfer and the overall mortality was 5.3%. Most patients, 809 (88.9%), received standard prophylactic anti-coagulation initially (Group A); 32 (3.5%) received high dose prophylaxis (Group B) and 69 (7.6%) received therapeutic dose anticoagulation (Group C). In the entire cohort, 46 (5.1%) developed VTE; 29 (3.6%) in Group A, 2 (6.3%) in Group B, and 15 (22%) in Group C (p<0.0001). ICU admission was required for 102 (12.6%) in Group A, 7 (21.9%) in Group B, and 14 (20.3%) in Group C (p=0.075). 73 ICU patients (8%) required vasopressors, including 57 (7%) in Group A, 6 (18.8%) in Group B and 10 (14.5%) in Group C (p=0.175). 81 ICU patients (8.9%) required mechanical ventilation, including 66 (8.2%) in Group A, 6 (18.8%) in Group B, and 9 (13%) in Group C (p=0.513). One patient in Group B developed an intracerebral hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 11 (1.2%) of the cohort; similar rates were observed across treatment arms. The overall in-hospital mortality was 5.3% in this cohort (4.7% in Group A, 12.5% in Group B, and 8.6% in Group C, p=0.064). Conclusion: The rate of VTE in COVID-19 patients receiving any form of anti-coagulation was low. There was an increased rate of VTE, but not rates of ICU admission, mortality, mechanical ventilation nor vasopressor use in those receiving either high dose prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation, suggesting an increased propensity for thrombosis either related to prior thrombotic events or reflected by increased D-dimer levels. These findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies.

Some in-silico analyses have been performed to predict the impact of these proteins on viral entry, replication, and complications. These proteins have shown a high potency in sialic acid hydrolysis from the lung cells (WI-38) surface. Docking analysis showed that these proteins have a high binding affinity to viral receptor-binding sites in the receptor-binding domain, causing attachment prevention. Moreover, MRJPs can exert an inhibitory influence, via different mechanisms, for SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (main and papain proteases, RNA replicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferase). Also, they can bind to hemoglobin-binding sites on viral-nsps and prevent their hemoglobin attack.

Identity is a complex entity that can be conceptualised as externally influenced, but individually constructed. Integration from legitimate bystander to old timer of the medical community of practice provides a backdrop for individual negotiation of professional identity. During Covid-19, the medical community of practice and education experienced significant disruption. We sought to investigate how these disruptions impacted professional identity development by examining conflicts between students identities highlighted by the pressures of the pandemic. ApproachA mixed-methods survey was distributed to medical students in the UK. The survey was active from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, during the height of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. Operating within the paradigm of constructivism, we conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative responses. Analysis was focused around the disruption to medical education, actions taken by medical students during this disruption, and the tension between student actions where they existed in conflict. FindingsThree themes were constructed to describe the identities that participants felt were in conflict during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic: Status and role as a future doctor; status and role as a student; and status and role as a member of the wider community. Students noted that lack of clinical exposure was detrimental to their education, implicitly recognising that many aspects of professional identity formation are forged in the clinical environment. Participants were keen to volunteer clinically but struggled to balance this with academic work. Participants worried about the risk to their families and the wider community, and wanted to ensure that their skills would add value to the clinical environment. Volunteers felt frustrated when they were unable to perform tasks which aligned with their identities as future doctors, with the exception of participants who worked as interim FY1s (FiY1s), which aligned well with the roles of FY1s. InsightsAs hypothesised, the participants in this study experienced disruptions to their professional identity development during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This work provides early evidence, collected at the beginning of the pandemic, that the effects of disruptions to professional identity development were wide-reaching, often negative, and represent an important topic for future exploration. Given that the pandemic has highlighted areas of identity tension, these findings have the potential to provide insight into how medical training can better nurture professional identity development during and beyond international crises.","output":"'I don't feel like I'm learning how to be a doctor': early insights regarding the impact of Covid-19 on UK medical student professional identity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is crucial to understand how to promote workforce resilience to a crisis such as the COVID-19 outbreak The main aim of this study is to examine the role of workers' core beliefs challenge in fostering their resilience Core beliefs challenge is the constructive rebuilding of an individual's fundamental assumptions about life, the world, the self and others The data were collected from 672 tourism employees during the pandemic crisis The results revealed the positive association between workers' core beliefs challenge and their resilience Cognitive reappraisal was detected as a mediator for the relationship between core beliefs challenge and resilience, while evidence was not found for the mediating role of expressive suppression for such a relationship Family strain negatively moderated the links between core beliefs challenge and both emotion regulation strategies Discussions on theoretical and practical implications are displayed","output":"Worker resilience during the COVID-19 crisis: The role of core beliefs challenge, emotion regulation, and family strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider network autoregressive models for count data with a non-random neighborhood structure.

The patient is positioned in a \\"corkscrew\\" configuration with the abdomen supine and the chest rotated to the left to allow access to the right chest. The abdomen and chest are prepped into a single operative field. This technique allows sequential access to the abdomen for gastric mobilization, chest for division of the esophagus, abdomen for construction of the gastric conduit, and chest for intrathoracic anastomosis.

However, since January 2015, the first report of CPV-2c in a puppy has occurred in Taiwan. There is currently limited information about the CPV-2c variant in Taiwan. In the present study, we characterized the previously unidentified CPV-2c variant and investigated the distribution of CPV-2 variants in Taiwan. METHODS: During January 2014 to April 2016, fecal or rectal swab samples from 99 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection in Taiwan were collected. Eighty-eight were identified as being either CPV-2a, ?2b or -2c variants positive by real-time PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the 88 isolates confirmed CPV-2c as the dominant variant (54.6 %), followed by CPV-2b (26.1 %) and CPV-2a (19.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent CPV-2c variants are similar to the Chinese CPV-2c strain but can be considered as novel Asian CPV-2c isolates.

Here, we intended to assess the CARs diagnostic power in early differentiation of hospitalized severe COVID-19 cases. In this retrospectively designed study, we evaluated 197 patients in total. They were divided into two groups based on their severity of COVID-19 as non-severe (n = 113) and severe (n = 84). The comparison of groups demographic data, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and laboratory test results were done. Laboratory data of the patients within the first 24 h after admission to the hospital were evaluated. The calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic power of CAR in differentiating severity of COVID-19. Independent risk factors predictive of COVID-19 severity were determined by using logistic regression analysis. Although lymphocyte count levels were lower, severe COVID-19 patients had higher mean age, higher levels of neutrophil count, CRP, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ferritin, and prothrombin time (P < 0.05). Compared with non-severe patients (median, 0.23 [IQR = 0.07C1.56]), patients with severe COVID-19 had higher CAR levels (median, 1.66 [IQR = 0.50C3.35]; P < 0.001). Age (OR = 1.046, P = 0.003), CAR (OR = 1.264, P = 0.037), and AST (OR = 1.029, P = 0.037) were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis. ROC curve analysis assigned 0.9 as the cut-off value for CAR for differentiation of severe COVID-19 (area under the curve = 0.718, 69.1% sensitivity, 70.8% specificity, P < 0.001).

The scale consists of 42 items and permits the calculation of the scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-21, the BDI 13, the Melancholia Subscale, the Asthenia Subscale, the Anxiety Subscale and the Mania Subscale METHODS 29 depressed patients 30.48 +/- 9.83 years old, and 120 normal controls 27.45 +/- 10.85 years old entered the study. In 20 of them (8 patients and 12 controls) the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. Clinical Diagnosis was reached by consensus of two examiners with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. CES-D and ZDRS were used for cross-validation purposes. The Statistical Analysis included ANOVA, the Spearman Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The optimal cut-off points were: BDI-21: 14/15, BDI-13: 7/8, Melancholia: 8/9, Asthenia: 9/10, Anxiety: 10/11. Chronbach's alpha ranged between 0.86 and 0.92 for individual scales. Only the Mania subscale had very low alpha (0.12). The test-retest reliability was excellent for all scales with Spearman's Rho between 0.79 and 0.91.

In South Africa, we observe that the prevalence of COVID-19 in December (with strong presence of Omicron) among the unvaccinated population is comparable to the prevalence during the previous wave (in August-September), in which Delta was the variant with the largest presence. However, among vaccinated, the prevalence of COVID-19 in December is much higher than in the previous wave. In fact, a significant reduction of the vaccine efficacy is observed from August-September to December. For instance, the efficacy drops from 0.81 to 0.30 for those vaccinated with 2 doses, and from 0.51 to 0.09 for those vaccinated with one dose. The study is then extended to other countries in which Omicron has been detected, comparing the situation in October (before Omicron) with that of December. While the reduction measured is smaller than in South Africa, we still found, for instance, an average drop in vaccine efficacy from 0.53 to 0.45 among those vaccinated with two doses.

Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described. Results: Of 124 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 8 (6.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 64.3 +/- 6.5 years, 5 (62.5%) male, mean time from last-normal was 4.8 days [SD 4.8], and none received acute reperfusion therapy. All 8 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic; 3 were explained by atrial fibrillation while 5 (62.5%) were cryptogenic. In contrast, cryptogenic strokes were seen in 20 (16.1%) of 124 total stroke admissions during this time. Conclusions: In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors with an age of stroke presentation typically seen in non-COVID populations. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes and with a prolonged median time to presentation/symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for aggressive identification and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Characteristics of Ischemic Stroke in COVID-19: A Need for Early Detection and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, most of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the relations between images and consider each input image independently. Intuitively, relations between images can help to understand the images and maintain model consistency over related images, leading to better explainability. In this paper, we consider modeling the image-level relations to generate more informative image representations, and propose ImageGCN, an end-to-end graph convolutional network framework for inductive multi-relational image modeling. We apply ImageGCN to chest X-ray images where rich relational information is available for disease identification. Unlike previous image representation models, ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original pixel features and its relationship with other images. Besides learning informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for object detection in a weakly supervised manner. The experimental results on 3 open-source x-ray datasets, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate that ImageGCN can outperform respective baselines in both disease identification and localization tasks and can achieve comparable and often better results than the state-of-the-art methods.","output":"ImageGCN: Multi-Relational Image Graph Convolutional Networks for Disease Identification with Chest X-rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS This article examines the reasons for partial and complete refusal of childhood vaccination as reported by parents in Finland. It analyzes perceptions and experiences central in vaccination decisions. METHODS The analysis is based on 38 in-depth interviews with Finnish parents who have refused all or several vaccines for their children. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Three categories of reasons were identified in the analysis: 1) risks and effects of vaccination - concern about and/or experiences of possible side-effects was the most important reason for avoiding vaccines; 2) distrust - participants did not trust vaccination recommendations made by health officials and medical professionals due to perceived bias in medical research, ties between health officials and the pharmaceutical industry, and personal experiences of (suspected) adverse effects and the way these concerns were received in healthcare institutions; 3) health perceptions and practices - parents supported their vaccination choices with complementary and alternative medicine treatments and alternative health understandings. Many stated that contracting vaccine-preventable illnesses would provide longer lasting and more 'natural' immunity than vaccination, and possibly other health benefits. CONCLUSIONS A loss of trust in medical and public health actors was central to the process in which parents came to question, contest, and eventually refuse childhood vaccination. The adverse effects of the Pandemrix vaccine in 2009-2010 have been important in leading to distrust and contestation. Distrust may relate to personal experiences of (suspected) adverse effects or to broader concerns over the neutrality of health authorities and the trustworthiness of medical research.","output":"Why do parents refuse childhood vaccination?

Design/methodology/approach Technology acceptance model (TAM) is incorporated to study the adoption of mobile learning by university students. Quantitative research technique is used as core research approach in this study. Structural equation modelling (SEM), which is a part of quantitative research method, was employed on the congregated data via a set of questionnaire from 268 University students. SEM is used to explore the relationships among the hypothesized constructs. SPSS and AMOS software were used for the analysis of data. Findings This study validated the updated TAM model and assessed the students' adoption of mobile technologies for m-learning during COVID-19. All the constructs of proposed model were found to be significant with more than 50% average variance extracted. It was found that two external constructs mobile system efficacy and mobile service efficacy appended in technology acceptance model show the direct positive effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use constructs. However, hypothesized relationships were found to be unsupported among perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Furthermore, perceived usefulness and ease of use during m-learning impact the students' usage attitude which consequently impact the students' adoption behaviour towards adoption of mobile technology.

Does the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue depend on the amount of work done (W') at task failure when cycling above critical power (CP)? What is the main finding and its importance? Creatine supplementation increases W' and enhances supra-CP performance, but induces similar magnitudes of neuromuscular fatigue at task failure compared to placebo. Increased W' does not lead to higher levels of neuromuscular fatigue. This supports the notion of a critical level of neuromuscular fatigue at task failure and challenges a direct causative link between W' depletion and neuromuscular fatigue. ABSTRACT The present study examined the effect of creatine supplementation on neuromuscular fatigue and exercise tolerance when cycling above critical power (CP). Eleven males performed an incremental cycling test, 4-5 constant-load trials to task failure (TTF) to obtain asymptote (CP) and curvature constant (W') of the power-duration relationship, followed by three constant-load supra-CP trials: 1) one TTF following placebo supplementation (PLA); 2) one TTF following creatine supplementation (CRE); and 3) one trial of equal duration to PLA following creatine supplementation (ISO). Neuromuscular assessment of the right knee extensors was performed pre- and post-exercise to measure maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), twitch forces evoked by single (Qpot ) and paired high- (PS100) and low-frequency (PS10) stimulations and voluntary activation. Creatine supplementation increased TTF in CRE vs. PLA by 11% (P = 0.017) and work done above CP by 10% (P = 0.015), with no difference (P > 0.05) in reductions in MVC (-24  8 vs. -20  9%), Qpot (-39  13 vs. -32  14%), PS10 (-42  14 vs. -36  13%), PS100 (-25  10 vs. -18  12%) and voluntary activation (-7  8 vs. -5  7%) in CRE vs. PLA. No significant difference were found between ISO and both PLA and CRE (P > 0.05). These findings suggest similar levels of neuromuscular fatigue can be found following supra-CP cycling despite increases in performance time and amount of work done above CP, supporting the notion of a critical level of neuromuscular fatigue and challenging a direct causative link between W' depletion and neuromuscular fatigue.

METHODS Bilateral resting and active motor thresholds (RMT, AMT) were gathered using transcranial magnetic stimulation among 82 MS patients. Corticospinal excitability (CSE) asymmetry was expressed as the ratio between weaker and stronger sides' RMT and AMT. Stronger and weaker side was determined by pinch and grip strength. We examined whether CSE asymmetry predicted symptoms. RESULTS AMT asymmetry ratio revealed atypical CSE asymmetry whereby the hemisphere associated with the weaker hand was more excitable in early MS. After controlling for MS disease demographics, shifting of CSE asymmetry towards greater excitability in the stronger side significantly predicted more severe symptoms including Expanded Disease Severity Scale, nine-hole peg test, cognitive processing speed, walking speed, heat sensitivity, fatigue, and subjective impact of MS. CONCLUSION CSE asymmetry significantly predicted the severity of MS-related physical and objective cognitive symptoms. The phenomenon may be related to neuroinflammation-mediated hyperexcitability. Shifting of asymmetry toward less excitability on the weaker side may suggest the onset of a more neurodegenerative phase of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE Shifting of hemispheric excitability, detected using a CSE asymmetry ratio, may be a useful biomarker to track disease progression and understand the benefits of treatments.","output":"Asymmetry of Brain Excitability: A New Biomarker that Predicts Objective and Subjective Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racially and ethnically diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have historically been disproportionately affected by disasters and public health emergencies in the United States.

METHODS Clinical and imaging data of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 69 with other types of viral pneumonia were retrospectively studied. All significant imaging features (Youden index >0.3) were included for constituting the combined criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, composed of two or more imaging features with a parallel model. McNemar's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the validity indices (sensitivity and specificity) among various criteria. RESULTS Ground glass opacities (GGO) dominated density, peripheral distribution, unilateral lung, clear margin of lesion, rounded morphology, long axis parallel to the pleura, vascular thickening, and crazy-paving pattern were more common in COVID-19 (p <0.05). Consolidation-dominated density, both central and peripheral distribution, bilateral lung, indistinct margin of lesion, tree-in-bud pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenectasis, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening were more common in other types of viral pneumonia (p < 0.05). GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura (with the highest sensitivity), and GGO-dominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura or vascular thickening (with the highest specificity) are good combined criteria of COVID-19.

Nevertheless, the study of single live bacteria in their aqueous environment has long remained a big challenge, due to the strong infrared absorption of water and the small size of bacteria compared to the micron-range infrared wavelengths of the probing photons. To record infrared spectra of bacteria in an aqueous environment, at different spatial resolutions, two setups were developed. A custom-built attenuated total reflection inverted microscope was coupled to a synchrotron-based FTIR spectrometer, using a germanium hemisphere. With such a setup, a projected spot size of 1  1 m2 was achieved, which allowed spectral acquisition at the single-cell level in the 1800-1300 cm-1 region. The second setup used a demountable liquid micro-chamber with a thermal source-powered FTIR microscope, in transmission geometry, for probing clusters of a few thousands of live cells in the mid-IR region (4000-975 cm-1). Both setups were applied for studying two strains of a model lactic acid bacterium exhibiting different cryo-resistances. The two approaches allowed the discrimination of both strains and revealed population heterogeneity among bacteria at different spatial resolutions. The multivariate analysis of spectra indicated that the cryo-sensitive cells presented the highest cell heterogeneity and the highest content of proteins with the -helix structure.

Changes in vitamin D 25(OH)D levels will be assessed and their relation to study outcomes will be explored. Conclusions The proposed pragmatic trial will allow parallel testing of vitamin D3 supplementation for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The household cluster design provides a cost-efficient approach to testing an intervention for reducing rates of hospitalization and/or mortality in newly diagnosed cases and preventing infection among their close household contacts.","output":"The vitamin D for COVID-19 (VIVID) trial: A pragmatic cluster-randomized design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When vaccine supply is limited but population immunisation urgent, the allocation of the available doses needs to be carefully considered. One aspect of dose allocation is the time interval between the primer and the booster injections in two-dose vaccines. By stretching this interval, more individuals can be vaccinated with the first dose more quickly. Even if the level of immunity of these 'half-vaccinated' individuals is lower than that of those who have received both shots, delaying the second injection can be beneficial in reducing case numbers, provided a single dose is sufficiently effective. On the other hand, there has been concern that intermediate levels of immunity in partially vaccinated individuals may favour the evolution of vaccine escape mutants. In that case, a large fraction of half-vaccinated individuals would pose a risk - but only if they encounter the virus. This raises the question whether there is a conflict between reducing the burden and the risk of vaccine escape evolution or not. We develop a minimal model to assess the population-level effects of the timing of the booster dose. We set up an SIR-type model, in which more and more individuals become vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine over the course of a pandemic. As expected, there is no trade-off when vaccine escape evolves at equal probabilities in unvaccinated and half-vaccinated patients. If vaccine escape evolves more easily in half-vaccinated patients, the presence or absence of a trade-off depends on the reductions in susceptibility and transmissibility elicited by the primer dose.","output":"Vaccination strategies when vaccines are scarce: On conflicts between reducing the burden and avoiding the evolution of escape mutants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the arrival of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil in February 2020, several preventive measures were taken by the population aiming to avoid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection including the use of masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing then, these measures may have contributed to preventing infection also by other respiratory viruses. Our goal was to determine the frequencies of Influenza A and B viruses (FLUAV/FLUBV), human mastadenovirus C (HAdV-C), Enterovirus 68 (EV-68), and rhinovirus (RV) besides SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients suspect of COVID-19 with cases of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) in the period of March to December 2020 and to detect possible coinfections among them. Nucleic acid detection was performed using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in respiratory samples using naso-oropharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage. A total of 418 samples of the 987 analyzed (42.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 16 (1.62%) samples were positive for FLUAV, no sample was positive for FLUBV or EV-68, 67 (6.78%) samples were positive for HAdV-C, 55 samples were positive for RV 1/2 (26.3%) and 37 for RV 2/2 (13.6%). Coinfections were also detected, including a triple coinfection with SARS-CoV-2, FLUAV, and HAdV-C. In the present work, a very low frequency of FLUV was reported among hospitalized patients with ARDS compared to the past years, probably due to preventive measures taken to avoid COVID-19 and the high influenza vaccination coverage in the region in which this study was performed.","output":"Low circulation of Influenza A and coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 among other respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic in a region of southern Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antiviral activity of nonfunctionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) in vitro was revealed in this study.

Artemisinin-induced dormancy, shown in vitro and in animal models, provides a plausible explanation. To date, direct evidence of artemisinin-induced dormancy in humans is lacking. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7- or K13-infected participants before and 48-72 hours after single dose artesunate (AS) treatment. Parasite morphology, molecular signature of dormancy, capability and dynamics of seeding in vitro cultures, and genetic mutations in the K13 gene were investigated. RESULTS: Dormant parasites were observed in post-AS blood samples of 3D7- and K13-infected participants. The molecular signature of dormancy, an up-regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, was detected in 3D7 and K13 samples post-AS, but not in pre-AS samples. Post-treatment samples successfully seeded in vitro cultures, with a significant delay in time to reach 2% parasitemia compared to pre-treatment samples. CONCLUSION: This study provides strong evidence for the presence of artemisinin-induced dormant parasites in P. falciparum infections. These parasites are a likely reservoir for recrudescent infection following artemisinin monotherapy and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). Combination regimens that target dormant parasites or remain at therapeutic levels for a sufficient time to kill recovering parasites will likely improve efficacy of ACTs.","output":"Dormant Plasmodium falciparum parasites in human infections following artesunate therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We report an unusual clinical case in a pet rabbit vaccinated against rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV, GI.1), that developed a prolonged hepatic disease, and was diagnosed RHDV2 (GI.2) positive post-mortem. This finding is a warning to all veterinarians that rabbit haemorrhagic disease should also be considered for differential diagnosis despite the history of RHDV vaccination and the need to update vaccination programs against the current RHDV2 circulating strains. ABSTRACT: Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious infectious disease of European wild and domestic rabbits. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV, GI.1) emerged in 1986 in Europe, rapidly spreading all over the world. Several genotypes of RHDV have been recognised over time, but in 2010, a new virus (RHDV2/RHDVb, GI.2) emerged and progressively replaced the previous RHDV strains, due to the lack of cross-immunity conferred between RHDV and RHDV2. RHDV2 has a high mutation rate, similarly to the other calivirus and recombines with strains of RHDV and non-pathogenic calicivirus (GI.4), ensuring the continuous emergence of new field strains. Although this poses a threat to the already endangered European rabbit species, the available vaccines against RHDV2 and the compliance of biosafety measures seem to be controlling the infection in the rabbit industry Pet rabbits, especially when kept indoor, are considered at lower risk of infections, although RHDV2 and myxoma virus (MYXV) constitute a permanent threat due to transmission via insects. Vaccination against these viruses is therefore recommended every 6 months (myxomatosis) or annually (rabbit haemorrhagic disease). The combined immunization for myxomatosis and RHDV through a commercially available bivalent vaccine with RHDV antigen has been extensively used (Nobivac(?) Myxo-RHD, MSD, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). This vaccine however does not confer proper protection against the RHDV2, thus the need for a rabbit clinical vaccination protocol update. Here we report a clinical case of hepatitis and alteration of coagulation in a pet rabbit that had been vaccinated with the commercially available bivalent vaccine against RHDV and tested positive to RHDV2 after death. The animal developed a prolonged and atypical disease, compatible with RHD. The virus was identified to be an RHDV2 recombinant strain, with the structural backbone of RHDV2 (GI.2) and the non-structural genes of non-pathogenic-A1 strains (RCV-A1, GI.4). Although confirmation of the etiological agent was only made after death, the clinical signs and analytic data were very suggestive of RHD.","output":"A Potential Atypical Case of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease in a Dwarf Rabbit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the current research is mainly to investigate socio-economic indicators that affect the health status of the elderly.

We found that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2 and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on Fc?3RII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher pro-inflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients.

APPROACH & RESULTS Patients who were listed with MELD>25 from 2008-2017 were analyzed with intention-to-treat(ITT) basis retrospectively. Patients who had a potential live donor were analyzed as ITT-LDLT whereas those who had none belonged to ITT-deceased donor liver transplantation(ITT-DDLT)group. ITT-overall survival(ITT-OS) was analyzed from the time of listing. 325 patients were listed(ITT-LDLT n=212, ITT-DDLT n=113). The risk of delist/death was lower in the ITT-LDLT group(43.4% vs. 19.8%,P<0.001)while transplant rate was higher in the ITT-LDLT group(78.3% vs. 52.2%,P<0.001). The 5-year ITT-OS were superior in the ITT-LDLT group(72.6% vs. 49.5%,P<0.001) for MELD>25, and for MELD>25 and HRS patients(56% vs. 33.8%,P<0.001). Waitlist mortality was the highest early after listing and the distinct alteration of slope at survival curve showed that the benefits of ITT-LDLT occurred within the first month after listing. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year patient survival were comparable for MELD>25(88% vs. 85.4%,P=0.279) and MELD>25 and HRS patients(77% vs. 76.4%,P=0.701) after LDLT and DDLT respectively.

ITT-LDLT reduced the hazard of mortality(HR=0.387-0.552)across all MELD strata. CONCLUSIONS The ITT-LDLT reduced waitlist mortality and allowed an earlier access to transplant. LDLT in high MELD/HRS patients were feasible, they had similar perioperative outcomes and better renal recovery, while the long-term survival and eGFR were comparable to DDLT.

The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein.

The most important treatment options are nitroimidazole derivatives, such as nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). Some studies suggest that for adults seropositive to T. cruzi but without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a simple fixed-dose scheme of BZN could be equivalent to a weight-adjusted dose. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of BZN with an adjusted dose for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We used the Cochrane methods, and reported according to the PRISMA statement. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to fixed and/or adjusted doses of BZN for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We searched (December 2019) Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and contacted Chagas experts. Selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane tool, were performed independently by pairs of reviewers. Discrepancies were solved by consensus within the team. Primary outcomes were parasite-related outcomes and efficacy or patient-related safety outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software and used GRADE summary of finding tables to present the certainty of evidence by outcome. We identified 655 records through our search strategy and 10 studies (four of them ongoing) met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any study directly comparing fixed vs adjusted doses of BZN, however, some outcomes allowed subgroup comparisons between fixed and adjusted doses of BZN against placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests no important subgroup differences for positive PCR at one year and for three safety outcomes (drug discontinuation, peripheral neuropathy, and mild rash). The same effect was observed for any serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). All subgroups showed similar effects (I2 0% for all these subgroup comparisons but 32% for peripheral neuropathy), supporting the equivalence of BZN schemes. We conclude that there is no direct evidence comparing fixed and adjusted doses of BZN. Based on low to very low certainty of evidence for critical clinical outcomes and moderate certainty of evidence for important outcomes, fixed and adjusted doses may be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy.

The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer peoples needs. Drones are providing users with a birds eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle.

The big data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University were used to assess the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The infection data in the early phase of the pandemic from six countries in each of six geographic zones divided according to the WHO were used, representing approximately 5.4 billion people around the globe. We calculated the infection growth factor, doubling times of infection and death cases, reproductive number and infection and death cases in relation to the blood type distribution. The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (<30%), the higher blood type A population (a30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics.

Without prior notice, they had to switch from traditional education to virtual teaching. This study's objective was to identify the perception of students and professors of the Bachelor in the English Language from the University of Chihuahua, Mexico, during the transition to virtual classes due to the pandemic. Researchers applied a survey of 28 items with a Likert scale to 152 students during the spring semester 2020 and the second instrument of 51 items to 26 professors. The students reported having complications in connectivity (21%) and difficulties interacting with professors and classmates (34%). Many students reported experiencing anxiety (69.1%) and feeling isolated (62.5%). Most agree that they learn better in face-to-face classes (85%). In turn, the professors agree that the students had a lower performance than in a face-to-face semester (69.3%). Despite this, the professors affirm that they followed the program to the letter (92.3%) and completed the programmed contents (84.6%). Besides, 92.3% of the academics are confident to face a new semester in virtual modality, if necessary. Although we can say that the transition from face-to-face to virtual classes in the institution was successful, students and professors encountered difficulties and disadvantages in the use of platforms for online classes. The benefit of this research's findings is understanding the University must have all the necessary elements in place for online teaching. It must establish a formal regulation of virtual programs that includes professor's and student's profile, as well as the strategies to be followed. The students' and professors' perceptions highlight the crucial elements that professors need to consider to teach virtual classes and take advantage of these lessons to face the future better. ? 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with hypertension were included in this exploratory study. Accelerometer-based PA and SB measures were assessed before and during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Housing type, housing surface area and household size were tested as predictors of changes in PA and SB. A generalized linear mixed model was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Housing type was associated with changes in PA and SB. Individuals residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on weekdays (?= -65 min/day, p=0.035) and a trend for an increase in SB (?= 55 min/day, p=0.056) compared to those residing in a detached house. Individuals residing in a row house showed a greater decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (?= -10 min/day, p=0.037) and steps/day (?= -2064, p=0.010) compared to those residing in a detached house. Individuals residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on the weekends (?= -83 min/day, p=0.015) and an increase in SB (?= 72 min/day, p=0.036) compared to those residing in a detached house. No association was found for housing surface area and household size.

Preventing infection at local sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development. However, stimulating mucosal immunity is often challenging. Particulate adjuvants that can specifically target mucosal immune cells offer a promising opportunity to stimulate local immunity at the nasal and/or pulmonary mucosal surfaces. AREAS COVERED This review analyzes the common causes of respiratory infections, the challenges in the induction of mucosal and systemic responses and current pulmonary and nasal mucosal vaccination strategies. The ability of various particulate adjuvant formulations, including lipid-based particles, polymers and other particulate systems, to be effectively utilized for mucosal vaccine delivery is discussed. EXPERT OPINION Induction of antibody and cell-mediated mucosal immunity that can effectively combat respiratory pathogens remains a challenge. Particulate delivery systems can be developed to target mucosal immune cells and effectively present antigen to evoke a rapid and long-term local immunity in the respiratory mucosa. In particular, particulate delivery systems offer the versatility of being formulated with multiple adjuvants and antigenic cargo, and can be tailored to effectively prime immune responses across the mucosal barrier.

Specific-pathogen-free and conventional poults were orally challenged with SRV and/or turkey coronavirus and monitored for clinical signs. Intestines, thymus, bursa, and spleens were examined for SRV antigen at various days postinoculation (DPI). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), thymocytes, and splenic lymphocytes from inoculated poults or lymphocytes isolated from healthy poults after incubation with SRV in vitro were examined for lymphoproliferative potential against concanavalin A (Con A). The incidence of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood and thymic lymphocytes of SRV-challenged poults was examined by flow cytometry. The results of these studies showed that the SRV challenge induced diarrhea, growth suppression, and atrophy of thymus and bursa resembling those of PEMS in field and/or experimental infections. The SRV antigen was detected in intestinal tissues soon after infection (i.e., at 2 and 4 DPI), whereas lymphoid tissues such as thymus, bursa, and spleen were positive for SRV antigen starting at 4 DPI until 8 DPI, suggesting virus translocation to lymphoid organs. The responsiveness of PBLs to Con A at 2 DPI was significantly reduced in all virus challenge groups (e.g., 28% and 22% in the SRV-alone group in studies 1 and 2, respectively) below the uninfected group. However, this suppressed response was no longer evident in the SRV group by 7 DPI. The SRV incubation with normal thymocytes and splenocytes in vitro resulted in significantly reduced lymphoproliferative response against Con A (41.2% and 10.49% reductions at 1:50 SRV dilution vs. controls in thymocytes and splenocytes, respectively). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sudden decline at 2 DPI in the numbers of CD4- CD8+ lymphocyte subset in PBLs of SRV-infected poults. However, by 8 DPI, SRV-challenged poults had relatively higher CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes in PBLs. On the contrary, thymocytes had higher percentages of CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes at 2 and 4 DPI and reached comparable levels at 8 DPI in controls and SRV-infected poults. No differences were observed in CD4+ CD8- lymphocyte numbers in controls vs. SRV-infected poults. The findings of these studies imply that SRV may be a promising primary etiologic agent of PEMS. Furthermore, the SRV infection may compromise the lymphocyte-mediated immune defenses by reducing lymphoproliferation and the CD4- CD8+ (presumably T-cytotoxic cells) lymphocytes during the acute stage of SRV infection.","output":"A novel \\"small round virus\\" inducing poult enteritis and mortality syndrome and associated immune alterations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism is a sector that employs a significant amount of labor, but thanks to the pandemic generated by COVID-19 it is a sector that is now among the most threatened The consequences will affect the most vulnerable groups This situation has invited to rethink about the best options for the reactivation of the activity The fear of mass tourism has made people look towards community tourism, the contemplative and nature tourism, where the gathering of people is limited to small groups It is necessary to mitigate the negative impact on the inhabitants of the destination, thus strengthening the development of a 5 0 tourism that takes care of society and its quality of life, through the identification of specialized niches, under a context awareness framework This document presents the approaches to tourism planning, a comparison of different models that measure aspects of quality of life for populations and the proposal for the use of expert systems for tourism actors: the tourist, the host and the government ? 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao All rights reserved","output":"Tourism 5.0: A contribution to the identification of specialized niches from context awareness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: We propose a mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic preserving an optimal balance between the adequate description of a pandemic by SIR model and simplicity of practical estimates As base model equations, we derive two-parameter nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations with retarded time argument, applicable to any community (country, city, etc ) The presented examples of modeling the pandemic development depending on two parameters: the time of possible dissemination of infection by one virus carrier and the probability of contamination of a healthy population member in a contact with an infected one per unit time, e g , a day, is in qualitative agreement with the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic The proposed model is compared with the SIR model ? 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd","output":"Reduced SIR Model of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surveillance of behavioral interactions between individuals in bird populations is important to understand social dynamics and explain distribution patterns caused by competition for food and space. For waterbirds, little is known about interactions between individuals at high-tide roosts. In the present study, we used surveying with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to provide enhanced information on previously hidden aspects of the highly dynamic communities of roosting waterbirds in the non-breeding season. Fine-scale density estimations, derived from aerial photos obtained with UASs, were used as a measure to explain intra- and inter-species interactions for 10 selected waterbird species on a major roost site in the Danish Wadden Sea. Uniquely defined density distributions were detected, which, to some degree, were dependent on species and species size, with smaller waders exhibiting densely packed flocks (e.g., dunlin Calidris alpina and golden plover Pluvialis apricaria), whereas larger species, such as ducks and geese (Anatidae) exhibited lower densities. Multi-species flocks were observed to occur frequently (31.9%) and generally resulted in lower densities than single-species flocks for each of the species involved. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that UAS aerial photos can be used both to assess positions for roosting waterbirds and to classify habitats (i.e., mudflats, vegetated areas, waterline, and flooded areas) during high-tide. This facilitated the collection of precise data for temporal habitat choices for individual species when using the studied roost site.

Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed in comparison to molecular test results and subdivided according to targeted genes (E, RdRP, and N) and days post-symptom onset (PSO). For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO. Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3a100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) < 25. The specificity of AFIAS was 98.7a98.9% and that of ichromaTM was 100.0%. The kappa values of AFIAS and ichromaTM for the molecular testing of specimens with Ct < 25 (RdRP) were 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity of AFIAS and ichromaTM for all genes was lower for specimens collected at 8a14 PSO than for those collected before 7-days PSO. The kinetics profiles showed that antigen levels gradually decreased from &#8804; 7-days PSO to > 22-days PSO. Both RATs showed excellent specificity and acceptable sensitivity for NP specimens with higher viral loads and for specimens collected within 7-days PSO.

Parents reported their stress level, their childs well-being, and their childs problem behaviors among others. Results showed that most parents and children experienced lockdown-related stress.

Older children (7-10 years) evidenced more emotional symptoms as well as less conduct problems and hyperactivity than younger children (3-6 years). Childrens own and their parents stress level, the degree to which children missed other children, and childrens age all showed to be negatively related to childrens general life satisfaction. Single parenthood and being an only child were associated with higher levels of child problems. Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychological well-being of children and their families during governmental lockdown measures, as well as on relations between childrens coping and demographic background.

Antibody affinity in patient plasma samples was similar against the wild-type, delta, and omicron variants (KA ranges: 122{+/-}155, 159{+/-}148, 211{+/-}307 M-1, respectively), indicating a surprisingly broad and mature cross-clade immune response.

People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they're financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT.

Emergency contraception and induced abortion are overlooked in policy and research. Men's roles in the SRHR of others are significant, particularly as obstacles to universal SRHR. Evidence on gender, masculinities and SRHR is essential to understand and reduce the barriers faced by individuals seeking to avoid the conception or continuation of a pregnancy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to understand men's masculinities and their relationships with emergency contraception and abortion. The protocol presents a multimethod study of men aged over 18 years in James Town, Accra, Ghana. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the research will use two mobile-based methods: a survey and in-depth interviews. Using respondent-driven sampling, an estimated 789 men will be recruited to participate in the survey, asking questions on their knowledge, attitude, behaviours and roles in emergency contraception and abortion. In-depth interviews focused on constructions of masculinity will be conducted with a purposive sample of men who participated in the survey. Data will be analysed concurrently using multiple regression analyses of quantitative data and abductive analysis of qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the London School of Economics and Political Science and the Ghana Health Service. The findings in this study will: engage with emerging research on masculinities and SRHR in Ghana and elsewhere; offer methodological insight for future research; and provide evidence to inform interventions to reduce obstacles for emergency contraception and abortion care seekers.

In open gastrectomy, gastroduodenostomy or gastroenterostomy is often performed with the hand-sewn technique. Therefore, hand-sewn anastomosis was performed through a small incision in LDG. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LDG with hand-sewn anastomosis. METHODS Between June 2009 and December 2015, we assessed 263 consecutive patients who underwent LDG in our institution. In all patients, the reconstruction procedures were performed extracorporeally with the hand-sewn technique. The clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and operation cost related to anastomosis were evaluated and compared with the other methods. RESULTS The average operation time was 157.5 minutes, and average blood loss was 38.8 mL. The types of reconstruction were Billroth I, 95 cases (36.1%); Billroth II, 165 cases (62.7%); and Roux-en-Y, 3 cases (1.1%). The overall incidence of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classificationRGrade II) was 8.0%. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 1 patient (0.4%) and anastomotic bleeding and anastomotic stenosis in 2 patients each (0.8%). There was no postoperative mortality. The cost of the absorbable threads used in anastomosis is less than the cost of a linear or circular stapler, which is often used in intracorporeal anastomosis. CONCLUSION This procedure is similar to conventional open surgery, and it is feasible, safe, and cost-effective.

The serological tests were positive in 1.27% of the patients during the first phase and 2.79% during the second phase. People living in households with more than five members had a prevalence of 10.83% (95%CI: 1.58-74.27) higher than those living alone or with someone other. Considering the proportion of the positive serological test results with sex and age adjustments, approximately 2.37% (95%CI: 1.32-3.42) of the population had been cumulatively infected by mid-June 2020, which is equivalent to 16,670 people (95%CI: 9,267-24,074). Considering that 68 deaths from the disease in the residents of the city had been confirmed as at the date of the second phase of the survey, the infection fatality rate was estimated to be 0.41% (95%CI: 0.28-0.73). Our results suggest that approximately 88% of the cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the survey were not reported to the local epidemiological surveillance service.

Despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) proposing this as standard of care, it does not routinely take place in practice. Healthcare professionals are in a prime position to deliver and integrate these recommendations. A change in the behaviour of clinical teams is therefore required. In this paper, we describe the development of a training package for healthcare professionals using theory and evidence to promote delivery of such recommendations as standard care. METHODS: The intervention development process was guided by the Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Target behaviours were identified from the literature and thirty-five prostate cancer care healthcare professionals (including oncologists, consultant urologists, clinical nurse specialists, physiotherapists, general practitioners and commissioners) were interviewed to understand influences on these behaviours. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to identify theoretical constructs for change. Behaviour change techniques were selected based on theory and evidence and were translated into intervention content. The intervention was refined with the input of stakeholders including healthcare professionals, patients, and exercise professionals in the form of rehearsal deliveries, focus groups and a workshop. RESULTS: Seven modifiable healthcare professional target behaviours were identified to support the delivery of the NICE recommendations including identifying eligible patients suitable for exercise, recommending exercise, providing information, exercise referral, providing support and interpret and feedback on progress. Ten domains from the Theoretical Domains Framework were identified as necessary for change, including improving knowledge and skills, addressing beliefs about consequences, and targeting social influences. These were targeted through twenty-two behaviour change techniques delivered in a half-day, interactive training package. Based on initial feedback from stakeholders, the intervention was refined in preparation for evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: We designed an intervention based on theory, evidence, and stakeholder feedback to promote and support the delivery of NICE recommendations. Future work will aim to test this training package in a multi-centre randomised trial. If proven effective, the development and training package will provide a template for replication in other clinical populations, where exercise has proven efficacy but is insufficiently implemented.

Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO2 were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM2.5, Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O3 all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO2 surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM2.5. O3 surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but Ox (odd oxygen), like NO2 and PM2.5, decreased as expected over these cities.

More than 8 billion vaccines doses have been administered, according to the WHO. Published studies shows that vaccination reduces the number of COVID-19 cases and dramatically reduces COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. In turn, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein poses risks of diminishing the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. In November 2021, the first information appeared about a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was named Omicron. The Omicron variant is of concern because it contains a large number of mutations, especially in the S glycoprotein (16 mutation in RBD), which could be associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies (NtAB) and significantly reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Neutralizing antibodies are one of the important parameters characterizing the protective properties of a vaccine. We conducted a study of neutralizing antibodies in the blood serum of people vaccinated with Sputnik V, as well as those revaccinated with Sputnik Light after Sputnik V. Results showed that a decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies was observed against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in comparison to B.1.1.1 variant. Analysis of the sera of individuals vaccinated with Sputnik V 6-12 months ago showed that there was a decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies by 11.76 folds. While no direct comparison with other vaccines declines has been done in this study, we note their reported decline in antibody neutralization at a much more significant level of 40-84 times. At the same time, the analysis of sera of individuals who were vaccinated with Sputnik V, and then revaccinated Sputnik Light, showed that 2-3 months after revaccination the decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant was 7.13 folds. Despite the decrease in NtAb, we showed that all revaccinated individuals had NtAb to Omicron variant. Moreover, the NtAb level to Omicron variant in revaccinated sera are slightly higher than NtAb to B.1.1.1 in vaccinated sera.","output":"Sputnik Light booster after Sputnik V vaccination induces robust neutralizing antibody response to B.1.1.529 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense disease burden. Although public health countermeasures effectively controlled the epidemic in China, non-pharmaceutical interventions can neither be maintained indefinitely nor conveniently implemented globally. Vaccination is mainly used to prevent COVID-19, and most current antiviral treatment evaluations focus on clinical efficacy. Therefore, we conducted population-based simulations to assess antiviral treatment effectiveness among different age groups based on its clinical efficacy. METHODS: We collected COVID-19 data of Wuhan City from published literature and established a database (from 2 December 2019 to 16 March 2020). We developed an age-specific model to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19. Efficacy was divided into three types: (1) viral activity reduction, reflected as transmission rate decrease [reduction was set as v (0-0.8) to simulate hypothetical antiviral treatments]; (2) reduction in the duration time from symptom onset to patient recovery/removal, reflected as a 1/?3 decrease (reduction was set as 1-3 days to simulate hypothetical or real-life antiviral treatments, and the time of asymptomatic was reduced by the same proportion); (3) fatality rate reduction in severely ill patients (fc) [reduction (z) was set as 0.3 to simulate real-life antiviral treatments]. The population was divided into four age groups (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4), which included those aged &#8804; 14; 15-44; 45-64; and &#8805; 65 years, respectively. Evaluation indices were based on outbreak duration, cumulative number of cases, total attack rate (TAR), peak date, number of peak cases, and case fatality rate (f). RESULTS: Comparing the simulation results of combination and single medication therapy s, all four age groups showed better results with combination medication. When 1/?3 = 2 and v = 0.4, age group 2 had the highest TAR reduction rate (98.48%, 56.01-0.85%). When 1/?3 = 2, z = 0.3, and v = 0.1, age group 1 had the highest reduction rate of f (83.08%, 0.71-0.12%). CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatments are more effective in COVID-19 transmission control than in mortality reduction. Overall, antiviral treatments were more effective in younger age groups, while older age groups showed higher COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to prevention of viral spread and patients deaths when providing antiviral treatments to patients of older age groups.","output":"Effectiveness of potential antiviral treatments in COVID-19 transmission control: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both depression and substance use problems have their highest incidence during youth (i.e., adolescence and emerging adulthood), and are characterized by emotion regulation deficits. Influential neurodevelopmental theories suggest that alterations in the function of limbic and frontal regions render youth susceptible to these deficits. However, whether depression and substance use in youth are associated with similar alterations in emotion regulation neural circuitry is unknown. In this systematic review we synthesized the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation in youth depression and substance use. Resting-state fMRI studies focusing on limbic connectivity were also reviewed. While findings were largely inconsistent within and between studies of depression and substance use, some patterns emerged. First, youth depression appears to be associated with exaggerated amygdala activity in response to negative stimuli; second, both depression and substance use appear to be associated with lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during rest.

However, there must be main pivots for diverse types of depression. From recent therapeutic observations, both the serotonin (5-HT) and kynurenine pathways of tryptophan metabolism may be of particular importance to improved understanding of depression. Here, I propose an etiological classification of depression, based on key peripheral and central enzymes of tryptophan metabolism. DISCUSSION Endogenous depression is caused by a larger genetic component than reactive depression. Besides enterochromaffin and mast cells, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, is also found in 5-hydroxytryptophan-producing cells (5-HTP cells) in normal intestinal enterocytes, which are thought to essentially shunt 5-HT production in 5-HT-producing cells. Genetic studies have reported an association between TPH1 and depression, or the responsiveness of depression to antidepressive medication. Therefore, it is possible that hypofunctional 5-HTP cells (reflecting TPH1 dysfunction) in the periphery lead to deficient brain 5-HT levels. Additionally,it has been reported that higher TPH2 expression in depressed suicides may reflect a homeostatic response to deficient 5-HT levels. Subsequently, endogenous depression may be caused by TPH1 dysfunction combined with compensatory TPH2 activation. Reactive depression results from life stresses and involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with resulting cortisol production inducing tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activation. In secondary depression, caused by inflammation, infection, or oxidative stress, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is activated. In both reactive and secondary depression, the balance between 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and kynurenic acid may shift towards 3-HK production via kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) activation. By shifting the equilibrium position of key enzymes of tryptophan metabolism, the classical classification of depression can be reorganized, as below. Peripheral classification of depression by key enzymes: TPH1 dysfunction, TDO activation, IDO activation. Central classification: TPH2 activation, KMO activation. SUMMARY Etiological classification of depression expressed by peripheral (TPH1, TDO, IDO) and central (TPH2, KMO)enzymes of tryptophan metabolism may enable depression to be viewed as a clear box, with the inner components available for inspection and treatment.","output":"Etiological classification of depression based on the enzymes of tryptophan metabolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to appreciate the tolerance and convenience of a new FFP2 mask allowed the realization of nasal examination in period of pandemic. METHODS: Fifty-one patients were prospectively recruited from two European hospitals to test the FFP2 mask prototype. The following outcomes were evaluated in patients after the clinical examination: fear about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; easiness of mask placement; tolerability; reassurance; and overall satisfaction about the use of this kind of mask in a pandemic context. Seven otolaryngologists evaluated the mask acceptance and usefulness in patients through a standardized physician-reported outcome questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the evaluation. There were 25 males and 25 females. The mean age of patients was 41 years. Ninety percent of patients considered that the use of the mask reduced the risk to be infected during the examination. Seventy percent of patients reported high or very high satisfaction and should recommend mask to other patients in pandemic period. The realization of nasal examination was easier with optic compared with flexible trans-nasal examination (p = 0.001), which significantly impacted the satisfaction level of physician (p = 0.001).

Utilization of drug repurposing approaches has generated substantial interest in order to overcome these drawbacks. A drastic reduction in the failure rate, which otherwise is ~92%, is achieved with the drug repurposing approach. The recent exploration of the drug repurposing approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has further validated the fact that it is more beneficial to reinvestigate the in-practice drugs for a new application instead of designing novel drugs.

Since that time, the drug repurposing approach has been successfully utilized to develop effective therapeutic strategies against a plethora of diseases. Hence, an extensive application of the drug repurposing approach will not only help to fight the current pandemics more efficiently but also predict and prepare for newly emerging viral infections.

A risk-stratification model that could be used to identify high-risk pediatric patients with HLH who should be considered for second-line therapies, including salvage regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), was developed. METHODS: The medical records of 88 pediatric patients (median age 1.4 years, range 0.2-15 years) with non-malignancy associated secondary HLH were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment strategies included dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed HLH patients with infections other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and unknown causes experienced better 5-year overall survival (OS) than patients with HLH due to autoimmune disease, EBV or immunodeficiency (76% vs. 65, 33.3, 11%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, among all patients, non-response at 8 weeks was the most powerful predictor of poor OS. When treatment response was excluded, hemoglobin < 60 g/L and albumin < 25 g/L at diagnosis were associated with poor OS. In patients with EBV-HLH, hemoglobin < 60 g/L at diagnosis was associated with poor OS. A prognostic risk score was established and weighted based on hazard ratios calculated for three parameters measured at diagnosis: hemoglobin < 60 g/L (2 points), platelets < 30  109/L (1 point), albumin < 25 g/L (2 points).

We now show that the very early innate response also has an immunosuppressive component. Infected cells upregulate the CD47 \\"don't eat me\\" signal, which slows the phagocytic uptake of dying and viable cells as well as downstream antigen-presenting cell (APC) functions. A CD47 mimic that acts as an essential virulence factor is encoded by all poxviruses, but CD47 expression on infected cells was found to be upregulated even by pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that encode no mimic. CD47 upregulation was revealed to be a host response induced by the stimulation of both endosomal and cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, including those found in the plasma of hepatitis C patients, upregulated CD47 on uninfected dendritic cells, thereby linking innate modulation with downstream adaptive immune responses. Indeed, results from antibody-mediated CD47 blockade experiments as well as CD47 knockout mice revealed an immunosuppressive role for CD47 during infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Since CD47 blockade operates at the level of pattern recognition receptors rather than at a pathogen or antigen-specific level, these findings identify CD47 as a novel potential immunotherapeutic target for the enhancement of immune responses to a broad range of infectious agents.IMPORTANCE Immune responses to infectious agents are initiated when a pathogen or its components bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR binding sets off a cascade of events that activates immune responses. We now show that, in addition to activating immune responses, PRR signaling also initiates an immunosuppressive response, probably to limit inflammation. The importance of the current findings is that blockade of immunomodulatory signaling, which is mediated by the upregulation of the CD47 molecule, can lead to enhanced immune responses to any pathogen that triggers PRR signaling. Since most or all pathogens trigger PRRs, CD47 blockade could be used to speed up and strengthen both innate and adaptive immune responses when medically indicated. Such immunotherapy could be done without a requirement for knowing the HLA type of the individual, the specific antigens of the pathogen, or, in the case of bacterial infections, the antimicrobial resistance profile.","output":"Upregulation of CD47 Is a Host Checkpoint Response to Pathogen Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT As sports are reinitiated around the United States, the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes remains unknown.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding the club's current phase of return to soccer (individual only, group noncontact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk-reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared with national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases using the local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS A total of 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91 007 players with a median duration of 73 days (interquartile range = 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 clubs that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85 861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the United States (254 versus 477 cases per 100 000; incidence rate ratio = 0.511, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.57; P < .001) and the general population in the counties where data were available (268 versus 864 cases per 100 000; incidence rate ratio = 0.202, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.21; P < .001). After adjusting for the local COVID-19 incidence, we found no relationship between the club COVID-19 incidence and the phase of return (noncontact: b = 0.35  0.67, P = .61; contact: b = 0.18  0.67, P = .79). Soccer clubs reported using a median of 8 (interquartile range = 6-10) risk-reduction procedures. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes was relatively low when compared with the background incidence among children in the United States during the summer of 2020. No relationship was identified between the club COVID-19 incidence and the phase of return to soccer.","output":"COVID-19 in US Youth Soccer Athletes During Summer 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recruiting and retaining staff are standing challenges in eldercare. Low pay, difficult working conditions, and social relations at the workplace impact on turnover intentions. Few studies have used quantitative data for estimating the role of recognition by the wider society for staff instability. This study examines how perceived lack of recognition at the societal level affects Nordic eldercare workers considerations of leaving their jobs. METHODS: The 2015 Nordcare survey among frontline eldercare workers in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden (N = 3,677) is analysed. Issues such as working conditions, financial strain, work-life balance, and appreciation by care recipients and colleagues, were covered. Recognition at the societal level was measured by perceptions of being valued by top municipal leaders, mass media, and the general public. Analyses are made with cross-tabulations and multivariate linear probability regression models. RESULTS: In the total sample, 41.1 % had seriously considered to quit during the last 12 months. About one third felt not at all valued by top municipal leaders, while one fourth felt not at all valued by mass media. In bivariate analyses, perceptions of recognition were strongly associated with considerations to quit. These associations were reduced, but remained sizeable and highly significant in multivariate analyses adjusted for age, gender, health, working conditions, financial stress, workplace relations, and other known turnover predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of recognition by societal agents such as top municipal leaders, mass media, and the general public, is widely felt by Nordic eldercare workers. Feeling poorly valued by such sources is associated with frequent considerations to leave ones employment. Perceived lack of recognition by the wider society has a significant and independent impact on staff instability in the eldercare sector. Societies recognition order is embedded in social structures which are resistant to change, but policies which succeed in raising the societal recognition of eldercare work may contribute to reduced retention difficulties in eldercare.

We evaluated the use and the impact of early PP on clinical outcomes in intubated patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19. Methods: All intubated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 were involved in a secondary analysis from a prospective multicenter cohort study of COVID-ICU network including 149 ICUs across France, Belgian and Switzerland. Patients were followed-up until Day-90. The primary outcome was survival at Day-60. Analysis used a Cox proportional hazard model including a propensity score. Results: Among 2137 intubated patients, 1504 (70.4%) were placed in PP during their ICU stay, and 491 (23%) during the first 24 hrs following ICU admission. One hundred and eighty-one patients (36.9%) of the early PP group had a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio > 150 mmHg when prone positioning was initiated. Among non-early PP group patients, 1013 (47.4%) patients had finally been placed in PP within a median delay of 3 days after ICU admission. Day-60 mortality in non-early PP group was 34.2% vs. 39.3% in the early PP group ( p = 0.038). Day-28 and Day-90 mortality as well as the need for adjunctive therapies were more important in patients with early PP. After propensity score adjustment, no significant difference in survival at Day-60 was found between the two-study groups (HR 1.34 [0.96-1.68], p =0.09 and HR 1.19 [0.998-1.412], p =0.053 in complete case analysis or in multiple imputation analysis, respectively). Conclusions: In a large multicentric international cohort of intubated ICU patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, PP has been used frequently as a main treatment. In this study, early PP started within 24 hrs after ICU admission was not associated with a survival benefit compared to PP after day 1.","output":"Early Prone Positioning in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Related to COVID-19: A Propensity Score Analysis from the Multicentric Cohort COVID-ICU network.

Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in socioeconomic status and the effects of institutional racism, but not health behaviors, sources of information, or attitudes, are playing a role in disparities seen for patients with asthma during COVID-19.","output":"Asthma Disparities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Patients and Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with perplexing clinical sequelae and phenomena that often have no clear link to the underlying infection. There is a wide spectrum of symptoms associated with infection, from minimal respiratory complaints to severe multi-organ failure, often resulting in death. Individuals with malignancies, particularly those whose treatments have left them immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, are among the patient populations thought to be at greater risk for more severe illness. A man with aggressive metastatic chordoma contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus and was diagnosed with COVID-19 while undergoing intravenous brachyury vaccine immunotherapy. His disease course was remarkably mild, and the virus cleared rapidly. Despite a treatment delay of 3 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the patients disease has been stable and tumor-related pain has significantly improved. This suggests not only an intact, functional immune system, but also one that appears to have been responsive to cancer treatment. It has been suggested that individuals undergoing treatment for metastatic cancer are at greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2-related illnesses and complications. While immunosuppression may be a problem, particularly in those receiving conventional chemotherapeutic agents, it is possible that the non-specific effects of immune-enhancing therapies may confer some protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Fast Clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Patient Undergoing Vaccine Immunotherapy for Metastatic Chordoma: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: REGEN-COV antibody cocktail (casirivimab with imdevimab) rapidly reduced viral load and decreased medically-attended visits in the phase 1/2 portion of this trial; REGEN-COV, retains activity in vitro against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Methods: The phase 3 portion of this adaptive, randomized, master protocol, included 4,057 Covid-19 outpatients with one or more risk factors for severe disease. Patients were randomized to a single treatment of intravenous placebo, or various doses of REGEN-COV, and followed for 28 days. The prespecified hierarchical analysis first compared REGEN-COV 2400mg dose vs concurrent placebo, then compared the 1200mg dose vs concurrent placebo, for endpoints assessing risk of hospitalization or death, and time to symptom resolution. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients. Results: Both REGEN-COV 2400mg and 1200mg significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death compared to placebo (71.3% reduction [1.3% vs 4.6%; p<0.0001] and 70.4% reduction [1.0% vs 3.2%; p=0.0024], respectively). The median time to resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was 4 days shorter in both dose arms vs placebo (10 vs 14 days; p<0.0001). Efficacy of REGEN-COV was consistent across subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody-positive at baseline. REGEN-COV more rapidly reduced viral load than placebo. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0%) than in the 1200mg (1.1%) and 2400mg (1.3%) groups and grade []2 infusion-related reactions were infrequent (<0.3% in all groups). Conclusions: Treatment with REGEN-COV was well-tolerated and significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death, rapidly resolved symptoms, and reduced viral load.

Although the encephalopathy is idiopathic in many cases, there are several published reports of patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diverse presentations, risk factors, and outcomes of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We assessed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and a diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome at our institution from April 1 to June 24, 2020. We performed a literature search to capture all known published cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus 2019 at our institution during a 3-month period. One patient was treated with anakinra, an interleukin-1 inhibitor that may disrupt endothelial function. The second patient had an underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection. We found 13 total cases in our literature search, which reported modest blood pressure fluctuations and a range of risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. One patient was treated with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor that may have effects on endothelial function. All patients had an improvement in their neurological symptoms. Interval imaging, when available, showed radiographic improvement of brain lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 may include underlying infection or immunomodulatory agents with endothelial effects in conjunction with modest blood pressure fluctuations. We found that the neurological prognosis for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 infection is favorable. Recognition of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in this patient population is critical for prognostication and initiation of treatment, which may include cessation of potential offending agents and tight blood pressure control.","output":"Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: Two Cases and A Review of The Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter presents an analysis of the exterior context in which investing, company building, finance, and economics are currently operating.

Data Sources: Original clinical-trial research articles published in NEJM (n = 206) or JAMA (n = 188) from January 1 to December 31, 2017; self-reported COI disclosure forms submitted to NEJM or JAMA with the authors published articles; Open Payments website (from database inception; latest search: August 2019). Main outcome measures: Financial data reported to Open Payments from 2014 to 2016 (time period that included all subjects requisite disclosure windows) were compared to self-reported disclosure forms submitted to the journals. Payments were defined as those not associated with a research study or formal research funding. Payment types were categorized as disclosed, undisclosed, indeterminate, or unrelated. Results: Thirty-one articles from NEJM and 31 articles from JAMA met inclusion criteria. The physician-authors (n = 118) received a combined total of $7.48 million.

However, multiple dosing may not be widely applicable in the field. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of reduced treatment frequencies with BKI 1369 against porcine cystoisosporosis in vitro and in vivo. Pre-incubation of sporozoites with BKI 1369 completely failed to inhibit the infection in vitro unless treatment was prolonged post-infection. Notably, a single treatment of infected cell cultures 2 days post-infection (dpi) resulted in a significant reduction of merozoite replication. In an experimental infection model, treatment of suckling piglets experimentally infected with C. suis 2 and 4 dpi with 20 mg BKI 1369/kg body weight completely suppressed oocyst excretion. A single treatment on the day of infection or 2 dpi suppressed oocyst excretion in 50% and 82% of the piglets and reduced the quantitative excretion in those that shed oocysts by 95.2% and 98.4%, respectively. Moreover, a significant increase in body weight gain and reduced number of diarrhea days were observed in BKI 1369 treated piglets compared to the control piglets, irrespective of time points and frequencies of treatment.

Methods: The data of this cross-sectional study were collected in about 2 months (February 28 to April 26, 2020). Data analysis was performed from April to May 2020. Participants completed a set of questionnaires via the Wechat Mini-program before starting the online self-help crisis intervention for COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 2,120 Chinese pregnant women who were attending a self-help crisis intervention participated in this study. A survey was developed to address possible stress-related factors in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak, including demographic, socioeconomic, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as COVID-19 related factors. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the 10-item perceived stress scale were, respectively, employed to measure anxiety and stress-related factors. Results: A total of 21.7% (459) of pregnant women reported at least mild anxiety (5 on the GAD-7 scale), and only 82 women reported moderate to severe anxiety (10 on the GAD-7 scale). Factors associated with at least mild anxiety included living in Hubei province (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.32C2.13), nobody providing everyday life support (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.18C2.77), pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.32C2.09), and higher perceived stress (OR = 6.87, 95% CI = 5.42C9.02).

Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the processes allowing SARS-CoV-2 to multiply, because CTP is in demand for four essential metabolic steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis and it is required for synthesis of dolichol-phosphate, a precursor of viral protein glycosylation. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. This unique metabolic setup allowed us to highlight and provide a raison dtre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3?-deoxy-3,4?-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","output":"A path towards SARS-CoV-2 attenuation: metabolic pressure on CTP synthesis rules the virus evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Although there have been associations between diabetes and mortality in COVID-19 patients, it is unclear whether this is driven by the disease itself or whether it can be attributed to an inability to exhibit effective glucose control.

We used a logistic regression model to determine whether average fasting glycemic levels were associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among the diabetic and non-diabetic patients, there were no differences between mortality or length of stay. Mean glucose levels in the first 10 days of admission were higher on average among those who died (150C185 mg/dL) compared with those who survived (125C165 mg/dL). When controlling for multiple variables, there was a significant association between mean fasting glucose and mortality (odds ratio = 1.014, p < 0.001).

Designing ethical surveillance systems is thus a complex task (retroactive and iterative), yet one that is also complicated to implement and evaluate (e.g., sharing, collaboration, and governance). The governance of health surveillance requires attention to ethical concerns about data and knowledge (e.g., performance, trust, accountability, and transparency) and empowerment ethics, also referred to as a form of responsible self-governance. Ethics in reflexive governance operates as a systematic critical-thinking procedure that aims to define its value: What are the \\"right\\" criteria to justify how to govern \\"good\\" actions for a \\"better\\" future? The objective is to lay the foundations for a methodological framework in empirical bioethics, the rudiments of which have been applied to a case study to building reflexive governance in One Health. This ongoing critical thinking process involves \\"mapping, framing, and shaping\\" the dynamics of interests and perspectives that could jeopardize a \\"better\\" future. This paper proposes to hybridize methods to combine insights from collective deliberation and expert evaluation through a reflexive governance functioning as a community-based action-ethics methodology. The intention is to empower individuals and associations in a dialogue with society, which operation is carried out using a case study approach on data sharing systems. We based our reasoning on a feasibility study conducted in Qubec, Canada (2018-2021), envisioning an antibiotic use surveillance program in animal health for 2023. Using the adaptive cycle and governance techniques and perspectives, we synthesize an alternative governance model rooted in the value of empowerment.

Drawing on the literature in One Health and sustainable development studies, this article describes how a communitarian and pragmatic approach can broaden the vision of feasibility studies to ease collaboration through public-private-academic partnerships.

Group-based restrictions consider differences between groups with respect to risk and benefit. Examples are policies that treat children or senior citizens differently, policies that require travelers to quarantine when traveling to a new destination, and policies that treat individuals differently based on whether they have COVID-19 symptoms, have tested positive for COVID-19, have previous COVID-19 infection, or have been vaccinated against COVID-19. In Part III, I consider the public health law grounding of tailored policies in the principles of \\"least restrictive means\\" and \\"well-targeting.\\" I also examine how courts have analyzed tailored policies that have been challenged on fundamental rights or equal protection grounds. I argue that fundamental rights analyses typically favor tailored policies and that equal protection does not preclude the use of tailored policies even when imperfectly crafted. In Part IV, I consider three critiques of tailored policies, centering on the claims that they produce inequity, cause harm, or unacceptably limit liberty. I argue that we must evaluate restrictions comparatively: the question is not whether tailored policies are perfectly equitable, wholly prevent harm, or completely protect liberty, but whether they are better than untailored ones at realizing these goals in a pandemic. I also argue that evaluation must consider indirect harms and benefits as well as direct and apparent ones.","output":"Tailoring Public Health Policies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To find out the occurrence and psychosocial risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder in COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients presented to ENT and neurology clinics of a tertiary care hospital.

These networks could be both formal and informal, with positive effects seen at both individual and community levelsespecially during crisis management. In building urban resilience and to ensure access to support and services, social capital has been fundamental throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to explore different forms of social capital networks in the informal urban settlements (known as slums) of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and how these networks were helpful during the pandemic. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in three urban slums (Kallyanpur pora bosti, Dholpur, and Shyampur) in Dhaka city). In-depth phone interviews with residents (aged 18 years) of the slums were carried out by the research team, using a semi-structured questionnaire of 13 open-ended questions. Additional probing was done as necessary, depending on the clarity and specificity of the information provided by respondents. We used a snowballing sampling technique and verbal, informed consent was obtained before interviews. Thematic analysis was done. Ethical clearance was acquired from the institutional review board of BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health (2019-034-IR). Findings Between Oct 21, 2020, and Jan 12, 2021, 30 phone interviews were conducted with 22 women and 8 men. Thematic analysis showed that the most marginalised individuals in urban slums are highly dependent upon their social structures, in whom bonding social capital through informal networks is most evident. These networks are based on the trust and reliance built among people whilst living together in close proximity for a long time. Immediate family members and relatives were described as the primary point of contact for any support during emergencies. Respondents who had bridged social capital networks, and were now affiliated with different local community groups, had greater access to relief (such as food, face masks, and soap) and financial support than those who did not form social networks beyond the slums. Informal networks with landlords, local shopkeepers, pharmacies, and neighbours played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing food or cash support or lending goods in credit. Interpretation Strengthening different forms of social capital is vital in building urban resilience and our findings highlight the importance of prevailing social capital networks and their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These challenges included making decisions about how to reduce COVID-19 exposure to their families while still carrying out their employment duties and caring for their children. We sought to understand how frontline workers made these decisions and how these decisions impacted their experiences.Methods: Between October 2020 and May 2021, we conducted 61 semi-structured interviews in English or Spanish, with individuals who continued to work outside of the home during the pandemic and had children living at home. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using abductive methods.Results: Frontline workers experienced moral distress, the inability to act in accordance with their values and obligations because of internal or external constraints. Their moral distress was a result of the tensions they felt as workers and parents, which sometimes led them to feel like they had to compromise on either or both responsibilities. Individuals felt morally conflicted because 1) their COVID-19 work exposures presented risk that often jeopardized their family's health; 2) their work hours often conflicted with their increased childcare responsibilities; and 3) they felt a duty to their colleagues, patients/customers, and communities to continue to show-up to work.Conclusions: Our findings point to a need to expand the concept of moral distress to include the perspectives of frontline workers outside of the healthcare professions and the fraught decisions that workers make outside of work that may impact their moral distress. Expanding the concept of moral distress also allows for a justice-based framing that can focus attention on the disparities inherent in much frontline work and can justify programmatic recommendations, like increasing paid childcare opportunities, to alleviate moral distress.","output":"Navigating Pandemic Moral Distress at Home and at Work: Frontline Workers' Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Limited prior data suggest that pre-existing liver disease was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. We sought to evaluate the association between FIB-4 at an early stage of infection and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. RESULTS: Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein). CONCLUSIONS: FIB-4 at early-stage of COVID-19 had an independent and dose-dependent association with adverse outcomes during hospitalization.

Nosocomial influenza is particularly concerning as it may affect patients at high risk for complications. Unvaccinated health care workers (HCWs) are an important source of nosocomial influenza and therefore a priority target group for vaccination. Despite the fact that some European countries have high coverage rates such as UK (76.8% in season 2020/21), others continue to have low coverage rates for influenza vaccines. This study aims to estimate vaccination coverage in HCWs in Cyprus, an island country located in the Eastern Mediterranean region and describe their attitudes towards influenza vaccination. METHODS: This is a questionnaire based, nation-wide study assessing flu vaccination coverage in 2019-2020 and attitudes related to vaccination acceptance, of 962 HCWs in both public and private health care facilities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with flu vaccination status. RESULTS: Flu vaccination coverage was estimated as 31.8%. The top two reasons for getting vaccinated were to protect their family (81.4%) and themselves (77.4%). The top two reasons for not getting immunised, besides \\"no particular reason\\" (25.7%), included disbelief for vaccine effectiveness (21.5%) and safety (29.3%). The regression model showed that doctors compared to nurses had 10 times the odds of being vaccinated. Other factors positively associated with flu vaccination were encouragement by the supervisor, having sufficient knowledge on flu and flu vaccination and easy access to vaccination. A percentage of 54.8% of participants stated that COVID-19 pandemic strongly or somewhat influenced their decision to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Flu vaccination coverage in HCWs in Cyprus is rather low, similar to some other European countries. Barriers and facilitators in this study can be considered in strategies to increase flu vaccination uptake.

This is in sharp contrast to most existing DAG learning methods assuming Gaussian noise with additional variance assumptions to attain exact DAG recovery. The proposed method leverages a novel concept of topological layer to facilitate the DAG learning. Particularly, we show that the topological layers can be exactly reconstructed in a bottom-up fashion, and the parent-child relations among nodes in each layer can also be consistently established. More importantly, the proposed method does not require the faithfulness or parental faithfulness assumption which has been widely assumed in the literature of DAG learning. Its advantage is also supported by the numerical comparison against some popular competitors in various simulated examples as well as a real application on the global spread of COVID-19.","output":"Learning linear non-Gaussian directed acyclic graph with diverging number of nodes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth differentiation 15 (GDF15) is a potential novel biomarker of biological aging. To separate the effects of chronological age and birth cohort from biological age, longitudinal studies investigating the associations of GDF15 levels with adverse health outcomes are needed. We investigated changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years in an age-stratified sample of the general population and their relation to the risk of acute hospitalization and death. Serum levels of GDF15 were measured three times in 5-year intervals in 2176 participants aged 30, 40, 50, or 60 years from the Danish population-based DAN-MONICA cohort. We assessed the association of single and repeated GDF15 measurements with the risk of non-traumatic acute hospitalizations. We tested whether changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years differed according to the frequency of hospitalizations within 2 years or survival within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement. The change in GDF15 levels over time was dependent on age and sex. Higher GDF15 levels and a greater increase in GDF15 levels were associated with an increased risk of acute hospitalization in adjusted Cox regression analyses. Participants with more frequent admissions within 2 years, and those who died within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement already had elevated GDF15 levels at baseline and experienced greater increases in GDF15 levels during the study. The change in GDF15 levels was associated with changes in C-reactive protein and biomarkers of kidney, liver, and cardiac function.

The aim of the study is to confirm or refute scientific hypothesis that these restrictive measures may be designated as the experimental legal regimes of mobilization type. The research methodology is based on formal logics, structural and systemic analysis as well as on legal forecasting and legal interpretation methods. The theoretical basis of the re-search includes well-known legal science categories, i.e. legal regime and legal experiment that get a new interpretation with the appearance of experimental legal regime institute. The main results of the research, scope of application. Experimental legal regime is a broader legal phenomenon than regulatory sandboxes, which includes not only regulation of the digital innovation sphere, but also other rules that are limited in time and space. There are legal regimes with signs of experimentation that are not officially identified by the state as experimental legal regimes. The work studied the experience which arose due to modern changes in state and legal regulation caused by the global epidemic of COVID-19. It is suggested to divide the legal experiments according to the purpose of ex-perimental legislation into the following groups: optimizing, progressive and mobilization ones. The aim of the first group named \\"Optimizing legal experiments\\" is to test using of new regulation applied to a large and complex object. The second group named \\"Progres-sive legal experiments\\" is intended to check whether the abandonment of old laws is ben-eficial in the innovation field. The result is creation of a smart regulation for economic and technological development. The third group named \\"Mobilization legal experiments\\" is aimed at maintaining of the existing level of resources, security, and infrastructure in the event of critical situations. It is being proved that the legal restrictions aimed at preventing of COVID-19 viral infection spreading can be classified as experimental legal regimes of mo-bilization type. The criterion for distinguishing of mobilization experimental legal regimes from others is the voluntary participation in the legal experiment and the goal of the exper-imental legal regime. Conclusions. The development of mobilization experimental legal regimes implies raising of their legality. It can be achieved by the provision of legal guarantees such as the goals of the legal experiment and the evaluation of their consequences. This will allow identify whether the consequences of the experiment correspond to the goals of the new legal reg-ulation. There must be grounds for limitations to legal certainty caused by legal experimen-tation. Their manifestation is the goal and evaluation criteria, with the help of which it is possible to determine whether the consequences of the establishment of the experiment correspond to the goals of the new legal regulation. Otherwise, there is a risk of unjustified infringement of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens.","output":"Experimental Legal Regimes of Mobilization Type as a Method of Legal Regulation in the Context of Covid-19 Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a known finding after total hip arthroplasty (THA) that potentially affects clinical outcomes. The incidence of HO is related to various factors, including soft-tissue trauma, postoperative medication, surgical approach, and the surgeon's experience. Because use of the direct anterior approach (DAA) is gaining popularity, we aimed (1) to determine the incidence of HO after DAA-THA and (2) to evaluate the impact of HO on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 401 THAs (67  10 years old, 210 men). The incidence and grade of HO were evaluated using the Brooker classification with anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. PROs were collected with use of the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI)-Hip and were correlated with HO grades using generalized multiple regression models. RESULTS: The incidence of HO was 29.9% on the anteroposterior radiographic views (Brooker grade 1, 14.5%; grade 2, 11.1%; grade 3, 2.7%; and grade 4, 0.57%); the lateral radiographic views detected 9% additional HO when compared with the anteroposterior radiographs alone (Brooker grade 1, 8%, and grade 2, 1%). HO was more frequent in men. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, age in women, and higher body mass index (BMI) in men were associated with higher HO grades. A transverse \\"bikini\\" incision was associated with a lower rate (4%) of Brooker grades 3 and 4 HO when compared with a longitudinal incision (12%). A Brooker grade of 0 to 3 HO did not impact outcomes. Only Brooker grade-4 HO was associated with significantly worse PROs; however, pain was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade HO after DAA-THA is not uncommon, and its rate is underestimated when anteroposterior radiographic views are evaluated without lateral views. The risk factors for developing HO in our cohort were an ASA grade of >3, male sex (especially with a high BMI), older age in women, and use of longitudinal incisions. With use of the bikini incision, patients had lower rates of severe HO, but mostly senior surgeons with more experience performed their surgery. Age, ASA grade, experience level of the surgeon, and Brooker grade-4 HO all had a significant influence on PROs. Clinically important HO (Brooker grade 4) remains rare after DAA-THR.

However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, R(0), and R(eff)) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.","output":"A Likelihood Approach for Real-Time Calibration of Stochastic Compartmental Epidemic Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) is the cause of the new viral infectious disease (coronavirus disease 2019;COVID?19) Emerging evidence indicates that COVID?19 may be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms and complications with central nervous system (CNS) involvement It is now well?established that entry of SARS?CoV?2 into host cells is facilitated by its spike proteins mainly through binding to the angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE?2) Preclinical studies have suggested that neuropilin?1 (NRP1), which is a transmembrane receptor that lacks a cytosolic protein kinase domain and exhibits high expression in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, may also be implicated in COVID?19 by enhancing the entry of SARS?CoV?2 into the brain through the olfactory epithelium In the present study, we expand on these findings and demonstrate that the NRP1 is also expressed in the CNS, including olfactory?related regions such as the olfactory tubercles and paraolfactory gyri This furthers supports the potential role of NRP1 as an additional SARS?CoV?2 infection mediator implicated in the neurologic manifestations of COVID?19 Accordingly, the neurotropism of SARS?CoV?2 via NRP1?expressing cells in the CNS merits further investigation","output":"Neuropilin?1 as a new potential SARS?CoV?2 infection mediator implicated in the neurologic features and central nervous system involvement of COVID?19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to major challenges in clinical decision making when the demand for intensive care exceeds local capacity In order to promote consistent, transparent, objective and ethical decision making, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) formed a committee to urgently develop guidelines outlining key principles that should be utilised during the pandemic This guidance is intended to support the practice of intensive care specialists during the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote the development of local admission policies that should be endorsed by health care organisations and relevant local authorities","output":"ANZICS guiding principles for complex decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-stakes and high-volume English language proficiency tests typically rely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to assess reading and listening skills Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, more institutions are using MCQs via online assessment platforms, which facilitate shuffling the order of options within test items to minimize cheating There is scant research on the role that order and sequence of options plays in MCQs, so this study examined the results of a paper-based, high-stakes English proficiency test administered in two versions Each version had identical three-option MCQs but with different ordering of options The test-takers were chosen to ensure a very similar profile of language ability and level for the groups who took the two versions The findings indicate that one in four questions exhibited significantly different levels of difficulty and discrimination between the two versions The study identifies order dominance and sequence priming as two factors that influence the outcomes of MCQs, both of which can accentuate or diminish the power of attraction of the correct and incorrect options These factors should be carefully considered when designing MCQs in high-stakes language proficiency tests and shuffling of options in either paper-based or computer-based testing","output":"The Role of Order and Sequence of Options in Multiple-choice Questions for High-stakes Tests of English Language Proficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus with sudden and widespread outbreak has obviously imposed devastating consequences in various aspects of human life. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of Pender's health promotion model (HPM) structures in self-care preventive behavior against COVID-19 among the general population of Ardabil, Iran. Methods: The present retrospective descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 200 citizens of Ardabil aged 18 and over in 2020, who were selected by convenience sampling through social media. Data collection tools included demographic profile, perceived self-efficacy scale, perceived emotions questionnaire, perceived social support questionnaire, perceived benefits and barriers questionnaire, researcher-made COVID-19 self-care questionnaire and commitment to action questionnaire based on Pender's HPM structures in an online manner. Data were analyzed by Amos 22 software and using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: According to the results, direct path analysis to COVID-19 self-care behavior indicated that the variables of perceived self-efficacy, interpersonal effects, positive emotion and perceived benefits are able to significantly predict self-care behaviors. Moreover, the bootstrapping test results in the indirect path analysis demonstrated that the variables of perceived self-efficacy, perceived social support, and perceived barriers and benefits through the mediator variable of commitment to action are able to significantly predict COID-19 self-care behavior. Conclusions: Based on the findings of the present study, it can be claimed that the proposed model of COVID-19 self-care behavior has an acceptable fitness in the general population.

The hepatitis B virus-encoded HBx oncoprotein is known to perform an overwhelming array of functions in the cell and has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its structure has not been elucidated. HBx carries nine conserved cysteine residues that have proven to be crucial for its various functions. However, the status of disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues reported in previous studies remains discrepant because of the use of refolded recombinant HBx that may contain non-native disulfides. Now we have determined the disulfide linkages in soluble and biologically active recombinant maltose binding protein-HBx fusion protein using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We report four disulfide linkages in HBx protein, viz., between Cys(7) and Cys(69), Cys(61) and Cys(115), Cys(78) and Cys(137), and Cys(17) and Cys(143), based on the differential mobility of corresponding disulfide-linked peptide ions under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cys(148) was observed to be free. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys(143) and Cys(148) with serine and functional analyses of these mutants affirmed the importance of these residues in the ability of HBx to potentiate Cdk2/cyclin E kinase activity and transcriptionally activate promoter reporter gene activity. Thus, this study identifies native disulfide linkages in the structure of a biologically active viral oncoprotein.","output":"Mass spectrometric determination of disulfide bonds in the biologically active recombinant HBx protein of hepatitis B virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hand hygiene actions are essential to reduce healthcare-associated infections and the development of antimicrobial resistance.

There is no specific therapeutics to encounter the COVID-19. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy is an efficient strategy to control human viral infections employing post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) through neutralizing target complementary mRNA. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by the viral RdRp gene as a part of the replication-transcription complex can be adopted as an acceptable target for controlling SARS-CoV-2 mediated infection. Therefore, in the current study, accessible siRNA designing tools, including significant algorithms and parameters, were rationally used to design the candidate siRNAs against SARS-COV-2 encoded RdRp. The designed siRNA molecules possessed adequate nucleotide-based and other features for potent gene silencing. The targets of the designed siRNAs revealed no significant matches within the whole human genome, ruling out any possibilities for off-target silencing by the siRNAs. Characterization with different potential parameters of efficacy allowed selecting the finest siRNA among all the designed siRNA molecules. Further, validation assessment and target site accessibility prediction also rationalized the suitability of this siRNA molecule. Molecular docking study between the selected siRNA molecule and component of RNA interference (RNAi) pathway gave an excellent outcome. Molecular dynamics of two complexes: siRNA and argonaute complex, guide RNA, and target protein complex, have shown structural stability of these proteins. Therefore, the designed siRNA molecule might act as an effective therapeutic agent against the SARS-CoV-2 at the genome level and can prevent further outbreaks of COVID-19 in humans.","output":"Designing an effective therapeutic siRNA to silence RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Premature obsolescence of existing buildings is a significant challenge for sustainable regeneration in cities internationally. Adaptive reuse is one approach to address obsolescence in cities globally. High vacancy can be a crucial predictor of obsolescence, but vacancy is poorly understood and can be 'hidden'.

VVAM permits detailed visualisation of the location and quantity of vacancy, including Greyspace, a form of hitherto undetectable vacancy. To test VVAM, this paper reports its application to a population of office buildings (n=118) in Adelaide, an Australian city reporting high office building vacancy. VVAM revealed the vacancy distribution did not lend itself to whole building adaptive reuse, despite the universal advocacy for greater adaptive reuse globally. This finding implies whole building adaptive reuse may not be appropriate to address vacancy in all cities.

In this paper, a transfer learning model is proposed to automate the process of identifying the people who are not wearing mask. The proposed model is built by fine-tuning the pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning model, InceptionV3. The proposed model is trained and tested on the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD).

Both BA.1 and BA.2 viruses replicated substantially faster in animal lungs than the early G614 (B.1) strain in the absence of pre-existing immunity, possibly explaining the increased transmissibility despite their functionally compromised spikes.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory disease that is currently spreading all over the world and caused by this coronavirus. Its common symptoms are highly similar to those of other viruses, such as fever, cough and dyspnea. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Everyone is susceptible to infection with this disease, and owing to the long-term use of immunosuppressants, the immunity of kidney transplant recipients is suppressed, and it is more likely to be infected with the disease. At present, its impact on kidney transplant recipients is unclear. This article reports the clinical features and therapeutic course of novel coronavirus infection in a patient after renal transplantation. A 37-year-old female patient who received a kidney transplant 6 months before was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia. The patient's symptoms (such as fever, chills, dry cough, muscle aches), laboratory tests (such as decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes and D-dimer, positive viral nucleic acid test), and chest CT (multiple left lower lung plaque ground glass shadow) were similar to those of non-transplanted novel coronavirus pneumonia patients. In terms of treatment, because the immunity of kidney transplant recipients has been suppressed for a long time, it is a very common strategy to suspend the use of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, the patient immediately discontinued the immunosuppressive agent after admission, so that she could restore immunity against infection in a short time. At the same time, the use of glucocorticoids was also very important. Its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects played a large role in the treatment process.In addition, prophylactic antibiotics was needed, and nephrotoxic drugs should be used with caution. Finally, following discounting the use of immunosuppressant and a low-dose glucocorticoid-based treatment regimen, COVID-19 in this renal transplant recipient was successfully cured. The cure of this case was of great significance, and this adjuvant nonspecific antiviral therapy could provide a template for the treatment of other such patients.","output":"[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in renal transplant recipients: A case report]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated immunity is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune suppression is indicated by low monocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen D-related (mHLA-DR). T cells are important antiviral cells. We aimed to assess the role of mHLA-DR and T lymphocyte frequency in predicting COVID-19 severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 97 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, including mild to moderate (n = 49) and severe cases admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 48). These ICU cases were further subdivided into survivors (n = 35) and non-survivors (n = 13). RESULTS: Severe cases had a significant decrease in the mHLA-DR mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and T lymphocyte percentage compared to mild to moderate cases (P<0.001). Non-survivors had a lower T lymphocyte percentage (P=0.004) than survivors. The mHLA-DR MFI and T lymphocyte percentage correlated with oxygen saturation (r=0.632, P<0.001) and (r=0.669, P<0.001), respectively. According to the ROC curves, mHLA-DR MFI, at a cutoff of 143 and an AUC of 0.9, is a reliable biomarker for distinguishing severe COVID-19 cases, with 89.6% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity, while T lymphocyte frequency had 81.3% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity at a cutoff of 54.4% and an AUC of 0.9. The T lymphocyte percentage as a predictor of ICU survival at a cutoff of 38.995% exhibited 100% sensitivity and 57.1% specificity. According to multivariate regression analysis, reduced mHLA-DR MFI and T lymphocyte percentage are independent predictors of COVID-19 severity (OR = 0.976, 95% CI: 0.955C0.997, P = 0.025) and (OR = 0.849, 95% CI: 0.741C0.972, P = 0.018), respectively. CONCLUSION: Reduced mHLA-DR expression and T-lymphocyte percentage are independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Oxygen saturation percentage is correlated with mHLA-DR MFI and T lymphocyte frequency.

Unlike psoriasis vulgaris, in which a key role is played by the adaptive immune system and interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 axis, PP seems to be characterized by an intense inflammatory response resulting from innate immunity hyperactivation, with prominent involvement of the IL-36 axis. Some nosological aspects of PP are still controversial and debated. Moreover, owing to the rarity and heterogeneity of PP forms, data on prognosis and therapeutic management are limited. Recent progresses in the identification of genetic mutations and immunological mechanisms have promoted a better understanding of PP pathogenesis and might have important consequences on diagnostic refinement and treatment.

After 48 h, reduction in growth associated with increased sensitivity index, As bio-accumulation, and oxidative stress was observed which further intensified after 96 h but the degree of damage was lesser than 48 h. It denotes a significant recovery in growth after 96 h which is correlated with decreased As bio-accumulation and oxidative stress due to increased efficiency of AsA-GSH cycle and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Both the species of As caused significant rise in oxidative biomarkers as evident by in -vitro analysis of O2-, H2O2, and MDA equivalent contents despite appreciable rise in the activity antioxidative enzymes APX, DHAR, and GR. The study concludes that among both forms of arsenic, AsIII induced more toxic effect on growth by over-accumulating the ROS as evident by weak induction of AsA-GSH cycle to overcome the stress as compared to AsV. Further, with increasing the time exposure, apparent recovery was noticed with the lower doses of AsV, i.e., 50 and 100 mM and AsIII, i.e., 50 and 100 M; however, the toxicity further aggravated with higher dose of both AsV and AsIII.

Here, we aimed to evaluate autoantibodies targeting NETs in patients with primary APS, and to determine their potential functions and clinical associations. METHOD We measured global anti-NET activity in 76 patients with primary APS, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 11 patients with history of unprovoked venous thrombosis without aPL, and 44 healthy controls. The ability of APS sera to degrade NETs was also assessed. RESULT We found markedly elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM in patients with primary APS as compared with healthy controls (IgG mean optical density 0.55  0.34 vs. 0.33  0.17; IgM mean optical density 0.76  0.51 vs. 0.26  0.23). This anti-NET activity did not correlate with levels of traditional aPL and was relatively stable over time. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies (especially of the IgG isotype) impaired the ability of patient sera to degrade NETs (r=0.4, p=0.003). Levels of anti-NET IgM inversely correlated with complement C4 (r=0.4, p=0.019). Clinically, anti-NET antibodies associated with certain APS clinical manifestations, and in particular recurrent venous thrombosis (OR=4.3, p=0.002). Interestingly, anti-NET antibodies also appeared to associate with unprovoked venous thrombosis in the general population (IgM mean optical density 0.67  0.34 vs. 0.26  0.23). CONCLUSION These data reveal high levels of anti-NET antibodies in patients with primary APS, which may impair NET clearance and activate the complement cascade. These findings may ultimately enable more effective risk stratification.","output":"Anti-NET antibodies and impaired NET degradation in antiphospholipid syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are several definitions of the quality of healthcare services. It may be defined as a level of value provided by any health care resource, as determined by some measurement. Scientists use a variety of quality measures to attempt to determine health care quality. They use special indicators or based on a patients' or healthcare professional's perception. This article aims to provide a short review of the available data on the quality of healthcare services in selected European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The research was done by the use of online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. All the studies focused on the quality of healthcare services, yet the studies used different methods to measure this quality. In addition, the results of the authors' survey on the assessment of the quality of healthcare services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were presented. RESULTS: Among twelve studies, four were from the United Kingdom and one each of Catalonia, Italy, Sweden, Poland, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium. Patients in the United Kingdom felt that the quality of services was good during the pandemic, whereas the quality declined in the other studies cited. The results of our research also revealed a decrease in the quality of healthcare services provided.

Computational analysis indicates that T cells migrate with an intermittent mode, switching between confined and almost straight migration, guided by lung-associated vasculature. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is required for both high-speed migration and straight motion. By contrast, inhibition of G(i) signaling with pertussis toxin affects speed but not the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells.

METHODS: To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were compared between user groups. RESULTS: Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P < .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to usual circumstance scenarios.

After observing a beneficial response to micronutrient repletion (MR) in a 69 year-old male with SvC19, we hypothesized that nutritional deficiencies were linked to the pathogenesis and that correcting them could be beneficial. In this report we detail a case series of 18 older patients with SvC19 treated with MR. METHODS: All patients had SvC19 requiring mechanical ventilation, elevated levels of CRP, D-dimer and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. MR consisted of daily parenteral ascorbate, thiamine, pyridoxine and multivitamins, as well as daily ergocalciferol, zinc and carnitine via nasogastric tube. RESULTS: The average age was 63.3 years. Six patients were male, 12 female. Disease severity was comparable based on SOFA score. A partial response was observed in 10 of the 18 patients (55.5%).

A number of minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced as a treatment to prevent glaucoma progressing. Among them, endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) is a cyclodestructive procedure developed by Martin Uram in 1992. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ECP in people with open angle glaucoma (OAG) and primary angle closure whose condition is inadequately controlled with drops. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 12 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECP compared to other surgical treatments (other minimally invasive glaucoma device techniques, trabeculectomy), laser treatment or medical treatment. We also planned to include trials where these devices were combined with phacoemulsification compared to phacoemulsification alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors planned to independently extract data from reports of included studies using a data collection form and analyse data based on methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was proportion of participants who were drop-free (not using eye drops). Secondary outcomes included mean change in IOP; proportion of participants who achieved an IOP of 21 mmHg or less, 17 mmHg or less or 14 mmHg or less; and proportion of participants experiencing intra- and postoperative complications, We planned to measure all outcomes in the short-term (six to 18 months), medium-term (18 to 36 months), and long-term (36 months onwards). MAIN RESULTS We found one ongoing study that met our inclusion criteria (ChiCTR-TRC-14004233). The study compares combined phacoemulsification with ECP to phacoemulsification alone in people with primary angle closure glaucoma. The primary outcome is intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of IOP-lowering drugs. A total of 50 people have been enrolled. The study started in February 2014 and the trialists have completed recruitment and are in the process of collecting data.

Hence, we seek to link the negative emotional contagion in the network at the macroscopic level to the emotional choices of individuals, and model parameters are used at the microcosmic level to measure the copying and mutation probabilities of negative sentiments in an event. Our results illustrate the emotional choices of users play essential roles in methods for mitigating harmful emotion spread and promoting meaningful emotion diffusion.","output":"Sentiment mutation and negative emotion contagion dynamics in social media: a case study on the Chinese Sina Microblog"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mosquito coil fumes (MCF) is used in several Nigerian homes and some part of the world with reported grave consequences to the respiratory tract majorly.

AIM: To review whether prescribing for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 adhered to existing local guidance or whether there was deviation which may represent a need for revised guidance or specialist support in particular patient groups. DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective review of the electronic patient record of 61 hospital inpatients referred to the specialist palliative care team with swab-confirmed COVID-19 who subsequently died over a 1-month period. Intubated patients were excluded. RESULTS: In all, 83% (40/48) of patients were prescribed opioids at a starting dose consistent with existing local guidelines. In seven of eight patients where higher doses were prescribed, this was on specialist palliative care team advice. Mean total opioid dose required in the last 24 h of life was 14 mg morphine subcutaneous equivalent, and mean total midazolam dose was 9.5 mg. For three patients in whom non-invasive ventilation was in place higher doses were used.

Early following infection, SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers within the lungs and evaded triggering inflammation and cell death. However, a significant necrotic cell death event in CD45(C) populations, corresponding with peak viral loads, was observed on day 2 after infection. Metabolic reprogramming and inflammation were initiated following this cell death event and corresponded with increased lung interstitial pneumonia, perivascular inflammation, and endothelial hyperplasia together with decreased oxygen saturation. Therapeutic treatment with the RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 improved survival in infected mice and limited inflammation and associated perivascular pathology.

First, in order to segment the intertwined regions of brain tissue accurately, a weighted neighborhood information measure scheme based on local multi information and kernel function is designed. Then, the membership function of fuzzy c-means clustering is used as the spatial constraint of level set model to overcome the sensitivity of level set to initialization, and the evolution of level set function can be adaptively changed according to different tissue information. Finally, the distance regularization term in level set function is replaced by a double potential function to ensure the stability of the energy function in the evolution process. Both real and synthetic MRI images can show the effectiveness and performance of WLSM.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Three SIR models were fit to prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. Results: Presently, the COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly decelerating in NC and the Charlotte region. Infection curves are flattening at both the state and regional level. Relatively speaking, the greater Charlotte region has responded more favorably to the stay-at-home intervention than NC as a whole. While an initial basic SIR model served the purpose of informing decision making in the early days of the pandemic, its forecast increasingly did not fit the data over time. However, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model provided a good fit to the data. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to do capacity planning and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level.

Simultaneously, pRBC membrane stiffness was increasing, with the correlation coefficient 088. Until 19 days, the stiffness grew slowly, in 19-24 days there occurred a transition period, after which its growth rate was three times higher than the initial. A chain of pathological processes developed in pRBC during long storage: pH reduction (linked to increased oxidative stress), then cytoskeletal destruction and an associated increase in pRBC membrane stiffness. CONCLUSION During prolonged storage of pRBCs and their acidification, there is a progression of pRBC cytoskeletal changes and associated increase of membrane stiffness, observed to increase in rate after days 19-24.

Densely populated areas cannot afford an increase in individual transportation due to space limitation, congestion, and pollution. Working towards more effective and inclusive mobility in public areas, this paper compares user experiences of autonomous public transport across Baltic countries, with the final goal of gaining an increased insight into public needs. User experience was evaluated through questionnaires gathered along pilot projects implementing a public transportation line, using an automated electric minibus between 2018 and 2019. To have sufficient diversity in the data, the pilot projects were implemented in several cities in the Baltic Sea Area. The data analysed in this paper specifically refer to the cities of Helsinki (Finland), Tallinn (Estonia), Kongsberg (Norway), and Gdask (Poland). Across all cities, passengers provided remarkably positive feedback regarding personal security and safety onboard. The overall feedback, which was very positive in general, showed statistically significant differences across the groups of cities (Kongsberg, Helsinki, Tallinn and Gdansk), partially explicable by the differences in the route design. In addition, across all cities and feedback topics, males gave a lower score compared to females.

RVF affects sheep, goats, cattle and camels, causing a high rate of abortions and death of newborn lambs. Also, humans can be infected, developing a usually self-limiting disease that can turn into a more severe illness in a low percentage of cases. Although different veterinary vaccines are available in endemic areas in Africa, to date no human vaccine has been licensed. In previous works, we described the selection and characterization of a favipiravir-mutagenized RVFV variant, termed 40Fp8, with potential as a RVF vaccine candidate due to the strong attenuation shown in immunocompromised animal models. Compared to the parental South African 56/74 viral strain, 40Fp8 displayed 7 amino acid substitutions in the L-protein, three of them located in the central region corresponding to the catalytic core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this work, by means of a reverse genetics system, we have analyzed the effect on virulence of these amino acid changes, alone or combined, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the simultaneous introduction of two changes (G924S and A1303T) in the heterologous ZH548-RVFV Egyptian strain conferred attenuated phenotypes to the rescued viruses as shown in infected mice without affecting virus immunogenicity. Our results suggest that both changes induce resistance to favipiravir likely associated to some fitness cost that could be the basis for the observed attenuation in vivo. Conversely, the third change, I1050V, appears to be a compensatory mutation increasing viral fitness.

Intra- and interhospital variation in ranking of hypothetical patients was assessed using Kappa coefficients. Results: Eight Chicago area hospitals responded to the survey assessing scarce resource allocation protocols. For hospitals willing to describe their specific ventilator allocation protocol (n=7), the initial scoring system varied with most utilizing the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (86%) and medical comorbidities (57%). A majority gave priority to pre-defined groups in their initial scoring system (86%), all discussed withdrawal of mechanical ventilation for adult patients (100%), and a minority had exclusion criteria (43%). Forty-nine triage officers from nine hospitals responded to the second survey. Triage officer rankings of hypothetical patients had slight agreement amongst all hospitals (Kappa 0.158) and fair agreement within two hospitals with the most respondents (Kappa 0.21 and 0.25). Almost half of triage officer respondents reported using tiebreakers to rank patients (N=23/49, 47%). Conclusion: Although most Chicago area hospitals surveyed created guidelines for resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines and application of these protocols by triage officers varied significantly.","output":"Regional Variation in COVID-19 Scarce Resource Allocation Protocols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research findings on Capital markets reaction to infectious diseases in emerging market contexts are not comprehensible Therefore, using the daily individual stocks return of 311 listed firms during an estimation period of 250 trading days;this research applies an Event Study Methodology to define the immediate stock market response to Covid19s arrival in Bangladesh Mean Return Model, Market Return Model, and Market model are applied to determine the Average Abnormal Returns and Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns for short term event window Both Parametric and non-parametric tests of the significance of returns around the several event windows suggest that, despite the perceived weak market efficiency, the local stock market shows unprecedented efficient market reaction to the announcement The significant statistical difference of CAAR between industry segments in both pre and post-event windows signifies that the negative impact of the announcement was identical for all industry segments Behavioral overreaction induced Panic selling and herding effect has also been observed among investors due to the announcement Findings from the study will be useful for investors and financial analysts in accessing the unpredictable systematic risk in portfolio diversification while facilitating policymakers to construct contingency strategy ? 2020, Weissberg SRL All rights reserved","output":"Capital market reactions to the arrival of covid-19: A developing market perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack represent a high-risk population for recurrent stroke. No direct comparison exists comparing dual antiplatelet therapy regimens-namely, Ticagrelor and Aspirin versus Clopidogrel and Aspirin. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) will examine the efficacy of these two different antiplatelet regimens in preventing recurrent stroke and mortality up to 30 days. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be searched with the assistance of a medical information specialist. Two independent reviewers will screen studies for inclusion; eligible studies will include randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults presenting with acute minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and compared one or more of the interventions against each other and/or a control. The primary outcomes will be recurrent ischemic stroke up to 30 days from symptom onset. Secondary outcomes will include safety outcomes (I.e. major bleeding and mortality), functional disability, and outcomes up to 90 days from symptom onset. A Bayesian approach to NMA will be implemented using the BUGSnet function in R Software. Between group comparisons for time-to-event (TTE) and dichotomous outcomes will be presented in terms of hazard ratios and odds ratios with 95% credible intervals, respectively. Secondary effect measures of treatment ranking will also be estimated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal research ethics approval are necessary. We will disseminate our findings through scientific conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media/the press. The findings from this review will aid clinicians in decision-making on the choice of antithrombotic therapy in a high-risk stroke population and could be important in the development of future treatment trials and guidelines.

First, we empirically estimate the reproduction numbers for two different states. Then, we develop an age-structured compartmental simulation model for the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak. Finally, we analyze the computational results and show that early trigger social distancing strategies result in smaller death tolls; however, there are relatively larger second waves. Conversely, late trigger social distancing strategies result in higher initial death tolls but relatively smaller second waves. This study shows that decision analytic tools can help policy makers simulate different social distancing scenarios at the early stages of a global outbreak.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed the Timor-Leste Demographic and Health Survey 2016 dataset. A weighted sample of 11 398 Timorese women aged 15C49 years was chosen using a two-stage stratified random sampling technique. Asian criteria-based body mass index (BMI) cut-offs were used to define overweight (BMI 23.0 to <27.5 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI 27.5 kg/m(2)). Frequency of TV viewing was categorised into three groups: (1) not at all, (2) less than once a week and (3) at least once a week. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was performed to identify the correlates of overweight and obesity. Both crude and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) along with a 95% CI were calculated to show the strength of association. RESULTS: Among 11 398 respondents, 19.4% were overweight or obese (overweight: 15.7% and obese: 3.8%). Although about half of the respondents reportedly did not watch TV at all, just over two-thirds watched TV at least once a week. Women who watched TV at least once a week were found to have 1.3 times the odds of being overweight or obese compared with those who never watched TV (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5; p<0.001). However, when stratified by settlement type, the statistical significance stood for the rural women only (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 1.8; p<0.001), after adjusting for the covariates. CONCLUSION: Watching TV at least once a week was found to be a significant correlate of overweight and obesity in rural Timorese women of reproductive age. Further studies need to be undertaken to assess physical activity, sedentary and dietary patterns to clarify the possible mechanism through which TV viewing may influence BMI in those groups.","output":"Association between television viewing and overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Timor-Leste: evidence from the demographic health survey 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 outbreak and the worldwide lockdown policy have an impact on citizens in different countries Social isolation has been difficult for many people, and especially to those experiencing quarantine To identify protective factors from negative outcomes of the quarantine, this study examined the mediation of internet-focused coping, hope and loneliness, in the relationship between staying in quarantine and experiencing psychological distress A total of 275 participants were divided into two subgroups - those who were in quarantine and those who were not - and all completed the following questionnaires: internet-focused coping, loneliness, hope, and brief symptom inventory scales Results revealed that individuals who were in quarantine reported higher levels of distress than did the comparison group The mediation model demonstrated that being in quarantine was related to higher levels of internet-focused coping, and higher levels of psychological distress The mediation of hope predicted decreased distress, whereas loneliness predicted increased distress The results have important practical implications for people who have experienced staying in quarantine Identifying their psychological resources may help to reduce their vulnerability to distress Focused interventions with hope orientation may start positive activation of personal strengths that is crucial for growth and adjustment (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Hope during the covid-19 outbreak: Coping with the psychological impact of quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing evidence suggests that some newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) resist neutralization by antibodies elicited by the early-pandemic wild-type virus.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. METHODS: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. RESULTS: Some surveillance systems  especially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreak  are more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.

Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","output":"The impact of obesity on immune response to infection: Plausible mechanisms and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic-related school closures are impacting the sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescent girls.

METHODS: A total of 244 inpatients aged  60 years with COVID-19 were included in this study, of whom 52 were clinically diagnosed and 192 were microbiologically diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data on hospital admission and outcomes (discharged or died in hospital) of all patients were retrieved from medical records retrospectively. Patients who met the criteria for clinical diagnosis with negative virus test results were assigned to the clinical diagnosis group, whereas those with positive virus test results were assigned to the microbiological diagnosis group. After univariate analyses, two propensity score analyses [i.e., covariate adjustment using propensity score (CAPS) and propensity score matching (PSM)] were conducted to control bias. RESULTS: The clinical and microbiological diagnosis groups demonstrated significant differences in outcomes and in the majority of laboratory findings. After propensity score analyses, many differences between the two groups disappeared and the rate of mortality had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.318 and 0.828 for CAPS and PSM, respectively).

Our innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) integrates data from sensors to trigger game rewards, progress, and feedback based on the real-time behaviors of individuals with HF. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare daily weight monitoring and physical activity behavior adherence by older adults using an SCDG intervention versus a sensors-only intervention in a feasibility randomized controlled trial. METHODS: English-speaking adults with HF aged 55 years or older who owned a smartphone and could walk unassisted were recruited from Texas and Oklahoma from November 2019 to August 2020. Both groups were given activity trackers and smart weighing scales to track behaviors for 12 weeks. The feasibility outcomes of recruitment, retention, intervention engagement, and satisfaction were assessed. In addition to daily weight monitoring and physical activity adherence, the participants knowledge, functional status, quality of life, self-reported HF behaviors, motivation to engage in behaviors, and HF-related hospitalization were also compared between the groups at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 38 participants with HFintervention group (IG; 19/38, 50%) and control group (CG; 19/38, 50%)were enrolled in the study. Of the 38 participants, 18 (47%) were women, 18 (47%) were aged 65 years or older, 21 (55%) had been hospitalized with HF in the past 6 months, and 29 (76%) were White. Furthermore, of these 38 participants, 31 (82%)IG (15/19, 79%) and CG (16/19, 84%)had both weight monitoring and physical activity data at the end of 12 weeks, and 27 (71%)IG (14/19, 74%) and CG (13/19, 68%)participated in follow-up assessments at 24 weeks. For the IG participants who installed the SCDG app (15/19, 79%), the number of days each player opened the game app was strongly associated with the number of days the player engaged in weight monitoring (r=0.72; P=.04) and the number of days with physical activity step data (r=0.9; P<.001). The IG participants who completed the satisfaction survey (13/19, 68%) reported that the SCDG was easy to use. Trends of improvement in daily weight monitoring and physical activity in the IG, as well as within-group improvements in HF functional status, quality of life, knowledge, self-efficacy, and HF hospitalization in both groups, were observed in this feasibility trial. CONCLUSIONS: Playing an SCDG on smartphones was feasible and acceptable for older adults with HF for motivating daily weight monitoring and physical activity. A larger efficacy trial of the SCDG intervention will be needed to validate trends of improvement in daily weight monitoring and physical activity behaviors.

A retrospective cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from 2235 consecutive linked records retrieved from five hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups, and the frequency of CMs used was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semi-individualized CM user group and 17.0% among the non-users. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77, [Formula: see text] = 0.005) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76, [Formula: see text] = 0.009) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients that received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality, especially among severe/critical cases.

A recent study by Hao et al (2020) provided an interesting perspective on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan and inferred that 87% of the infections before 8 March 2020 were not laboratory-confirmed. However we believe that there are a few major issues due to the vagueness in the definitions of compartments and inconsistence in the settings of parameters.

Compared with the model in Hao et al (2020), the active virus carriers were predicted to persist for a longer period in our model which is well consistent with the active virus carriers detected in Wuhan in mid-May. Our model suggests that control measures cannot be easily lifted while continuous efforts are needed to contain the spread of the pandemic;a universal PT-PCR screening is essential to detect hidden cases before lifting control measure.

That is when the Happiness champions were born.ObjectivesTo improve staff morale, recognise and reward small or big acts of kindness, team spirit and dedication while serving in the front line during the current pandemic. All staff (see below in results) within the Children and Young peoples service in Craigavon Hospital were included.MethodsA core team of Happiness champions including 3 paediatric trainees and 1 consultant was created.Laminated cards with cartoon heroes were created, with the phrase you are amazing, keep it up, that is all printed on the back. Small tokens were also included in the prize.An email portal and a whatsapp group of all staff members in paediatrics were used to promote the initiative and receive nominations each week. The nomination could be for any member within the children and young persons department irrespective of grade or role. The person nominating needed to state the reason for nomination to enable the core team to decide the winner each week.Each week, one Hero of the week was announced through the whatsapp group with a summary of the reasons for nomination along with a photo of our Hero. This was also broadcast on social media platforms (after consent) to have a further reach.Results17 Heroes were awarded, one for each week of the lockdown.Members of staff of all levels and areas within paediatrics were nominated (nursing, allied health, administrative, domestics and medical) showing how much positive regard there was despite tough times.100% of our Heroes were happy to receive the award and felt proud to be members of our team.

Mapping the existing literature is necessary to help guide pediatric mindfulness interventions. Our purpose is to synthesize the evidence of reported MBIs for children and adolescents with and without physical, mental, and cognitive disorders. Accordingly, we aim to identify trends and gaps in the literature, so that we can provide direction to researchers who seek to advance the evidence base for using MBIs in pediatric populations. METHODS Our search strategy will be conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. It will include a comprehensive search of published studies in 7 databases, gray literature, conference proceedings, and citations of selected articles. Two independent reviewers will evaluate all abstracts and full articles that have a pediatric sample (children 2-17 years), use MBIs to promote development or to remediate underlying disorders, and are written in English or French. We will identify the definitions and concepts from MBIs, categorize accepted studies according to etiology and rehabilitation type, describe intervention methodology, and report outcomes of selected studies. DISCUSSION Our review will provide a comprehensive overview of the pediatric mindfulness intervention literature to date, involving a range of mental, cognitive, and physical outcomes for healthy children and adolescents and for those with a variety of disorders in clinical and institutional settings. We will disseminate results to mindfulness practitioners and provide guidance to future pediatric researchers in their development and application of mindfulness interventions, thereby contributing to the scientific understanding of mindfulness for the ultimate betterment of child and adolescent well-being and life-long functioning.

However, it is unclear when particularly platelet activation markers and coagulation factors dysregulated during the pathogenesis of COVID\\\\19. Here, we sought to assess the levels of coagulation and platelet activation markers at moderate and severe stages of COVID\\\\19 to understand the pathogenesis. METHODS: To understand this, hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients with (severe cases that required intensive care) or without pneumonia (moderate cases) were recruited. Phenotypic and molecular characterizations were performed employing basic coagulation tests including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D\\\\Dimer, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The flow cytometry\\\\based multiplex assays were performed to assess FXI, anti\\\\thrombin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, FXIII, P\\\\selectin, sCD40L, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor\\\\1 (PAI\\\\1), and D\\\\Dimer. RESULTS: The investigations revealed induction of plasma P\\\\selectin and CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in moderate COVID\\\\19 cases, which were significantly abolished with the progression of COVID\\\\19 severity. Moreover, a profound reduction in plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and FXIII were identified particularly in the severe COVID\\\\19. Further analysis revealed fibrinogen induction in both moderate and severe patients. Interestingly, an elevated PAI\\\\1 more prominently in moderate, and tPA particularly in severe COVID\\\\19 cases were observed. Particularly, the levels of fibrinogen and tPA directly correlated with the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, induction of soluble P\\\\selectin, sCD40L, fibrinogen, and PAI\\\\1 suggests the activation of platelets and coagulation system at the moderate stage before COVID\\\\19 patients require intensive care.

The lung ultrasound is a non-invasive and easily repeatable tool and can be carried out by the pediatrician at the bedside of children with a consequent reduction in the risk of transmission of the virus. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that ultrasound findings in these patients would (1) be associated with their disease severity and (2) change over time in alignment with clinical outcome. METHODS The study was made in the emergency department in a tertiary level pediatric hospital. All patients with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection were subjected to a lung ultrasound within 6 hours from admission and after 96 hours. RESULTS Among a total of 30 children, 18 (60%) were males, 4 reported exertional dyspnea and only 1 chest pain. The mean oxygen saturation was 98.8  1.0 % in ambient air in emergency department and no patient needed oxygen therapy during hospitalization. Children with moderate disease presented more B line (p= 0.03). After 96 hours we had observed ultrasound abnormality only in 20% of the children. We found a statistically significant reduction in pleural irregularities (30% vs 16.7; p= 0.001) and in B lines (50% vs 20%; p= 0.008).

DVGs are often associated with viral passage at high multiplicities of infection in culture systems but have been increasingly reported in clinical specimens. To date however, only RNA viruses have been shown to contain DVGs in clinical specimens. Here, using direct deep sequencing with multiple library preparation strategies and confirmatory digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) of urine samples taken from immunosuppressed individuals, we show that clinical BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) strains contain widespread genomic rearrangements across multiple loci that likely interfere with viral replication. BKPyV DVGs were derived from BKPyV genotypes Ia, Ib-1, and Ic. The presence of DVGs was associated with specimens containing higher viral loads but never reached clonality, consistent with a model of parasitized replication. These DVGs persisted during clinical infection as evidenced in two separate pairs of samples containing BK virus collected from the same individual up to 302 days apart. In a separate individual, we observed the generation of DVGs after a 57.5-fold increase in viral load. In summary, by extending the presence of DVGs in clinical specimens to DNA viruses, we demonstrate the ubiquity of DVGs in clinical virology. IMPORTANCE Defective viral genomes (DVGs) can have a significant impact on the production of infectious virus particles. DVGs have only been identified in cultured viruses passaged at high multiplicities of infection and RNA viruses collected from clinical specimens; no DNA virus in the wild has been shown to contain DVGs. Here, we identified BK and JC polyomavirus DVGs in clinical urine specimens and demonstrated that these DVGs are more frequently identified in samples with higher viral loads. The strains containing DVGs had rearrangements throughout their genomes, with the majority affecting genes required for viral replication. Longitudinal analysis showed that these DVGs can persist during an infection but do not reach clonality within the chronically infected host. Our identification of polyomavirus DVGs suggests that these parasitic sequences exist across the many classes of viruses capable of causing human disease.","output":"In Vivo Generation of BK and JC Polyomavirus Defective Viral Genomes in Human Urine Samples Associated with Higher Viral Loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Picturebooks have become a significant potential informant in the challenge to explain the COVID-19 pandemic to younger children.

Patients' management and outcomes, especially in severe and critical cases, can vary depending on regional standard operating procedures and local guidance. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published on PubMed and Embase between December 15th 2019 and February 28th 2021, reporting in-hospital and respiratory support-related mortality in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that underwent either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Only English language studies with 100 patients and reporting data on respiratory failure were included. Data on comorbidities, ventilatory parameters and hospital-related complications were registered. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Fifty-two studies (287359 patients - 57.5% males, mean age 64 years (range 24-98)) from 17 different countries were included in the final analysis. 33.3% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units. 44.2% had hypertension, 26.1% had diabetes, and 7.1% a chronic respiratory disease. 55% of patients underwent respiratory support (36% IMV, 62% NIV and 2% CPAP). Without considering a study with the highest number of patients treated with NIV (n=96729), prevalence of NIV and CPAP use was 12.5% and 13.5% respectively. Globally, invasive and non-invasive approaches were heterogeneously applied. In-hospital mortality was 33.7%, and IMV-related mortality was 72.6% (range: 4.3%-99%). Specific mortality in patients treated with CPAP or NIV was available for 53% of studies, and was 29% (range: 7.2%-100%). The median length of hospital stay was 13 days (range: 6-63). The most frequent hospital-related complication was acute kidney injury being reported in up to 55.7% of enrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS Global employment of respiratory supports and related outcomes are very heterogeneous. The most frequent respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is IMV, while NIV and CPAP are less frequently and equally applied, the latter especially in Europe, while data on NIV/CPAP-related mortality is often under-reported.

Aims: To determine noncommunicable disease (NCD), clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Isfahan, Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: This multicentric retrospective observational study was performed on all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Isfahan from 17 February to 6 April 2020. We recruited 5055 patients. Data on clinical course and comorbid NCDs such as hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were collected. Statistical analyses were done by Mann-Whitney U, x2 and logistic regression tests using Stata version 14. Results: DM and hypertension were the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with positive and negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of mortality-associated factors was significant for DM [1.35 (1.07-1.70)], CHD [1.58 (1.26-1.96)], CRD [2.18 (1.58-3.0)], and cancer [3.55 (2.42-5.21)]. These results remained significant for cancer after adjustment for age, sex and clinical factors. Among patients with positive RT-PCR, death was significantly associated with CRD and cancer, while this association disappeared after adjustment for all potential confounders. There was a significant association between NCDs and higher occurrence of low oxygen saturation, mechanical ventilation requirement and intensive care unit admission after adjustment for age and sex. Conclusion: The pre ence of NCDs alone did not increase mortality in patients with COVID-19, after adjustment for all potential confounders including clinical factors.","output":"Noncommunicable disease, clinical course and COVID-19 prognosis: results based on I-CORE Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-world evidence (RWE) is derived from real-world data (RWD) sources including electronic health records, claims data, registries (disease, product) and pragmatic clinical trials.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the need to identify genetic risk factors for susceptibility to this serious illness has emerged. Host genetic factors, along with other risk factors may help determine susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. It is hypothesized that the ACE2 gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a genetic risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and is required by the virus to enter cells. Together with ACE2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) also play an important role in disease severity. Evaluating the role of genetic variants in determining the direction of respiratory infections will help identify potential drug target candidates for further study in COVID-19 patients.

Recent works in manipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic concepts.

Among the mechanisms potentially involved in the hyperinflammatory state, we focused on the unfolded protein response, because the IRE1-XBP1 branch can be activated as result of the endoplasmic reticulum stress produced by the overwhelming synthesis of viral components and synergizes with Toll-like receptor signaling to induce cytokine expression. Viral RNA may trigger the IRE1-XBP1 branch via TLR7/8 activation and like TLR2 and TLR4 may underpin cytokine expression trough XBP1 splicing (sXBP1). The expression of IL1B, IL6, and TNF mRNA in bronchoalveolar aspirates (BAAs) were higher in COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation and intubation who showed sXBP1. The scrutiny of monocytic/macrophagic markers during active infection showed a reduction of those involved in antigen presentation and survival, as well as the IFN stimulated gene MX1. These changes reverted after infection tests turned negative. In contrast, the expression of the mRNA of the serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in S protein priming showed a high expression during active infection. TLR8 mRNA showed an overwhelming expression as compared to TLR7 mRNA, which suggests the presence of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In vitro experiments in MDDCs activated with ssRNA40, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) like SARS-CoV-2 RNA, induced sXBP1 and the expression of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF at mRNA and protein levels.

The primary outcome was duration from treatment to clinical recovery. Secondary outcomes were disease progression and persistent COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among 556 screened patients, 400 were enrolled and 363 completed follow-up. The mean patient age was 40 years, and 59% were men. The median recovery time was 7 (4-10, treatment group) and 9 (5-12, placebo group) days (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.90).

RESULTS Findings suggest that the people with disabilities' choice to seek healthcare services or not, as well as the quality of intervention provided by primary healthcare providers, are influenced by three types of barriers: cultural beliefs or attitudinal barriers, informational barriers, and practical or logistical barriers. CONCLUSION In order to achieve full health coverage at acceptable quality for people with disabilities, it is necessary not only to consider the different barriers, but also their combined effect on people with disabilities and their households. It is only then that more nuanced and effective interventions to improve access to primary healthcare, systematically addressing barriers, can be designed and implemented. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION People with disabilities in both high income and low- and middle-income country settings are more likely to experience poorer general health than people without disabilities. Barriers to accessing primary healthcare services for people with disabilities result from a complex and dynamic interacting system between attitudinal and belief system barriers, informational barriers, and practical and logistical barriers. Given primary healthcare is often the initial point of contact for referral to specialty care and rehabilitation services, it is crucial for people with disabilities to access primary healthcare services in order to get appropriate referrals for such services, specifically rehabilitation as appropriate. To achieve full health coverage at acceptable quality for people with disabilities, starting with primary healthcare, it is necessary for healthcare stakeholders, including rehabilitation professionals, to consider the combined and cumulative effects of the various barriers to healthcare on people with disabilities and their families and develop an understanding of how healthcare decisions are made by people with disabilities at the personal and the household level.","output":"Barriers to accessing primary healthcare services for people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries, a Meta-synthesis of qualitative studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Exercise rehabilitation programmes, traditionally involving supervised exercise sessions, have had to rapidly adapt to virtual delivery in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to minimise patient contacts In the absence of an effective vaccine, the pandemic is likely to persist in the medium term and during this time it is important that the feasibility and effectiveness of remote solutions is considered We have previously established the feasibility of the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer (ReStOre) intervention - a face to face multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer survivors This study will examine the feasibility of a virtually delivered 12-week multi-component ReStOre@Home programme","output":"ReStOre@Home: Feasibility study of a virtually delivered 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for survivors of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer - study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mentha arvensis L., M. citrata L., and M. spicata L.

New strategies to prevent SSIs would thus have a huge impact, also in light of increasing global rates of antimicrobial drug resistance. Considering the indispensable role of innate immune cells in host defense in surgical wounds, enhancing their function may represent a potential strategy for prevention of SSIs. Trained immunity is characterized by metabolic, epigenetic, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. These functional changes take place at multiple levels, namely, at the level of bone marrow precursors, circulating innate immune cells, and resident tissue macrophages. Experimental studies have shown that induction of trained immunity can protect against various infections. Increasing evidence suggests that it may also lower the risk and severity of SSIs. This may occur through several different mechanisms. First, trained immunity enhances local host defense against soft tissue infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of SSIs. Second, training effects on nonimmune cells such as fibroblasts have been shown to improve wound repair. Third, trained immunity may prevent or reverse the postoperative immunoparalysis that contributes to risk of infections following surgery. There are multiple approaches to inducing trained immunity, such as vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine, topical administration of -glucan, or treatment with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod.

Firstly, oxalic acid is used to dissolve Li and precipitate the other three metals in oxalate forms. It is found that under the optimal condition, about 98% of the Li is dissolved, and on average 93% of the other three metals are transformed to precipitated oxalates. The oxalates are then transformed to NiOMn2O3Co3O4 by being calcinated at 723 K under atmospheric environment. The selective recovery of NiOMn2O3Co3O4 can be achieved by using H2SO4 under three different conditions. The first step is to use H2SO4 to selectively dissolve CoO from the Co3O4. Then the combination of H2SO4 and ultrasound is adopted to dissolve NiO, during which the ultrasound destroys the surficial oxide film on the NiO. Afterwards, the Mn2O3 is transformed to MnO2 and Mn2+ in heated H2SO4. The Co, Ni and Mn ions are dissolved in a sequence, which facilitates their separation and recovery.

We aimed to systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges' g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755. FINDINGS: We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20C35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges' g 060 [95% CI 045C075]; Hedges' g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 054 [035C073]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I(2)=74% [95% CI 60C83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high. INTERPRETATION: Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs.

For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

In spite of this, investigations of the molecular pathogenesis for many HCPs have been limited to gross pathological changes in animal models or global analysis of gene expression. Further, questions remain regarding the ability of animal models of disease to recapitulate human molecular pathogenesis or act as predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, it is likely that medical countermeasure development for HCPs will rely on identifying therapeutic targets that are uniquely modulated during HCP infection. It is also appreciated that many cellular processes can be regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through phosphorylation events. Cellular kinases, individually or collectively (the kinome), play critical roles in regulating complex biology, underlie various malignancies, and represent high-priority drug targets. The growing interest in kinases in both basic and translational research has driven efforts to develop technologies that enable characterization of phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. To this end, enhanced technical capabilities at the IRF-Frederick provide the unique capability for characterizing host responses to HCP insult during the course of infection and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Systems kinomics for characterizing host responses to high-consequence pathogens at the NIH/NIAID Integrated Research Facility-Frederick"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fruit shape is one of the most important quality traits of pepper (Capsicum spp.) and is used as a major attribute for the classification of fruit types. Wide natural variation in fruit shape exists among the major cultivated species Capsicum annuum, allowing the identification of several QTLs controlling the trait. However, to date, no genes underlying fruit shape QTLs have been conclusively identified, nor has their function been verified in pepper. We constructed a mapping population from a cross of round- and elongated-fruited C. annuum parents and identified a single major QTL on chromosome 10, termed fs10, explaining 68 and 70% of the phenotypic variation for fruit shape index and for distal fruit end angle, respectively. The QTL was mapped in several generations and was localized to a 5 Mbp region containing the ortholog of SlOFP20 that suppresses fruit elongation in tomato. Virus-induced gene silencing of the pepper ortholog CaOFP20 resulted in increased fruit elongation on two independent backgrounds. Furthermore, CaOFP20 exhibited differential expression in fs10 near-isogenic lines, as well as in an association panel of elongated- and round-fruited accessions. A 42-bp deletion in the upstream region of CaOFP20 was most strongly associated with fruit shape variation within the locus. Histological observations in ovaries and fruit pericarps indicated that fs10 exerts its effect on fruit elongation by controlling cell expansion and replication. Our results indicate that CaOFP20 functions as a suppressor of fruit elongation in C. annuum and is the most likely candidate gene underlying fs10.","output":"Pepper Fruit Elongation Is Controlled by Capsicum annuum Ovate Family Protein 20"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency with a negative impact on mental health. Healthcare workers are one of the most vulnerable groups to psychological stress in pandemics especially COVID-19. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed depression, stress, and coping among a sample of Egyptian physicians using an electronic survey. It included demographic data; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21); and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). RESULTS: We found that the majority of the sample were females (61.2%), in medical specialties (51.2%), and living with vulnerable family members (92.4 %). The majority (63%) suffered from severe or extremely severe depression, 77.6% had extremely severe anxiety, and 72% suffered from stress. BRCS showed that only 17.1% had high resilient coping. Female physicians had significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores of DASS than male physicians (p = 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). The anxiety scale was significantly higher in those with chronic diseases (p = 0.040) while the stress scale was lower significantly in those with higher academic degree (p = 0.034). Age had a significantly negative correlation with DASS anxiety (p = 0.031) and stress scores (p = 0.037). The BRCS score had a significantly negative correlation with the depression, anxiety, and stress scales of DASS (p = 0.018, 0.014, and 0.007 respectively).

Periodontitis is a polymicrobial and multifactorial disease involving both host and environmental factors. Tissue destruction is primarily associated with hyperresponsiveness of the host resulting in release of inflammatory mediators. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in bacterial stimulation and tissue destruction. In addition, these cytokines are thought to underlie the associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions. Current research suggests that increased release of cytokines from host cells, referred to as the cytokine storm, is associated with disease progression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An intersection between periodontitis and pulmonary disease is biologically plausible. Hence, we reviewed the evidence linking COVID-19, cytokines, and periodontal disease.

This study evaluated a virtual model of care in acromegalic patients. Methods: We recruited 78 acromegalic patients, 65% female, median age 63 years. Outpatient management was remodeled to simplify access to care by (1) adoption of virtual meetings; (2) collection of blood samples at home; (3) abolishment of printed prescription and provision of electronic files directly to central pharmacy; and (4) drugs delivered to patients' home. Patients and physicians filled electronic surveys 48 h after each consultation. Results: The patients expressed satisfaction with convenience (91.1%), decreased wait time (85.1%), and saving money (79.2%) compared to face-to-face visits. Most patients felt supported by the medical team (89.1%) and kept the prescriptions updated (84.8%). The physicians reported resolutive appointments in 92.2% of cases, despite longer time to reach the patients and subsequent calls to complement missing information. Satisfaction and patient-provider relationship were maintained during the study, but the choice for virtual appointment for the next appointment fell from 78.7% to 34.8% after 6 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in 13% of patients, mostly mild and moderate manifestations. Conclusion: Telemedicine is a tool for medical care in underserved populations, feasible even in low-income countries. This study suggests that it is difficult to sustain exclusive remote care for more than 6 months.

Source credibility and, to an extent, authenticity have been widely studied in marketing and communications but have not yet been considered in the context of nutrition or health communication. Thus, an investigation into the factors that impact perceived source and message credibility and authenticity is of interest to inform health communication on SM. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the factors that impact message and source credibility (which includes trustworthiness and expertise) or authenticity judgments on SM platforms to better inform nutrition science SM communication best practices. METHODS A total of 6 databases across a variety of disciplines were searched in March 2019. The inclusion criteria were experimental studies, studies focusing on microblogs, studies focusing on healthy adult populations, and studies focusing on either source credibility or authenticity. Exclusion criteria were studies involving participants aged under 18 years and clinical populations, gray literature, blogs, WeChat conversations, web-based reviews, non-English papers, and studies not involving participants' perceptions. RESULTS Overall, 22 eligible papers were included, giving a total of 25 research studies. Among these studies, Facebook and Twitter were the most common SM platforms investigated. The most effective communication style differed depending on the SM platform. Factors reported to impact credibility included language used online, expertise heuristics, and bandwagon heuristics. No papers were found that assessed authenticity. CONCLUSIONS Credibility and authenticity are important concepts studied extensively in the marketing and communications disciplines; however, further research is required in a health context.

Users of these platforms are predominantly teenagers and young adults, who increasingly spend time socializing online rather than offline. This shift to online behavior can be a double-edged sword when coping with difficult periods in life such as relationship issues, the death of a loved one, or job loss. On the one hand, platforms such as Twitch offer pleasure, distraction, and relatedness with others to help with coping, and the increased sense of anonymity and control could stimulate self-disclosure. However, the prevalence of trolling and memes may also discourage people from opening up, and relationships that are built online-especially those with microcelebrity streamers-could be perceived as more meaningful than they actually are. To create a deeper understanding of Twitch as a new media platform embedded in game culture, and how users perceive its potential as a coping mechanism, we have conducted a first exploration by means of a survey. The questions focused on general Twitch behavior, the difficult period in life, and the role of Twitch during this period. It was distributed online among people who considered themselves active Twitch users, and who had gone through a difficult period. Eighty-four participants completed the entire survey. The majority of participants indicated that Twitch helped them cope, and that it became a larger part of their lives during the difficult period compared to regular viewing. Recurring themes were the entertainment, distraction, and sense of community Twitch offers. Viewing behavior during difficult periods appears to remain largely the same in terms of the streamers that are watched, although time spent viewing increases, and there is a change toward more time spent actively watching rather than having the stream on in the background.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes diarrhea in piglets with an age-dependent decrease of severity. RESULTS: We used 60 weaned piglets that were divided into three groups to evaluate the effect of different Zn levels added to a conventional diet (50 mg Zn/kg diet, Zn(low), control group). The other groups received the diet supplemented with ZnO at final concentrations of 150 mg Zn/kg diet (Zn(med)), or 2,500 mg/kg diet (Zn(high)). Oral challenge infection with TGEV was performed when the pigs had been fed for 1 week with the respective diet. Half of the piglets of each group were sacrificed at day 1 and 18 after challenge infection. Fecal consistency was improved and body weights increased in the Zn(high) group when compared to the other groups, but no direct effect of Zn concentrations in the diet on fecal TGEV shedding and mucosal immune responses was detectable. However, in the Zn(high) group, we found a prevention of villus atrophy and decreased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of jejunal epithelium. Furthermore, pigs receiving high Zn diet showed a down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-, oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), Zn transporter SLC39A4 (ZIP4), but up-regulation of metallothionein-1 (MT1), as well as the Zn transporters SLC30A1 (ZnT1) and SLC30A5 (ZnT5). In addition, forskolin-induced chloride secretion and epithelial resistance were controlled at a physiological level in the Zn(high) but not the other groups. Finally, in the Zn(high) group, we documented an earlier and higher systemic TGEV-specific serum antibody response.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to assess the research on the use of blockchain technology for patient care and the associated challenges and to provide a research agenda for future research. METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We queried the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed research articles published up to December 2019 that examined the implementation of blockchain technology in health care settings. We identified 800 articles from which we selected 70 empirical research articles for a detailed review. RESULTS: Blockchain-based patient care applications include medical information systems, personal health records, mobile health and telemedicine, data preservation systems and social networks, health information exchanges and remote monitoring systems, and medical research systems. These blockchain-based health care applications may improve patient engagement and empowerment, improve health care provider access to information, and enhance the use of health care information for medical research. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain health information technology (HIT) provides benefits such as ensuring data privacy and security of health data, facilitating interoperability of heterogeneous HIT systems, and improving the quality of health care outcomes. However, barriers to using blockchain technology to build HIT include security and privacy vulnerabilities, user resistance, high computing power requirements and implementation costs, inefficient consensus algorithms, and challenges of integrating blockchain with existing HIT. With 51% of the research focused on medical information systems such as electronic health record and electronic medical record, and 53% of the research focused on data security and privacy issues, this review shows that HIT research is primarily focused on the use of blockchain technologies to address the current challenges HIT faces.

The purpose of this study is to determine how emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians and agencies in North Carolina have been utilized in these vaccination efforts.Methods: This retrospective survey was sent to EMS medical directors and EMS system administrators for all 100 county EMS systems in North Carolina. Participation was voluntary, and survey questions asked about the contribution of EMS systems to vaccination efforts, the levels of EMS clinicians being utilized, the activities carried out by those clinicians, and any identifiable barriers to EMS involvement in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.Results: Ninety-eight of the 100 counties in North Carolina responded to the survey, with 88 contributing to vaccination efforts in the communities. Reasons cited by the 10 counties for not being involved in vaccination efforts include: county health departments not needing assistance (two counties), vaccine hesitancy amongst clinicians and the politicization of COVID (three counties), inadequate staffing (one county), and the presence of \\"robust vaccination clinics\\" in the community (one county). An additional 12 counties listed staffing shortages as limiting their vaccination efforts. Among the counties supporting vaccine efforts, activities included planning and logistics (54 counties), non-medical roles (38 counties), vaccine preparation (35 counties), medical screening pre-vaccination (41 counties), vaccine administration (74 counties), medical observation post-vaccination (79 counties), and home vaccinations (53 counties).

In this paper, a new probability model (FEW) is suggested which is designed to evaluate the death rates in a Population. Various statistical properties of FEW have been screened out in addition to the parameter estimation by using the maximum likelihood method (MLE). Furthermore, to delineate the significance of the parameters, a simulation study is conducted.

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone to reduce thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. Considering the risk of hepatotoxicity in patients with severe COVID-19 as well as the risk of drugCdrug interactions, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and bleeding, the ANIBAL protocol was developed to facilitate the anticoagulation approach at discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization. However, since the publication of the original algorithm, relevant changes have occurred. First, treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia has been modified with the use of dexamethasone or remdesivir during the first week in patients that require oxygen therapy, and of dexamethasone and/or tocilizumab or baricitinib during the second week in patients that necessitate supplementary oxygen or with a high inflammation state, respectively. On the other hand, metabolic syndrome is common in patients with AF as well as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and this could negatively impact the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, including high transaminase levels in patients treated with immunomodulators. The EHRA guidelines update also introduce some interesting changes in drugCdrug interaction patterns with the reduction of the level of the interaction with dexamethasone, which is of paramount importance in this clinical context. Considering the new information, the protocol, named ANIBAL II, has been updated.

Overall economic conditions can be explained through macroeconomic indicators as CPI, PPI, stock market indices, and unemployment rate. Construction industry's output can be interpreted from indicators as the country's GDP from construction. In Egypt, while Covid-19 impact has hit the economy, the overall GDP growth rate has dropped for the first time in nine years from 5% to -1.7%, while the GDP from construction has not been significantly affected presenting high resiliency. This research aims to propose a neural networks model to predict construction industry's resilience, explained through GDP from construction, using lagged macroeconomic indicators as predictors. Granger causality test is utilized to identify which macroeconomic indicators can be the leading indicators of the GDP from construction up to three quarters ahead. Data in Egypt from June 2008 to December 2020 are used as the study domain. Results show that although long term correlation exists, construction industry in Egypt can be classified as a resilient one. Such an approach can be applied on global markets providing the ability to predict resilience of an industry during economic shocks and unstable times, which would better prepare governments, investors, and shareholders.","output":"Prediction of Egypt's Construction Industry Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of personalized and home-based speech therapy on quality of life, intelligibility, and social participation for people with Parkinsons disease (PD) who have a reduced intelligibility of speech. BACKGROUND: Speech problems in PD have a profound negative impact on social interaction and quality of life. Evidence for speech therapy in PD is growing, but more work remains needed to explore its full potential. Efficacy exists for highly intensive standardized speech treatment programs, but not all patients can comply with this rather intense intervention, especially the more severely affected ones. Here, we aim to study the effectiveness of personalized and home-based (remote) speech therapy in PD on quality of life and speech. The intervention will be supported by a dedicated speech training app. We expect that this approach will improve speech intelligibility and quality of life in patients irrespective of disease stage. METHODS: We will perform a single blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing 8 weeks of speech therapy to no intervention using a waiting list design. A total of 215 PD patients with problems in intelligibility will be recruited by 12 highly experienced speech therapists. All patients will be measured at baseline and after 8 weeks (primary endpoint). Additionally, the experimental group will be re-assessed one more time, after a wash-out period of 24 weeks. The control group will receive deferred treatment after 8 weeks, but without additional follow-up assessments. Our primary outcome is quality of life (as measured with PDQ-39). Secondary outcomes include speech and voice quality, intelligibility, severity of voice and speech complaints, and caregiver burden. RESULTS: The inclusion of participants has started on March 1, 2019, and is expected to be finalized on April 1, 2021. We expect to have the first results in January 2022. CONCLUSIONS: We will investigate the effectiveness of speech therapy in PD. Particular strengths of our study include a randomized and single-blinded design, the personalized treatment approach, the inclusion of PD patients irrespective of disease stage or severity of the speech complaint, the long-term follow-up, the adequate power, and the use of a patient-relevant primary endpoint. This will allow us to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of personalized and remote speech therapy for PD patients in all disease stages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT03963388.

To understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S. conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one, the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our methodology can be applied to other countries and has the potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as well.

Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may give the policy makers to make informed decisions. Hence, this study aimed to make a quick assessment of KAP of people in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1837 responses across Bangladesh. However, 1589 completed responses were included in statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores, their interrelations with socio-demographic variables. The overall KAP is poor with only 10% of the respondents showed good knowledge with parallel attitudes and practices. Socio-demographic factors have strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP score is evident in female over male respondents, among aged (45 years and above) over younger respondents and among retired and homemakers above students and public service holders. The study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to gain public confidence and arrest more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures.

Therefore, streamlined and efficient nanopore-sequencing protocols need to be developed and optimized for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification, in particular for smaller hospital laboratories with lower throughput. Results: We adapted and simplified existing workflows using the midnight 1,200 bp amplicon split primer sets for PCR, which produce tiled overlapping amplicons covering almost all of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Subsequently, we applied the Oxford Nanopore Rapid barcoding protocol and the portable MinION Mk1C sequencer in combination with the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline. We tested the simplified and less time-consuming workflow on confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from clinical routine and identified pre-analytical parameters, which may help to decrease the rate of sequencing failures. Duration of the complete pipeline was approx. 7 hrs for one specimen and approx. 11 hrs for 12 multiplexed barcoded specimens. Conclusions: The adapted protocol contains less processing steps.

Participants reported how much physical activity they had performed in the last 7 days. Multiple linear regressions were performed for physical activity and sitting time. RESULTS: Physical activity was not associated with employment status. An interaction effect between hours worked and employment status was found for sitting time. CONCLUSIONS: Employment status was not related to physical activity; however, it did affect the amount of time spent sitting, with nonessential employees sitting more and working more hours than essential employees. Because greater amounts of daily total sitting time have been associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, it is important that increased sitting time be attenuated by greater physical activity.","output":"Relationship Between Employment Status, Reported Physical Activity, and Sitting Time During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physician fatigue, also known as burnout, is a highly prevalent but often underrecognized result of workplace stressors.

The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and nsp3 was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (P < .05).

Effective communication regarding technical issues between disaster experts and the residents is key to averting such secondary impacts. However, misconceptions about scientific issues and mistrust in experts frequently occur even with intensive and sincere communications. This miscommunication is usually attributed to residents' conflicts with illiteracy, emotion, value depositions and ideologies. However, considering that communication is an interactive process, there are likely to be additional factors attributable to experts. This article aims to summarize the gaps in rationality between experts and residents observed after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to describe how residents perceived experts. There were discrepancies in the perception of 'facts', the perception of probability, the interpretation of risk comparison, what were included as risk trade-offs, the view of the disaster, whose behavior would be changed by the communication and whether risk should be considered a science. These findings suggest that there was a non-scientific rationality among residents, which often exercised a potent influence on everyday decision-making. It might not be residents but experts who need to change their behavior. The discrepancies described in this article are likely to apply to communications following any CBRNE disasters that affect people's lives, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our experiences in Fukushima may provide clues to averting mutual mistrust between experts and achieving better public health outcomes during and after a crisis.","output":"'Life communication' after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster: what experts need to learn from residential non-scientific rationality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the radiographic findings of hospitalized adult Filipino COVID-19 patients on serial chest x-ray imaging. METHOD: We performed a retrospective review of records and chest x-rays of eligible adult Filipinos with confirmed COVID-19 admitted from 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Demographics, clinical outcomes, and chest radiographic findings were recorded. Serial chest x-ray findings were correlated with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: From 144 adult patients (93 males and 51 females), a total of 785 chest x-rays were reviewed (144 baseline and 641 follow-up). The most common finding overall is ground-glass opacity. The most common distribution pattern is bilateral, patchy/diffuse involvement of the central/peripheral zones. In x-rays taken after the third admission day, reticular opacities become more common than consolidation. The radiographic extent score was higher for deceased patients compared to the survivors at Day 7-9 (6 vs 4.4, p-value = 0.0011), Day 10-12 (5.9 vs 4.3, p-value = 0.0079) and Day 13-15 (5.5 vs 4.1, p-value = 0.0297). The presence of endotracheal tubes (68% vs 7.5%, p-value < 0.001) and pleural effusion (70% vs. 36%, p-value = 0.0004) were higher among the deceased. Reticular opacities were more common for discharged patients (50% vs 30%, p-value = 0.0021). CONCLUSION: Ground-glass opacities with bilateral, patchy/diffuse involvement of the central/peripheral zones are the most common findings. The presence of endotracheal intubation, pleural effusion, and persistently elevated radiographic extent scores are typically seen in deceased patients.

Tools to identify patients suitable for community-based management are urgently needed. METHODS: We prospectively recruited adults presenting to two hospitals in India with moderate symptoms of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in order to develop and validate a clinical prediction model to rule-out progression to supplemental oxygen requirement. The primary outcome was defined as any of the following: SpO(2) < 94%; respiratory rate > 30 bpm; SpO(2)/FiO(2) < 400; or death. We specified a priori that each model would contain three clinical parameters (age, sex and SpO(2)) and one of seven shortlisted biochemical biomarkers measurable using commercially-available rapid tests (CRP, D-dimer, IL-6, NLR, PCT, sTREM-1 or suPAR), to ensure the models would be suitable for resource-limited settings. We evaluated discrimination, calibration and clinical utility of the models in a held-out temporal external validation cohort. RESULTS: 426 participants were recruited, of whom 89 (21.0%) met the primary outcome. 257 participants comprised the development cohort and 166 comprised the validation cohort.

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU assay, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell assays and flow cytometry assays were conducted to examine the impact of miR-1179 on HCC cells. The protein expression of NUAK2 was detected using Western blotting assay. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to reveal the association of miR-1179 with NUAK2. RESULTS: MiR-1179 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC specimens and cell lines compared to normal samples and cells. The miR-1179 overexpression inhibited HCC cell migration, invasion and proliferation through targeting NUAK2. Overexpression of NUAK2 can reverse the effect of miR-1179 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CONCLUSION: miR-1179 suppresses HCC developmen through targeting NUAK2.

Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500-1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: -0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: -0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: -0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","output":"Relation of Dietary Factors with Infection and Mortality Rates of COVID-19 across the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 infection has particularly affected older adults.

Sera of mice vaccinated with MVA-EBOV-GP were virus-neutralizing and MVA-EBOV-NP immunization readily elicited interferon--producing NP-specific CD8+ T cells. While mock-vaccinated mice succumbed to EBOV infection, all vaccinated mice survived and showed drastically decreased viral loads in sera and organs. In addition, MVA-EBOV-NP vaccinated mice became susceptible to lethal EBOV infection after depletion of CD8+ T cells prior to challenge.

Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China, respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.","output":"Distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic and correlation with population emigration from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Universal access to information for health professionals is a need to achieve health for all strategy.

Moreover, the number of deaths is going to increase over the next few months until the pandemic comes to an end, and a second wave has also been reported in few countries. Most interestingly, the death rate among certain populations from the same COVID-19 infection is highly variable. For instance, the European populations show a very high death rate, in contrast to the populations from Chinese ethnicities. Amongst all the closed cases with an outcome (total recovered + total died), the death rate in Italy is 13%, Iran is 6%, China is 5%, Brazil is 3%, The United States of America is 2%, India 2%, Israel is 1% as of October 08, 2020.

During the first phase of the pandemic wave in Italy, whilst there was insufficient information about the phenomenon and the strategies to safeguard the population against it, many categories of people, whose professions required constant contact with the public, were affected by the contagion. Aims: The literature has shown how religiousness can support the management of stress due to diseases and health risks. In relation to this, the current study wanted to investigate how priests managed the early stages of the pandemic. This work, therefore, aimed to investigate the psychological experiences related to the contagion and the eventual death of colleagues as well as the resilience strategies activated by the priests during the process. Participants: The research involved 12 Catholic priests, all male and aged between 42 and 63 years. They came from the same pastoral community in one of the regions in Northern Italy that were most affected during the first phase of the pandemic. Those ministers had been constantly in contact with the faithful of their parishes since the breakout of the virus. Methodology: A qualitative research design was adopted, and in-depth interviews were conducted. The dialogues aimed at investigating the deep, personal and relational experiences of the priests, together with their concerns and the tools they adopted to manage anxiety. The texts obtained from the interviews were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: The areas studied concerned the experiences of the participants during the lockdown, the implications of social distancing and lack of funeral rituality and, finally, the importance of prayer as a resilience factor.

We use bioinformatic tools for CTL epitope prediction to identify epitopes under immune pressure.

Based on the severity of COVID-19, we also identify HLA-alleles and epitopes that offer higher protectivity against severe disease in infected individuals. Finally, we shortlist a set of pressured and protective epitopes that represent regions in the viral proteome that are under higher immune pressure across SARS-CoV-2 variants due to the protectivity they offer.

Recombinant APE1 binds to KRAS promoter G4 structure with high affinity and promotes G4 folding in vitro. Knockdown of APE1 reduces MAZ transcription factor loading onto the KRAS promoter, thus reducing KRAS expression in PDAC cells. Moreover, downregulation of APE1 sensitizes PDAC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that PDAC patients' tissue samples have elevated levels of both APE1 and G4 DNA.

Exercise is pivotal to OA management, yet uptake by people with knee OA is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in Australia where there is typically no Government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee OA is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services. METHODS: This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30C45 min each) with a physiotherapist over 3 months for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as OA education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3 months and a secondary end-point of 9 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset. DISCUSSION: Findings will determine if video consultations with physiotherapists are non-inferior to traditional face-to-face consultations for management of people with knee OA.

However, such a validation has been usually based on the computation of certain features from the raw spatio-temporal trajectories extracted from OSN documents. Hence, there is a scarcity of validation studies that evaluate whether geo-tagged OSN data are able to measure the evolution of the mobility in a region at multiple spatial scales. For that reason, this work proposes a comprehensive comparison of a nation-scale Twitter (TWT) dataset and an official mobility survey from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics. The target time period covers a three-month interval during which Spain was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our results show that, within the uncertainties, the predicted AMRs of L/SMC-mass galaxies with similar star formation histories to the L/SMC follow the same relation as observations.

Hypertension (HT) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are the leading causes of HF. In Suriname, South-America, data on HF burden are lacking. The aim of this Suriname Heart Failure I (SUHFCI) study, is to assess baseline characteristics of HF admitted patients in order to set up the prospective interventional SUHF-II study to longitudinally determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive HF management program in HF patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of Thorax Center Paramaribo (TCP) discharge data from January 2013-December 2015. The analysis included all admissions with primary or secondary discharge of HF ICD-10 codes I50-I50.9 and I11.0 and the following variables: patient demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), # of readmissions, risk factors (RF) for HF: HT, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, and left ventricle (LV) function. T-tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Differences were considered statistically significant when a p-value <0.05 is obtained. RESULTS: 895 patients (1:1 sex ratio) with either a primary (80%) or secondary HF diagnosis were admitted. Female patients were significantly older (66.2  14.8 years, p < 0.01) at first admission compared to male patients (63.5  13.7 years) and the majority of admissions were of Hindustani and Creole descent. HT, DM and smoking were highly prevalent respectively 62.6%, 38.9 and 17.3%. There were 379 readmissions (29.1%) and 7% of all admissions were readmissions within 30 days and 16% were readmissions for 31-365 day. IHD is more prevalent in patients from Asian descendant (52.2%) compared to African descendant (11.7%). Whereas, HT (39.3%) is more prevalent in African descendants compared to Asian descendants (12.7%). There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, ethnicity, LV function and RFs between single admitted and readmitted patients. CONCLUSION: RF prevalence, ethnic differences and readmission rates in Surinamese HF patients are in line with reports from other Caribbean and Latin American countries. These results are the basis for the SUHF-II study which will aid in identifying the country specific and clinical factors for the successful development of a multidisciplinary HF management program.","output":"Heart Failure Hospitalizations and Risk Factors among the Multi-Ethnic Population from a Middle Income Country: The Suriname Heart Failure Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic heightened the psychosocial impact of a cancer diagnosis as patients face concerns about the risk of infection and serious disease and uncertainties about the impact on their treatment.

We also identify a potential RHIM in Nsp13. These two observations allow us to suggest a model in which Nsp13 may regulate Z-RNA-initiated RHIM-dependent cell death outcomes at two steps. The first step involves possible new ATP-independent Z-flipon helicase activity in Nsp13, which is distinct from the activity of the canonical A-RNA helicase. This activity unwinds/quenches nascent Z-RNAs, preventing their sensing by ZBP1. The second step involves RHIM-dependent inhibition of ZBP1, RIPK3 and/or RIPK1, preventing cell death downstream of Z-RNA sensing. Together the RHIM and Z-flipon helicase have the potential to alter the host response to the virus and the effectiveness of drugs targeting the NSP13 helicase.","output":"Z-RNA and the flipside of the SARS Nsp13 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, it is very important to put an emphasis on widely understood teamwork.

METHODS: Safety analyses are based on integrated clinical and laboratory data for all patients who received OCR in 11 clinical trials, including the controlled treatment and open-label extension (OLE) periods of the phase 2 and 3 trials, plus the phase 3b trials VELOCE, CHORDS, CASTING, OBOE, ENSEMBLE, CONSONANCE, and LIBERTO. For selected adverse events (AEs), additional postmarketing data were used. Incidence rates of serious infections (SIs) and malignancies were contextualized using multiple epidemiologic sources. RESULTS: At data cutoff (January 2020), 5,680 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) received OCR (18,218 patient-years [PY] of exposure) in clinical trials. Rates per 100 PY (95% confidence interval) of AEs (248; 246C251), serious AEs (7.3; 7.0C7.7), infusion-related reactions (25.9; 25.1C26.6), and infections (76.2; 74.9C77.4) were similar to those within the controlled treatment period of the phase 3 trials. Rates of the most common serious AEs, including SIs (2.01; 1.81C2.23) and malignancies (0.46; 0.37C0.57), were consistent with the ranges reported in epidemiologic data. DISCUSSION: Continuous administration of OCR for up to 7 years in clinical trials, as well as its broader use for more than 3 years in the real-world setting, are associated with a favorable and manageable safety profile, without emerging safety concerns, in a heterogeneous MS population. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This analysis provides Class III evidence that long-term, continuous treatment with OCR has a consistent and favorable safety profile in patients with RMS and PPMS.

Here we identify a pattern of imbalance marked by basal epithelial cell growth and differentiation that replaces normal airspaces in a mouse model of progressive post-viral lung disease due to Sendai virus. Single-cell and lineage-tracing technologies identify a distinct subset of basal epithelial stem cells (basal-ESCs) that extend into gas-exchange tissue to form long-term bronchiolar-alveolar remodeling regions. Moreover, this cell subset is selectively expanded by crossing a cell growth and survival checkpoint linked to the nuclear-localized alarmin IL-33 that is independent of IL-33-receptor signaling and instead connected to autocrine chromatin accessibility. This mechanism creates an activated stem-progenitor cell lineage with potential for physiological or pathological function. Thus, conditional loss of Il33 gene function in basal epithelial cells disrupts homeostasis of the epithelial barrier at skin and gut sites but also markedly attenuates post-viral disease in the lung based on down-regulation of remodeling and inflammation. We thereby identify a basal-ESC strategy to deploy innate-immune machinery that appears to overshoot the primordial goal of self-defense. The findings reveal new targets to stratify and correct chronic and often deadly post-viral disease.","output":"Basal-epithelial stem cells cross an alarmin checkpoint for post-viral lung disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced dramatic changes to the healthcare systems throughout the world.

METHODS: We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). RESULTS: The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P = 0.007).

While the breadth of emerging research has been instrumental in understanding and curbing the global pandemic in near real-time, unfortunately manuscripts with major methodological challenges have fallen through the cracks. In this perspective, we illustrate this issue in light of a recent manuscript by Piquero et al. (2020). In the study, a statistically significant association between stay-at-home orders and family violence was not detected; however, the authors widely disseminated a 12.5% increase in family violence offenses to a variety of media outlets. This negligent dissemination of inaccurate research findings has important implications for policy and the virus mitigation efforts, which might urge policymakers to terminate stay-at-home orders in an effort to reduce family violence and other social risk factors. Changes may ultimately result in more COVID-related deaths as stay-at-home orders are prematurely and inappropriately lifted to prevent purported injuries in the home. Therefore, the widespread propagation of these claims in the absence of scientific evidence of an increase has great potential to cause harm.","output":"Trends in Family Violence Are Not Causally Associated with COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders: a Commentary on Piquero et al."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS coronavirus main proteinase is a prime target for antiviral therapy.

The detection of B. cereus spores and SEs were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: CNS and B. cereus concentrations in milk from non-vaccinated mothers were higher than that from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy, but S. aureus did not differ. Prematurity did not affect B. cereus or staphylococci in human milk. S. aureus and CNS concentrations in human milk with the presence of B. cereus were higher than that with the absence of B. cereus. Viable B. cereus was present in 9.2% of raw human milk samples whereas SEs were not detected in any samples. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination during pregnancy and low concentration of staphylococci could reduce the risk of B. cereus in raw human milk.

Only a few anecdotal reports of neurological involvement have come out from India so far. Adverse neurological events following immunization (AEFI) were also reported. We present the neurological symptoms seen either in association with vaccination or COVID-19 infection during the second wave. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive COVID-19 patients admissions during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two tertiary health care centres in Kerala. Neurological symptoms two weeks prior or thirty days after a positive status of antigen or RTPCR was termed as COVID-19-Associated Neurological Disorders (CAND) and those with neurological symptoms within one month of COVID-19 vaccination was termed as Post-Vaccinal Neurological Disorders (PVND). RESULTS: During the study period, 1270 COVID-19 admissions were reported. We identified neurological symptoms in 42 patients (3.3%), of which 35 were CAND and 7 were PVND. Stroke was the most common (50%), followed by seizures and peripheral nervous system disorders (14.2% each). Encephalitis/demyelination (11.9%) and COVID-19-associated infections (9.5%) were also seen. CONCLUSION: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, CAND and PVND have been emerging. Association of some of these may be fortuitous; however it is worth mentioning as pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 affecting various organ systems still remain unclear.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional. METHODS Twenty-two healthy adults (12 men, 10 women) were tested for responses to tactile forces, using 30-mm 6-0, 5-0, and 4-0 nylon monofilaments to map sensation of the aryepiglottic (AE) fold, lateral pyriform sinus (PS), and medial PS bilaterally. The outcome measures were the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) and patient reported rating of perceptual strength. RESULTS Rates of triggered LAR response grew monotonically with increasing tactile force at a mean (SD) stimulus duration of 663 (164) msec across all three subsites. The AE fold and medial PS had similar profiles and were the most responsive, while the lateral PS was the least responsive. Low force (6-0) response rate was 14% for all subsites. High force (4-0) response rate was 91% for AE fold and medial PS, and 23% for lateral PS. The perceptual strength gradient was in the lateral to medial trajectory. CONCLUSION Normative data for LAR response rates to low, medium, and high stimulation forces will be useful to assess sensory dysfunction in a variety of laryngopharyngeal disorders, including aspiration, dysphagia, chronic cough, and spasmodic dysphonia. In turn, that information will guide the creation of innovative treatments. LAR response profiles to low and high force stimuli will inform the development of screening tools to diagnose laryngopharyngeal hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity conditions.

The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development.

METHOD: Review of the literature informed development of audit standards for Lithium prescribing. These included National Institute for Clinical Excellent (NICE) 2014 guidelines, The British National Formulary (2019) and Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines (2018). Data were collected retrospectively, using an audit-specific data collection tool, from clinical files of POA team caseload, aged 65 years or more and prescribed Lithium over the past one year. RESULT: At the time of the audit in February 2020, 18 patients were prescribed lithium, 67% female, average age 74.6 years. Of those prescribed Lithium; 50% (n = 9) had a depression diagnosis, 44% (n = 8) had bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and 6% (n = 1) had schizoaffective disorder. 78% (n = 14) of patients were on track to meet, or had already met, the NICE standard of 3-monthly serum lithium level. Lithium levels were checked on average 4.5 times in past one year, average lithium level was 0.61mmol/L across the group and 39% (n = 7) had lithium level within recommended therapeutic range (0.6-0.8mmol/L). 83% (n = 15) of patients met the NICE standards of 3 monthly renal tests, thyroid function test was performed in 89% (n = 16) and at least one serum calcium level was documented in 63% (n = 15). Taking into consideration most recent blood test results, 100% (n = 18) had abnormal renal function, 78% (n = 7) had abnormal thyroid function and 60% (n = 9) had abnormal serum calcium. Half (n = 9) were initiated on lithium by POA service and of these, 56% (n = 5) had documented renal impairment prior to initiation. Of patients on long term lithium therapy at time of referral (n = 9), almost half (n = 4) had a documented history of lithium toxicity. CONCLUSION: The results of this audit highlight room for improvement in lithium monitoring of older adults attending POA service. Furthermore, all patients prescribed lithium had impaired renal function, half had abnormal calcium and two fifths had abnormal thyroid function. This is an important finding given the associations between those admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and comorbid kidney disease and increased risk of inpatient death. Our findings highlight the need for three monthly renal function monitoring in older adults prescribed lithium given the additive adverse effects of increasing age and lithium on the kidney.

Physical distancing remains a common and effective infection-control policy to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic. Sarcopenia is known to be associated with impaired immunity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and life-space mobility (LSM) are potential strategies for minimizing the risk of sarcopenia. However, a physical distancing policy might jeopardize the practice of MVPA and LSM. The purposes of this study were to identify the prevalence of sarcopenia and examine the association between MVPA and LSM with sarcopenia in the community-dwelling oldest-old during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional and observational design. The study was conducted in 10 community centres for older people in Hong Kong during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (September to December 2020). Eligible participants were the oldest-old people aged 85 years, who were community-dwelling and had no overt symptoms of cognitive impairment or depression. Key variables included sarcopenia as measured by SARC-F, LSM as measured by a GPS built into smartphones, and MVPA as measured by a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+. Variables were described by mean and frequency. A multiple linear regression was employed to test the hypotheses. The dependent variable was sarcopenia and the independent variables included LSM and MVPA. RESULTS: This study recruited 151 eligible participants. Their mean age was 89.8 years and the majority of them were female (n = 93/151, 61.6%). The prevalence of sarcopenia was 24.5% (n = 37/151) with a margin of error of 6.86%. MVPA was negatively associated with sarcopenia in older people ( = ? 0.002, SE = 0.001, p = 0.029). However, LSM was not associated with sarcopenia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sarcopenia in the community-dwelling oldest-old population is high. MVPA is negatively associated with sarcopenia. LSM is unrelated to sarcopenia. Sarcopenia should be recognized and the oldest-old with sarcopenia should be accorded priority treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to characterise the frequency and timing of clinical features in the primary care setting prior to MM diagnosis. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Electronic health records data of approximately 17 million patients (2006C2016) within the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 years with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM), no history of solid tumours and 2 years registration in a primary care practice prior to MM diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features and symptoms including bone pain, skeletal-related events (SREs), investigation and confirmation of MM diagnostic CRAB criteria (hyperCalcaemia, Renal impairment, Anaemia, Bone lesions) during the 2 years prior to MM diagnosis; time between symptom manifestation and/or relevant investigation and diagnosis of MM. RESULTS: Among 2646 patients with NDMM, 47.5% had a bone pain record during the 2-year period prior to MM diagnosis, mainly affecting the back. Regardless of baseline bone pain, investigations for serum calcium level were used in 36.4% of patients prior to MM diagnosis, followed by haemoglobin (65.6%) or renal function (74.1%). Median (Q1, Q3) time from first-recorded bone pain to MM diagnosis was 220 (80, 476) days. Median (Q1, Q3) time from first-recorded hypercalcaemia, renal impairment or anaemia to MM diagnosis was 23 (12, 46), 58 (17, 254) and 73 days (28, 232), respectively.

The handling of any students activities lie in the collective processes of submitting the proposal, securing the budget, getting the approval, promoting and handling the event, collecting feedbacks, reporting and post-mortem discussion. The management of these activities has been a major concern with the involvement of over 100 student clubs that carry out more than 20 events per week that are vying for a budget. Acquiring the approval for the event proposal, tracking the running of the activities and reporting are some of the factors that created a backlog from the management aspect. These procedures require a physical approach. Therefore, an Interactive Student Activities Management System (iSAMS) was designed and developed through the Waterfall methodology as a one-stop centre to help the UiTMCM Student Affairs Division facilitate the management of the students activities. This web-based system is able to track, display and store all the activities information from the proposal application stage until the end which includes tracking of attendance, progress of the event, collecting feedback, reporting of completed activities, storing supporting documents and generating reports for administrative purposes. All of these are done and managed via a secure, online interface in the Student Affairs Division website without physical presence of the students and the administrators. Even though iSAMS is yet to be completely implemented, the study has great potential in the form of a holistic management of students co-curricular activities.

The temperature dependence of the crystal structures of two quinacridone polymorphs ( and ), along with the common variant 2,9-dimethylquinacridone, were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction and terahertz spectroscopy. These were then compared with solid-state density functional theory simulations of both structures and vibrations. X-ray patterns were collected at eight temperatures in the range 13-298 K and terahertz spectra at fifteen temperatures in the range 20-300 K.

It was found that some of the powder X-ray diffraction features in only -quinacridone (15.7, 19.7 and 31.2 at 13 K) underwent anomalous shifting with temperature change. We attribute this to the unique coplanar hydrogen bonding pattern of -quinacridone compared to the other solids, with the unusual diffraction peaks originating from crystallographic planes perpendicular to the a axis intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This observation coincides with a contraction of the a axis with heating and results from its relatively weak N-HO hydrogen bonds and significant C-HH-C repulsions.

Methods We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay panel, the FilmArray? pneumonia panel (FilmArray PP, BioFire Diagnostics), for detection of 35 respiratory pathogens and resistance determinants and compared the performance of the standard-of-care test in intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Results Among the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5C97.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0C98.4%). FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens. FilmArray PP detected 16 viral targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR. Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens. Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing. However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available. Consequently, the results of FilmArray PP might alter the antibiotic prescription in 40.7% of the patients. Conclusions FilmArray PP offers a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for lower respiratory tract infections.

Protective behaviors such as social distancing and mask-wearing have been shown effective at curbing infection rates. These practices are subject to individual perceptions of risk and responsibility. This study aimed to characterize the risk perceptions and protective behaviors of residents in a rural central Michigan region. Specifically, we examined whether individual risk status predicted protective behaviors and concern about the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were identified via medical records at participating clinics. The high-risk group was those with conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and was compared to healthy controls. Data were collected via phone survey. Participants were asked about their protective behaviors and level of concern about the ongoing pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients participated in the survey; 73 were high-risk acknowledgers, 29 were high-risk deniers, and 48 were healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the groups on level of concern regarding the pandemic or protective behaviors (P > .05). Compared to other comorbidities, obese people were significantly more likely to deny their risk (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high risk, whether acknowledged or denied, did not appear to significantly impact behaviors or concern. The high percentage of those at high risk who did not acknowledge this suggests many factors including a potential lack of patient education regarding their comorbidities, specifically, how their illness increases their risk of severe illness from COVID-19.","output":"Revelations from the Clinic: Protective Behaviors and Perceptions among People at High Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses are an essential tool for determining the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population especially when testing occurs after symptoms have developed and limited contact tracing is in place. The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","output":"Serological profiles of pan-coronavirus-specific responses in COVID-19 patients using a multiplexed electro-chemiluminescence-based testing platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population growth, climate change, and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic are imposing increasing pressure on global agricultural production. The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue throughout the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review.

We mapped frequency of use from January 2008 to December 2018. We then searched Factiva for print media articles on childhood vaccination and parents published in that period, searching separately for articles using and not using 'anti-vaxxer' and variants. We constructed a set of 85 articles that did, and 85 articles date-matched that did not use the term to make comparisons and conducted a frame analysis of each set. 'Anti-vaxxer' was absent in Australian media discourse 2008-2010, rising to a peak of 247 articles using the term at the height of legislative change in 2017. Parents were framed as: 1) deviant \\"others\\"; 2) ignorant and in need of informing; 3) vulnerable and in need of protection from anti-vaccination activists; 4) thoughtful, critical, informed, and in need of agency and respect; 5) entitled, privileged and selfish; and finally, 6) lacking access to vaccination, rather than being unwilling. Articles using 'anti-vax' terms were more likely to negatively characterise non-vaccinating parents, while articles not including this language were more likely to frame them as thoughtful or lacking access. This study clearly demonstrates strategic use of pejoratives in the Australian mass media around a time of pressure for legislative change and conflation of anti-vaccination activists with non-vaccinating parents.

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals' perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.","output":"Impact of Online Information on Self-Isolation Intention During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we review the use of Artificial Intelligence to provide intelligent dispute resolution support.

DESIGN: Multi-site cross-sectional. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We extracted data on 3,556 NH residents from 18 NH facilities in Ontario, Canada, who received at minimum, an admission and first-quarterly assessment with the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 between November 1, 2009, and October 31, 2017. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected MDS 2.0 data. The provision of a recent medical care visit by a physician (or authorized clinician) was assessed in the 14-day period preceding a residents first-quarterly MDS 2.0 assessment. We utilized best-subset multivariable logistic regression to model the adjusted associations between resident-level clinical factors and a recent medical care visit. RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred fifty nine (80.4%) NH residents had one or more medical care visits prior to their first-quarterly MDS 2.0 assessment. Six clinically relevant factors were identified to be associated with recent medical care visits in the final model: exhibiting wandering behaviours (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 C 1.63), presence of a pressure ulcer (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.05 C 1.78), a urinary tract infection (UTI) (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.06 C 2.18), end-stage disease (OR = 9.70, 95% CI 1.32 C 71.02), new medication use (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 C 1.57), and analgesic use (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 C 1.49). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that resident-level clinical factors drive the provision of medical care visits following NH admission. Clinical factors associated with medical care visits align with the minimum competencies expected of physicians in NH practice, including managing safety risks, infections, medications, and death.

The rationale behind the study was the lack of reference intervals for the XN analyzer cell population data (CPD) and functional parameters. METHODS Fresh fasting blood samples from 18,484 participants in the Dutch Lifelines study were analyzed using two automated XN analyzers. Structured health questionnaire data were used to select a subgroup of 15,803 apparently healthy individuals for inclusion in the reference population. The Latent Abnormal Values Exclusion (LAVE) approach was used to reduce the influence of latent diseases in the reference population on the resulting reference intervals. We applied analysis of variance to judge the need for partitioning of the reference intervals by sex or age. RESULTS We report reference intervals for 105 XN analyzer hematological parameters with and without applying LAVE. Sex-related partitioning was required for red blood cells, (RBC, RBC-O), hemoglobin (HGB, HGB-O), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte production index (RPI), and side scattered light intensity of the red blood cell population in the RET channel (RBC-Z). Partitioning for age was not warranted. Body mass index (BMI) and smoking had moderate influence on a minority of the parameters.

However, current triaging methods often have poor predictive performance, are based on variables that are expensive to measure, and lead to decisions that are sometimes hard to interpret. OBJECTIVEWe introduce two new classification methods that are able to predict COVID-19 mortality risk from the automatic analysis of routine clinical variables with high accuracy and interpretability. The classifiers, denominated SVM22-GASS and Clinical-GASS, leverage machine learning methods and clinical expertise, respectively. METHODSBoth classifiers were developed using a derivation cohort of 499 patients and were validated with an independent validation cohort of 250 patients. The cohorts included COVID-19 positive patients admitted to two hospitals in the Italian Province of Ferrara between March 2020 and June 2020 (derivation cohort) and between September 2020 and March 2021 (validation cohort). The potential predictive variables analyzed in this study included demographic, anamnestic, and laboratory data, retrieved with the patients consents from their electronic health records. The SVM22-GASS classifier is based on a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) with Radial Basis Function kernel (RBF). Importantly, the model uses only a subset of predictive variables that were automatically selected with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), while the RBF kernel is approximated with random feature expansions to reduce the computational requirements. The Clinical-GASS classifier is a threshold-based classifier that leverages the General Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Severity (GASS) score: a highly interpretable COVID-19-specific clinical score that has been recently shown to be more effective at predicting the COVID-19 mortality risk than standard clinical scores. RESULTSThe SVM22-GASS model was able to predict the mortality risk of the validation cohort with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.87 and an accuracy of 0.88 -- performing on par with influential classification methods that exploit variables derived from expensive analyses such as medical imaging. Furthermore, variable importance analyses showed that the model relies primarily on eight variables for its predictions: White Blood Cell Count, Lymphocyte Count, Brain Natriuretic Peptide, Creatine Phosphokinase, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Fibrinogen, PaO2/FiO2 Ratio, and High-Sensitivity Troponin I. Similarly, the Clinical-GASS classifier predicted the mortality risk of the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.77 and an accuracy of 0.78 -- on par with other established and emerging machine-learning-based methods. CONCLUSIONSOur results demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict the COVID-19 mortality risk using only routine clinical variables that can be readily collected in the very early stages of hospital admission. The classifiers have the potential to assist the clinicians in quickly identifying the patients mortality risk to optimally allocate both human and financial resources.","output":"Rapid assessment of COVID-19 mortality risk with GASS classifiers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To report epidemiological features, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections in comparison with other community acquired respiratory virus (CRV) infections in patients hospitalized for two consecutive years. METHODS: This was a cross\\\\sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. RESULTS: HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co\\\\detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV\\\\infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p = 0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p = 0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r = ?0.636, p < 0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r = ?0.036, p = 0.866).

They account for approximately 4 million deaths annually including children and adults and provide a greater disease burden than HIV and malaria. Among the common respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia are very common and can be life threatening if not treated properly. The causative agent of tuberculosis is the slow-growing bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while the causative agent of influenza is a segmented genome RNA virus. Pneumonia can be caused by a number of different microorganisms like bacteria, virus, and mycoplasma. In case of the entry of a pathogen in our body, the immune system gets activated, and the phagocytic cells try to eliminate it by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) inside the phagosome. These reactive species or respiratory bursts are sufficient to eliminate most of the pathogens, except a few. M. tuberculosis is one such microorganism that has evolved mechanisms to escape this respiratory burst-mediated killing and thus survive and grow inside the macrophages. Infection with M. tuberculosis leads to the destruction of macrophages and release of cytokines, which lead to prolonged immune activation and oxidative stress. In some cases, the bacilli remain dormant inside macrophages for a long time. Flu viruses infect the epithelial cells present in respiratory tract, and the infection site is dependent on the hemagglutinin protein present on their capsid. Destruction of epithelial cells promotes secretion of mucus and activation of immune system leading to the oxidative damage. Community-acquired pneumonia is more serious and difficult to treat. In all these infections, ROS/RNS are developed as a defense mechanism against the pathogen. Persistence of the pathogen for a long time would lead to the uncontrolled production of ROS/RNS which will lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage to the host. Administration of antioxidants along with conventional treatments can be useful in the elimination of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.","output":"Infectious Lung Diseases and Endogenous Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus which caused the COVID-19 pandemic and infected more than 10 million victims and resulted in over 500,000 deaths in 213 countries around the world. Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network. Moreover, differentially expressed genes of two available GSE were investigated and PPIs of SARS-CoV-2-human network, the human proteins of which were related to upregulated genes, were reported.","output":"Coronavirus-Human protein-protein interaction network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Fibromyalgia is a debilitating syndrome characterized by diffuse and chronic musculoskeletal pain and tender points in muscles and soft tissues.

A total of 42.4% were redirected or discharged at triage or following STT investigations. Overall 86.3% of patients were managed without a new patient F2F clinic appointment.

There is little evidence that neither patients nor GPs are significantly dissatisfied with this change in practice, with low rates of re-referral or complaint. It also does not appear patients come to harm or are mismanaged by this approach but may need longer term follow-up.

Healthcare providers use reliable and valid tools during the physical rehabilitation process to measure joint range of motion (ROM), assess functional mobility, guide decisions for skilled interventions, and progress a plan of care. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, both healthcare providers and patients benefited from mobile health technologies that have emerged, which can be used by patients in the home to monitor ROM and assist the healthcare provider in guiding the rehabilitation process when utilizing telehealth. Purpose The goal of this study was to investigate the reliability and concurrent validity of a smartphone application for obtaining goniometric measurements of forearm pronation and supination. Methods This study consisted of 83 participants that were recruited on a voluntary basis from an academic institution. An iPhone with the application Clinometer and a standard goniometer (SG) were utilized to obtain goniometric measurements of forearm pronation and supination. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to analyze intrarater reliability, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze concurrent validity. Scatterplots with regression lines were created to visually display the results. Results The smartphone demonstrated strong correlations for both pronation and supination (r = 0.71, P < .001;r = 0.73, P < .001). This study demonstrated overall good-excellent intrarater reliability and good concurrent validity for the smartphone application with a higher test-retest reliability in the measurement of forearm pronation compared to supination. Conclusions This study concludes that the reliability and concurrent validity of the smartphone was consistent with the SG for assessing forearm pronation and supination.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected tonsillitis or quinsy, aged 18 or over, and referred to ENT in secondary care were eligible for inclusion. Data was collected, using a standardised electronic case report form, relating to patient demographics, COVID-19 status, clinicians grade, assessment and interventions. Each case was followed-up for 10 days to assess predictors of unscheduled re-presentation after discharge direct from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 quinsy cases. 54.4% of tonsillitis cases and 45.3% of quinsy were discharged directly from the ED. 9.6% of tonsillitis and 10.3% of quinsy discharges re-presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% and 10.6% for those initially admitted. IV steroids were given to 67.0% of tonsillitis patients and 73.6% of quinsy. 77.2% of quinsy patients underwent drainage during their initial presentation, but there was no significant difference in re-presentation rate in those drained vs not-drained (p = 0.85). Univariable logistic regression showed no significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days.

At present, in the COVID-19 pandemic, such screening is often limited to isolated regions as determined by local governments. Screening of potentially infectious individuals should be conducted through coordinated national or global unified actions. Our current research focuses on using resources to conduct comprehensive national and regional regular testing with a risk rate based, algorithmic guided, multiple-level, pooled testing strategy. Here, combining methodologies with mathematical logistic models, we present an analytic procedure of an overall plan for coordinating state, national, or global testing. The proposed plan includes three parts 1) organization, resource allocation, and distribution; 2) screening based on different risk levels and business types; and 3) algorithm guided, multiple level, continuously screening the entire population in a region. This strategy will overcome the false positive and negative results in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and missing samples during initial tests. Based on our proposed protocol, the population screening of 300,000,000 in the US can be done weekly with between 15,000,000 and 6,000,000 test kits.

By reducing the risk of severe COVID-19, vaccination may indirectly improve the mental state. This study aims to assess the effects of vaccination on respondents mental well-being, their attitudes towards adherence to government recommendations limiting viral transmission, and to identify factors that may influence the decision to get vaccinated. The survey took the form of the authors own, fully voluntary, anonymous, online questionnaire. Standardised psychometric tools were used in the survey: Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). The survey involved 1696 respondents, the vast majority of whom were women, and were aged 18C29. The vaccination status was declared by 1677 respondents (98.9%), 430 (25.4%) of whom were vaccinated with at least one dose of vaccine, while 303 (17.9%) respondents were not only unvaccinated at all, and declared no intention to get vaccinated in the future. Fully vaccinated individuals were found to have lower levels of anxiety, higher MANSA scores and lower subjective anxiety about being infected with COVID-19 than those awaiting vaccination or those with an incomplete vaccination regimen (one dose). Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have the lowest sense of anxiety and fear of being infected and they have the lowest adherence to government recommendations limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination reduces the level of anxiety about being infected and anxiety due to COVID-19 disease in people from the immediate environment. Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have extreme attitudes that negate the pandemic as a whole, including the need for COVID-19 vaccination.

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, bilateral swaps of the conjunctiva in the lower fornices as well as nasopharyngeal swaps were collected in 1145 hospitalized asymptomatic patients of a tertiary eye care center. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for each swap to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Demographic data and potential risk factors for an isolated infection of the ocular surface were noted. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred eighty-eight (99.9%) of all 2290 tested eyes had negative results in the RT-PCR analysis of the conjunctival swabs.

AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not.

The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure which is crucial to the normal operation of the eukaryotic cell. Studying nucleolar trafficking signals is problematic as many nucleolar retention signals (NoRSs) are part of classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs). In addition, there is no known consensus signal with which to inform a study. The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Mutagenesis was used to delineate a novel eight amino acid motif that was necessary and sufficient for nucleolar retention of N protein and colocalize with nucleolin and fibrillarin. Additionally, a classical nuclear export signal (NES) functioned to direct N protein to the cytoplasm. Comparison of the coronavirus NoRSs with known cellular and other viral NoRSs revealed that these motifs have conserved arginine residues. Molecular modelling, using the solution structure of severe acute respiratory (SARS) coronavirus N\\\\protein, revealed that this motif is available for interaction with cellular factors which may mediate nucleolar localization.

With large-scale interpersonal communication, whether Chinese residents can maintain a high awareness of prevention and control and adhere to the use of masks during the Chinese New Year of 2021 is worth studying. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in China from February 4 to 26, 2021. A convenient sampling strategy was adopted to recruit participators. Participants were asked to fill out the questions that assessed the questionnaire on face mask use. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the mask-wearing behaviors of the public. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors affecting mask-wearing behaviors. Results: A total of 2,361 residents filled out the questionnaire.

To investigate this, we used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate a matrix of genetic correlations (r(gs)) for antisocial behavior (ASB), COVID-19, and various health and behavioral traits. After false-discovery rate correction, ASB was genetically correlated with COVID-19 (r(g) = 0.51; P = 1.54E-02) and 19 other traits. ASB and COVID-19 were both positively genetically correlated with having a noisy workplace, doing heavy manual labor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and genitourinary diseases. ASB and COVID-19 were both inversely genetically correlated with average income, education years, healthspan, verbal reasoning, lifespan, cheese intake, and being breastfed as a baby. But keep in mind that r(gs) are not necessarily causal. And, if causal, their prevailing directions of effect (which causes which) are indiscernible from r(gs) alone. Moreover, the SNP-heritability ([Formula: see text] ) estimates for two measures of COVID-19 were very small, restricting the overlap of genetic variance in absolute terms between ASB and COVID-19. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that those with antisocial tendencies possibly have a higher risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than those without antisocial tendencies.

In this review, we discuss the literature surrounding this apparent discrepancy in vitamin D signaling and compare vitamin D with known TRPV1 ligands with respect to their binding to TRPV1. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the notion that this novel vitamin D/TRPV1 axis may explain some of the beneficial actions of this vitamin in disease states where TRPV1 expression and vitamin D deficiency are known to overlap.

We were also able to examine frequencies with which polycistronic readthrough mRNAs were generated and to assess the length of the polyadenylated tails for each group of transcripts. We show that there is a general but non-linear decline in gene transcript abundance across the viral genome, as predicted by the model of RSV gene transcription. However, the decline in transcript abundance is not consistent. We show that the polyadenylate tails generated by the viral polymerase are similar in length to those generated by the host cells polyadenylation machinery and broadly declined in length for most transcripts as infection progressed. Finally, we observed that the steady state abundance of transcripts with very short polyadenylate tails is much less for N, SH and G transcripts compared to NS1, NS2, P, M, F and M2 which may reflect differences in mRNA stability and/or translation rates.","output":"Direct RNA sequencing of Respiratory Syncytial Virus infected human cells generates a detailed overview of RSV polycistronic mRNA and transcript abundance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As surges in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic have continued worldwide, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) has mutated, spawning several new variants, and impacting, to various degrees, transmission, disease severity, diagnostics, therapeutics, and natural and vaccine\\\\induced immunity.

SITES AND SAMPLE SIZE: The trial is aimed to recruit 454 infants over 3 years across tertiary level NICUs. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome includes an optimally positioned ETT, defined as an ETT tip between the upper border of the first thoracic vertebra and the lower border of the second thoracic vertebra. The outcome is assessed by a paediatric radiologist, who will be masked to the group assignment. Secondary outcomes are malpositioned ETT tips, pneumothorax, ETT repositioning, chronic lung disease, invasive ventilation days, and death. ANALYSIS: Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. The primary and categorical secondary outcomes will be compared using the (2) test. Adjusted risk ratios of outcomes will be calculated along with 95% CIs through multivariable logistic regression analysis, including covariates deemed biologically to influence the outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the PNU Research Ethics Board (20-0148) and the respective ethical review boards of the participating centres. The results will be disseminated through conference meetings, social media platforms, and publications in scientific journals.

Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world-and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","output":"Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees-An efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, customized bus (CB) is becoming an innovative model of the public transport system (PTS) in China This service provides an advanced, timely, personalized, and flexible responses to the demand of the PTS, especially of commuters Obviously, it could have an impact on public transport (PT) service For instance, CB services influence the customers' variety-seeking behavior, which results in changes of customer options in different periods Therefore, customers could be divided into different groups of preference In this paper, we construct a two-period Hotelling game model by variety-seeking behavior and service level The results show that, in the first stage, the departure frequency of CB and PT is influenced by variety-seeking behavior and service level In the second stage, departure frequency is influenced by service level only Next, although the departure frequency of bus impacts the changes of passenger ratios in different stages, service level appreciably impacts passenger number From customer surplus and social welfare, we find that adjustment of service level can increase social welfare, which means that CB and PT will reach an optimum effect The present work can provide a valuable reference to policymakers, practitioners, and others","output":"Operational strategy of customized bus considering customers variety seeking behavior and service level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publics actions will likely have a significant effect on the course of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The findings of the study confirms the individuals attitude as the most significant determinant of the intention to exchange, followed by level of awareness and norms, whereas perceived behavior control was found to be least important though significant.

For psychotic disorders, these issues were partly addressed in current versions, but additional modifications are thought to be needed. Changes should be evidence based. We reviewed categorical, modified-categorical, and continuum-based models versus factor-based models of psychosis. Factors are clusters of symptoms or single prominent aspects of illness. Consistent evidence from studies of the genetics, pathobiology, and clinical presentation of psychotic disorders all support an underlying structure of factors, not categories, as best characterizing psychoses. Factors are not only the best fit but also comprehensive, as they can encompass any key feature of illness, including symptoms and course, as well as determinants of risk or response. Factors are inherently dimensional, even multidimensional, as are the psychoses themselves, and they provide the detail needed for either grouping or distinguishing patients for treatment decisions. The tools for making factor-based diagnoses are available, reliable, and concordant with actual practices used for clinical assessments. If needed, factors can be employed to create categories similar to those in current use. In addition, they can be used to define unique groupings of patients relevant to specific treatments or studies of the psychoses. Lastly, factor-based classifications are concordant with other comprehensive approaches to psychiatric nosology, including personalized (precision treatment) models and hierarchical models, both of which are currently being explored.

The syndrome develops in the context of a probable or ascertained Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, but other possible etiologies should be ruled out for definitive diagnosis. On the clinical side, along with the multi-system involvement, myocarditis with heart failure and shock is the most striking feature. Capillary leak is another fundamental feature of MIS-C. In fact, shock and hemodynamic compromise in MIS-C can occur also in the absence of laboratory evidence of myocardial inflammation, with preserved cardiac function and rapid reversibility. Since the first observations of MIS-C patients, it was evident that there is a delay between the peak of adult cases of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and the MIS-C peak. Moreover, SARS-Cov2 isolation in children with MIS-C is not always possible, due to low viral load, while positive serology is far more commonly observed. These observations lead to the interpretation of MIS-C as a post-infectious disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of MIS-C is far from being elucidated, it is clear that it is a hyperinflammatory disease with a different inflammatory response as compared to what is seen in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that the disease shares some, but not all, immunological features with Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), Kawasaki Disease (KD), Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Different mechanisms have been hypothesized as being responsible, from molecular mimicry to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Some evidence has also been collected on the immunological profile of patients with MIS-C and their difference from COVID-19. This review is focused on critical aspects of MIS-C clinical presentation and pathogenesis, and different immunological profiles.

(Saururaceae; HC) has been long used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of inflammation diseases. Modern research has implicated inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a key regulator of the inflammatory process. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of HC on COX-2. We examined the effects of HC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin (PG) E(2) production, an indirect indicator of COX-2 activity, and COX-2 gene and protein expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages were employed as an in vitro model system. LPS-induced PGE(2) production was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and COX-2 protein expression was assessed by Western blot assay. RESULTS: The results showed that HC was able to inhibit the release of LPS-induced PGE(2) from mouse peritoneal macrophages (IC50 value: 44.8 g/mL). Moreover, the inhibitory activity of HC essential oil elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity (IC50 value: 30.9 g/mL). HC was also found to cause reduction in LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, but did not affect COX-1 expression. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and specific COX-2 inhibitor NS398 functioned similarly in LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest HC mediates inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity and can affect related gene and protein expression. HC works by a mechanism of action similar to that of NSAIDs.

Commission has positioned as one of the priority projects in the Euro?pean Research Area and one of the most significant panel studies in social sciences This paper aims to present the methodological profile of the SHARE study with a specific reference to the period since 2015 when Croatia joined it It also examines the process of SHARE study implementation in Croatia with a detailed presentation of modules and questions from the questionnaires in the sixth and seventh waves The specific purpose of this paper is to emphasise the content and research opportunities of the SHARE study for the Croatian scholarly community This paper highlights the specific aspects of the eighth wave of SHARE in which face-to-face interviewing has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a methodological turn has been made, i e face-to-face interviews have been replaced with a short CATI (telephone) survey called \\"SHARE Corona \\" As a panel study, SHARE collects data in waves, every two years since 2004, sup?ported by CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing) A SHARE interview is quite long, with an approximate duration of one hour Same respondents are inter?viewed in regular waves, but new respondents can be added to refresher samples New respondents help to maintain the core sample and deal with sample attrition However, SHARE invests significant efforts in recovering panel respondents who have participated in the previous waves The strategy to minimise the absence of panel respondents includes regular contact with respondents, i e panel care (send?ing birthday cards, season's greetings, brochures with selected SHARE results to re?spondents or providing incentives) The SHARE study relies on ex-ante harmonisa?tion and includes a core survey instrument that is common in all member countries Strict comparability is crucial Comparability is ascertained through identical ques?tion design, a careful translation process with external certification, an electronic survey instrument (CAPI, CASE CTRL starting from Wave 8), and common training procedures ascertained by a train-the-trainer programme In addition to the variety of electronic instruments, SHARE relies on several \\"physical\\" survey instruments, which are mainly used to obtain objective health measures These instruments in?clude dynamometers (to measure respondents' grip strength) and peak flow me?ters (to measure respondents' lung capacity) Besides, SHARE collects da a from the walking speed test and chair stand test, data on waist circumference, self-reported weight and height, and biomarkers from a sample of dried blood spots (HbA1c, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein and vitamin D) In the participating SHARE countries, the institutional conditions with respect to sampling are so different that a uniform sampling design for the entire project is infeasible Good sampling frames for the target population of 50+ individuals and households with at least one 50+ individual do not exist or cannot be used in all countries Most countries keep registers of individuals that enable stratification by age In some of them, these registers are maintained at a regional level In these cases, a two- or multi-stage design is needed, in which regions are sampled first, and then individuals are selected within these regions As a result, sampling designs used vary from a simple random selection of households to rather complicated multi-stage de?signs Taking into account the size of the population in each participating country, SHARE calculates weights to reduce the potential selection bias associated with non-response errors In the Croatian wave six, the sampling of potential respondents was based on probabilities from the administrative register of age-appropriate individu?als From the database of insured persons of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO), 4,990 persons born in 1963 and earlier were randomly selected Each person received an invitation letter for participation in the SHARE study in Croatia The response rate in SHARE wave six was 43 7% at the household level, while the indi?vidual response rate was 41 9% These rates resulted in 2,495 individual surveys con?ducted in 1,588 households in Croatia In all countries that had refresher samples, the response rate was 51 3% at the household level and 46 8% at the individual level The seventh SHARE wave, called SHARELIFE, was mainly retrospective, accomplishing a full EU coverage As a part of the seventh wave, a relatively small refresher sample was selected in Croatia i e 346 interviews were conducted in 234 households The minimum satisfactory response rate of 30% was achieved at the household level In Croatia, the retention rate of respondents in the seventh wave was 84 6%, which was the highest retention rate of respondents between waves six and seven In Slovenia, it was 82 9%, in Greece 82 8%, in Estonia 82 2%, in Belgium 70 4%, in France 64 9%, and in Italy 62% That retention rate in Croatia resulted in 2,062 SHARELIFE inter?views with an additional 101 end-of-life interviews (interviews about the last year of life of a deceased respondent) The sampling procedure for the refresher sample in wave eight in Croatia followed the standard phases of two-stage sampling Primary sampling units were polling stations selected based on a probability proportional to the number of voters aged 50+ at each polling station The sample was stratified by counties and by settlement size In the second phase, the gross sample of individuals aged 50 or older was selected randomly The representativeness of the sample was achieved by weighting a set of eight calibration variables (men and women in age groups 50C59, 60C69, 70C79, and 80+) Following the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across Europe, in March 2020, all SHARE countries suspended field surveys By that date, 1,279 panel interviews (including end-of-life interviews) and 835 refresher interviews had been collected in Croatia In response to the pandemic, the SHARE Central, in cooperation with national teams, created the SHARE Corona questionnaire, designed for a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), lasting about 20C25 minutes This survey, con?ducted in 27 European countries and Israel from June to August 2020, included panel respondents only The SHARE study is a prime example of a truly European research infrastructure that exists largely because of its European dimension It is crucial to point out that the data collected by the survey questionnaire are harmonised ex-ante across Europe, which significantly contributes to the improvement of international comparative re?search The main value of this project lies with the diversity of collected data, with each participating country contributing to this diversity with data on living condi?tions, health, pension and social policies Therefore, SHARE is much more than just a group of national surveys The SHARE study today faces a number of challenges, the most prominent ones being the retention of European coverage due to lack of fund?ing and the future method of surveying in the light of COVID-19 In Croatia, joining the SHARE study was marked by significant challenges Firstly, SHARE is the first longitudinal study on demographic ageing conducted in our country Secondly, the SHARE survey requires ample financial resources, so the size of the Croatian sam?ple had to be adjusted accordingly and to meet high scientific standards set by the SHARE study The third significant challenge that the SHARE research team faced were barriers to accessing the sampling framework Substantial efforts were under?taken to demonstrate that the SHARE study adheres to all ethical standards and regulations related to the protection of the personal data of respondents Another is?sue was the limited number of survey agencies in Croatia that can conduct demand?ing surveys of this type This was especially evident in the sixth wave, when certain logistical issues arose because the fieldwork phase started quite late (end of June 2015), leading to the stagnation of surveys in some parts of the country (Dalmatia, Istria) Difficulties related to the recruitment of interviewers and their withdrawal in the early stages of the survey required significantefforts during the last month of the

Here users can specify their information need as graph patterns for precise searches and structured overviews (by allowing variables in queries). But especially when considering textual sources that contain narrative information, i.e., short stories of interest, harvesting statements from them to construct knowledge bases may be a serious threat to the statements' validity. A piece of information, originally stated in a coherent line of arguments, could be used in a knowledge base query processing without considering its vital context conditions. And this can lead to invalid results. That is why we argue to move towards narrative information access by considering contexts in the query processing step.

M1-like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression. In contrast, M2-like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth. An imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation, such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors. We have found that plant-derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the M1-inducing cytokine IFN-gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to IL-4, a prototypical activator of the M2-like phenotype. Treatment of primary macrophages with rocaglates enhanced phagosome-lysosome fusion and control of intracellular mycobacteria. Thus, rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization toward the M1-like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type 1 and/or hyperactivation of type 2 immunity, e.g., chronic bacterial infections, allergies, and, possibly, certain tumors.","output":"Channeling macrophage polarization by rocaglates increases macrophage resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the prohibition of group-based exercise and the cancellation of sporting events. Evaluation of respiratory aerosol emissions is necessary to quantify exercise-related transmission risk and inform mitigation strategies. METHODS: Aerosol mass emission rates are calculated from concurrent aerosol and ventilation data, enabling absolute comparison. An aerodynamic particle sizer (0.54C20 m diameter) samples exhalate from within a cardiopulmonary exercise testing mask, at rest, while speaking and during cycle ergometer-based exercise. Exercise challenge testing is performed to replicate typical gym-based exercise and very vigorous exercise, as determined by a preceding maximally exhaustive exercise test. RESULTS: We present data from 25 healthy participants (13 males, 12 females; 36.4 years). The size of aerosol particles generated at rest and during exercise is similar (unimodal ~0.57C0.71 m), whereas vocalization also generated aerosol particles of larger size (i.e. was bimodal ~0.69 and ~1.74 m). The aerosol mass emission rate during speaking (0.092 ng s(?1); minute ventilation (VE) 15.1 L min(?1)) and vigorous exercise (0.207 ng s(?1), p = 0.726; VE 62.6 L min(?1)) is similar, but lower than during very vigorous exercise (0.682 ng s(?1), p < 0.001; VE 113.6 L min(?1)). CONCLUSIONS: Vocalisation drives greater aerosol mass emission rates, compared to breathing at rest. Aerosol mass emission rates in exercise rise with intensity. Aerosol mass emission rates during vigorous exercise are no different from speaking at a conversational level. Mitigation strategies for airborne pathogens for non-exercise-based social interactions incorporating vocalisation, may be suitable for the majority of exercise settings. However, the use of facemasks when exercising may be less effective, given the smaller size of particles produced.","output":"A comparison of respiratory particle emission rates at rest and while speaking or exercising"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has been accompanied by an extensive use of indicators, such as those related to COVID infections and deaths, but also a good number of COVID policy indicators.

The exposure was defined as any infection with influenza virus as a primary principal diagnosis for hospitalization, whereas the non-exposed control comprised hospitalizations for elective orthopedic surgery. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk for HHF within 12 months of hospital discharge comparing the exposed versus non-exposed groups. Results showed that influenza-associated hospitalization in the preceding 12 months was associated with increased risks for subsequent HHF in all age groups (all P <0.001). Of note, the 18-44 age group was found to have the highest elevated risk for HHF (adjusted odds ratio = 14.90, 95% confidence interval: 4.48, 49.58). In view of the relatively small number of subsequent HHF episodes in this age group, future studies are needed to confirm the elevated risk in this group and explore the role of age in the relationship between influenza-associated hospitalization and subsequent HHF.","output":"Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations and Risk for Subsequent Heart Failure Hospital Admissions: A 20-Year Territory-Wide Registry Study in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite an increase in the use of technology in undergraduate anatomy education, and the rising popularity of online anatomy courses at community colleges in the US, there have been no reports on the efficacy of augmented reality on anatomy education in this population.

While vaccines have proven instrumental in fighting SARS-CoV-2, their efficacy is challenged by vaccine hesitancy, novel variants and short-lasting immunity. Therefore, understanding and optimization of therapeutic options remains essential. Objectives We aimed at generating a deeper understanding on how currently used drugs, specifically dexamethasone and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses. Possible synergistic effects of both substances are investigated to evaluate combinatorial treatments. Methods By using two COVID-19 hamster models, pulmonary immune responses were analyzed to characterize effects of treatment with either dexamethasone, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody or a combination of both. scRNA sequencing was employed to reveal transcriptional response to treatment on a single cell level. Measurements and main results Dexamethasone treatment resulted in similar or increased viral loads compared to controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment alone or combined with dexamethasone successfully reduced pulmonary viral burden. Dexamethasone exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects and prevented fulminant disease in a severe COVID-19-like disease model. Combination therapy showed additive benefits with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory potency. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed dampened inflammatory cell recruitment into lungs upon dexamethasone treatment and identified a candidate subpopulation of neutrophils specifically responsive to dexamethasone. Conclusions Our analyses i) confirm the anti-inflammatory properties and indicate possible modes of action for dexamethasone, ii) validate anti-viral effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment, and iii) reveal synergistic effects of a combination therapy and can thus inform more effective COVID-19 therapies.","output":"Insights into standards of care C dexamethasone and antibodies against COVID-19 in hamster models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Web of Data, the Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0 are converging, and society is challenged to ensure that appropriate regulatory responses can uphold the rule of law fairly and effectively in this emerging context.

Diagnostic accuracy metrics were estimated in relation to RT-PCRs collected within one day before the first or after the last included rapid antigen tests in a series. Results: Of the 17,669 residents who contributed at least one RT-PCR or rapid antigen during the study period, 3,979 contributed []1 paired rapid antigen test series. In relation to RT-PCR, the three-rapid antigen test strategy had a sensitivity of 89.6% (95% confidence intervals: 86.1-92.6%) and specificity of 97.2% (CI: 95.1-98.3%). The sensitivities for two and one-rapid antigen test strategy were 75.2% and 52.8%, respectively, and the specificities were 98.5% and 99.4%, respectively. The sensitivity was higher among symptomatic residents and when the RT-PCR was collected before the rapid antigen tests. Conclusions: We found the serial collection of an antigen test resulted in high diagnostic accuracy.

I recall a few situations where statistics made a real difference and reinforced the impact of our discipline on society. Sometimes the difference lay in the insightful analysis and inference enabled by ground-breaking methods in our field like hypothesis testing, likelihood ratios, Bayesian models, jackknife, and bootstrap. But perhaps more often, the impacts came from thoughtful analyses before data were collected, and the questions that arose after the statistical analysis. The impact of understanding the problem, designing the experiment and data collections, conducting the pilot surveys, and raising important questions, is substantial. Through sensible explorations following formal statistical procedures, statisticians have made contributions in many domains. In this presentation, I recall some examples which made a long-lasting impact. Some of them, like randomization in clinical trials, known and familiar to all, are so ingrained in our practice that the role of statistics has been forgotten.

This called to mind previous evidence for an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental disorders. Pilot open trials suggested that BDV-1 infected depressed patients benefitted from antiviral therapy with a licensed drug (amantadine) which also tested sensitive in vitro. Here, we designed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) which cross-linked depression and BDV-1 infection, addressing both the antidepressant and antiviral efficacy of amantadine. METHODS: The interventional phase II RCT (two 7-weeks-treatment periods and a 12-months follow-up) at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Germany, assigned currently depressed BDV-1 infected patients with either major depression (MD; N = 23) or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 13) to amantadine sulphate (PK-Merz?; twice 100 mg orally daily) or placebo treatment, and contrariwise, respectively. Clinical changes were assessed every 2C3 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). RESULTS: Primary outcomes (25% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohens d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance.

Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4C10 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 g/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate profound antidepressant efficacy of safe oral amantadine treatment, paralleling antiviral effects at various infection levels. This not only supports the paradigm of a link of BDV-1 infection and depression.

Further, we derive the explicit expressions of time-varying parameters of the SIRD model unlike most works that consider static parameters without any closed form solution.

Even though respiratory failure is the cardinal form of severe COVID-19, concomitant cardiac involvement is common. Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis due to heterogeneity of clinical presentation, ranging from mild symptoms to fatal arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock (CS). The aetiology is often viral and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard for definite myocarditis. However, the diagnosis is often made on medical history, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood tests. Case summary We present a 43-year-old man with mixed connective tissue disease treated with hydroxychloroquine who rapidly developed CS 4 days from symptom onset with fever and cough, showing positive polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. While computed tomography of the thorax was normal, high-sensitivity troponin T was elevated and electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and low voltage as signs of myocardial oedema. Echocardiography showed severe depression of left ventricular function. The myocardium recovered completely after a week with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). EMB was performed but could neither identify the virus in the cardiomyocytes, nor signs of inflammation. Still the most probable aetiology of CS in this case is myocarditis as a sole symptom of COVID-19.

This is best achieved with integrated care, which is based on the chronic care model of disease management, proactively addressing the patients unique medical, social, psychological, and cognitive needs along the trajectory of the disease. While conceptually appealing, integrated care requires not only a different approach to disease management, but considerably more health care resources. One potential way to reduce this burden of care is telemedicine: technology that allows for the bidirectional transfer of important clinical information between the patient and health care providers across distances. This not only makes medical services more accessible; it may also enhance the efficiency of delivery and quality of care. Telemedicine includes distinct, often overlapping interventions, including telecommunication (enhancing lines of communication), telemonitoring (symptom reporting or the transfer of physiological data to health care providers), physical activity monitoring and feedback to the patient and provider, remote decision support systems (identifying red flags, such as the onset of an exacerbation), tele-consultation (directing assessment and care from a distance), tele-education (through web-based educational or self-management platforms), tele-coaching, and tele-rehabilitation (providing educational material, exercise training, or even total pulmonary rehabilitation at a distance when standard, center-based rehabilitation is not feasible). While the above components of telemedicine are conceptually appealing, many have had inconsistent results in scientific trials. Interventions with more consistently favorable results include those potentially modifying physical activity, non-invasive ventilator management, and tele-rehabilitation. More inconsistent results in other telemedicine interventions do not necessarily mean they are ineffective; rather, more data on refining the techniques may be necessary.

This study investigated whether using anastomotic sealants (TissuCol(?), Histoacryl(?) Flex, and Duraseal(?)) prevents leakage in a rat peritonitis model. STUDY DESIGN Sixty-seven Wistar rats were divided into control and experimental groups (TissuCol, Histoacryl, and Duraseal groups). Peritonitis was induced 1 day before surgery with the cecal ligation puncture model. On day 0, colonic anastomosis was constructed with sutures and then sealed with no adhesive (control group) or one select adhesive (experimental groups). Bursting pressure, abscess formation, and adhesion severity were evaluated on day 3 or day 14. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD8, CD206, and iNOS were performed. RESULTS On day 3, bursting pressures of the TissuCol group (120.1  25.3 mmHg), Histoacryl group (117.3  20.2 mmHg), and Duraseal group (123.6  35.4 mmHg) were significantly higher than the that of the control group (24.4  31.7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Abscesses around the anastomosis were found in the control group (6/7) and Duraseal group (2/9) but not in the TissuCol group or Histoacryl group. A higher number of CD206+ cells (M2 macrophages), a lower number of iNOS+ cells (M1 macrophages), a higher M2/M1 index, and a higher CD4+/CD8+ index were seen at the anastomotic site in all experimental groups compared with the control group on day 3. On day 14, abscesses were only found in the control group. Adhesion severity in the Duraseal group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.001).

Chaiqin chengqi decoction (CQCQD) has been proven clinically to be an effective treatment for AP for decades in West China Hospital. Quality control for CQCQD containing many hundreds of characteristic phytochemicals poses a challenge for developing robust quality assessment metrics. PURPOSE To evaluate quality consistency of CQCQD with a multi-strategy based analytical method, identify potential quality-markers (Q-markers) based on drug properties and effect characteristics, and endeavor to establish CQCQD as a globally-accepted medicine. METHODS A typical analysis of constitutive medicinal plant materials was performed following the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The extraction process was optimized through an orthogonal array (L9(34)) to evaluate three levels of liquid to solid ratio, soaking time, duration of extraction, and the number of extractions. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) fingerprinting combined with absolute quantitation of multi chemical marker compounds, coupled with similarity, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were performed to evaluate 10 batches of CQCQD. On the basis of systematic analysis of fundamental features of CQCQD in treating AP, the potential Q-marker screen was proposed through detection of quality transfer and efficacy for chemical markers. UHPLC coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry were used to determine compounds in medicinal materials, decoctions and plasma. Network pharmacology and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate induced pancreatic acinar cell death were used to evaluate the correlation between chemical markers and anti-pancreatitis activity. A cerulein induced AP murine model was used to validate quality assessed CQCQD batches at clinically-equivalent dose. The effective content of chemical markers was predicted using linear regression analysis on quantitative information between validated batches and the other batches. RESULTS The chemical markers and other physical and chemical indices in the original materials met Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. A total of 22 co-existing fingerprint peaks were selected and the similarity varied between 0.946 and 0.990. Batch D10 possessed the highest similarity index. HCA classified the 10 batches into 2 main groups: 7 batches represented by D10 and 3 batches represented by D1. During the initial Q-marker screen stage, 22 compounds were detected in both plant materials and decoctions, while 13 compounds were identified in plasma. Network pharmacology predicted the potential targets and pathway of AP related to the 22 compounds. All 10 batches showed reduced necrosis below 60% with the best effect achieved by D10 (~40%). The spectrum-efficacy relationship analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis indicated that emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, geniposide, hesperridin, chrysin, syringin, synephrine, geniposidic acid, magnolol, physcion, sinensetin, and baicalein showed positive correlation with pancreatic acinar cell death protection. Similar to the in vitro evaluation, batch D10 significantly reduced total histopathological scores and biochemical severity indices at a clinically-equivalent dose but batch D1 did not. The content of naringin, narirutin and baicalin in batches D1, D5 and D9 consistently exceeds the upper limit of the predicted value. Eight markers whose lower limit is predicted to be close to 0 contributed less to the material basis for AP protection. CONCLUSION Despite qualified materials used for CQCQD preparation, the clinical effect depends on appropriate content range of Q-markers. Emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, magnolol, hesperidin, synephrine, baicalein, and geniposide are considered as vital Q-markers in the primary screen.

After adjusting for baseline confounders, patients in the hypoalbuminemia group had a higher risk of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.18 in the ESPEN 2 group, p < 0.05), major complications (OR 1.98, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.20, p < 0.05), surgical complications (OR 1.77, 95% p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.1, p > 0.05), medical complications (OR 1.73, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.16, p > 0.05), surgical site infection (OR 1.32, p < 0.05 vs. OR 0.86, p > 0.05), and prolonged hospitalization (OR 1.79, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.22, p < 0.05). Patients who met both criteria were at highest risk. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative measurement of serum albumin appears to be essential to identify patients at risk for complications after colorectal cancer surgery.

Treatment options for coronaviruses are limited. Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited.

The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars-CoV-2. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and COVID-dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID-19 terminology and neurology terminology up to 10 May 2020. Social media channels were followed up between 15 March and 10 May 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified papers and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and autoimmune disorders such as the Guillain-Barr syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms.

Focus on ACE2's role in cardiometabolic health has largely centered on its apparent functions in the context of obesity. Interest in ACE2 has become even greater with the discovery that it serves as the cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), opening up numerous mechanisms for deleterious effects of infection. The proliferation of ACE2 within the literature coupled with its dual role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and obesity necessitates review of the current understanding of ACE2's physiological, pathophysiological, and potential therapeutic functions.

Responding to these diseases requires a workforce trained in multi-disciplinary approaches to zoonotic disease research and control. It is difficult to deliver multidisciplinary and one health training globally because of the limited number of higher education programs that support such training. In low and middle-income countries where the impacts of emerging zoonotic diseases are felt more directly there is enthusiasm for such training and the use of e-technology can foster international, long-term collaborations. OBJECTIVES: To provide health training for infectious diseases research and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration. METHODS: We designed and simultaneously held two training workshops, one focused on pediatric infectious diseases and another on emerging infectious diseases to meet the objective. Both workshops had pre- and post-workshop activities for multi-disciplinary methods with an emphasis on the use of mobile technologies to enhance emerging infectious diseases surveillance and research for public health professionals in Egypt. Faculty and scientists from all universities in Egypt and from the National Research Center were invited to participate. RESULTS: 85 participants attended, 31 abstracts were submitted, and over a 3 year period 3 international grant applications were submitted, and 4 abstracts were presented at international conferences. An online forum was developed to continue building collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Interactive on-site workshops are suitable for providing multi-disciplinary training for disease surveillance, research and disease control.

We discovered that SBAs ability to boost cross-presentation depends on the induction of lipid bodies (LBs). Moreover, the MHCII(lo)CD11b(hi) DC subset was identified to be most responsive to SBA-induced cross-presentation. The aim is to further unravel the mechanisms behind the induction of DC cross-presentation by SBAs. Here we show that SBAs specifically induce the PKR-like Endoplasmic Reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway and that SBA-induced DC cross-presentation is dependent on activation of the PERK pathway. PERK activation and LB formation are both crucial for SBA-induced cross-presentation and PERK inhibition has little or no effect on SBA-induced LB formation. SBAs responsiveness, LB formation and PERK activation are specific for the MHCII(lo)CD11b(hi) DCs. These findings contribute to understanding the pathways involved in SBA-induced cross-presentation and immune activation which will ultimately lead to the development of vaccines with improved efficiency and safety.

However, the absence of pulsatility brought about by continuous-flow devices may variably trigger RAAS activation depending on left ventricular (LV) intrinsic contractility, the design and speed of the pump device. Moreover, the concept of myocardial recovery is being tested in clinical trials and in this setting LVAD support combined with intense RAAS inhibition can promote recovery and ensure maintenance of LV function after explantation. Blood pressure control on LVAD recipients is key to avoiding complications as gastrointestinal bleeding, pump thrombosis and stroke.

As patients' own perspectives about their health increasingly are guiding treatment decisions, it seems important to study the simultaneous association of psychological distress and neuropathology with hand disability in patients who have CTS, as this may help prioritize and sequence management steps. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES What are the relationships among validated scores for (1) depression, (2) anxiety, (3) pain catastrophizing, and (4) nerve electrodiagnostic severity with measures of hand disability in patients with confirmed CTS? METHODS Between 2017 and 2019, we evaluated 116 patients for CTS in a referral urban hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Of those, we considered 85% (99) as potentially eligible by considering the following Electromyography-Nerve Conduction Study (EMG-NCS) diagnostic criteria: sensory latency  3.5 Ms, median-ulnar latency difference  0.5 Ms, motor latency  4.2 Ms, and abnormal EMG findings in the opponens pollicis muscle (neurogenic motor unit action potentials, positive sharp waves, or fibrillation). A further 13% (15 of 116) were excluded because of nonidiopathic CTS and prior surgery, and another 12% (14 of 116) were lost because of incomplete datasets, leaving 60% (70 of 116) for final inclusion in this cross-sectional study. In all, 89% of patients were women with total mean age of 47 years. We measured depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire (scored from 0 to 21, with a minimum clinically important difference [MCID] of 1.7 points), and we evaluated patients' state of mind regarding pain using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) (scored from 0 to 52). Higher scores on these questionnaires represent more distress and pain catastrophizing. Hand disability was assessed with Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire outcomes (scored from 0 [no disability] to 100 [most severe disability]; MCID of 15 points), Likert pain score (from 0 to 10), and grip/pinch dynamometry results. Correlational analyses were conducted once among HADS and PCS scores and again among EMG-NCS indices with pain and disability variables to answer our first, third, and fourth questions, respectively. Regression analysis was performed to assess the percentage of variance in QuickDASH and pain severity, which could be explained by psychological and electrodiagnostic factors. We did not include grip and pinch in our multivariable model (regression analysis) as dependent variables because they did not correlate with any of psychological or EMG-NCS variables (all p values > 0.1). Significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS Correlational analysis showed that the scores of all three psychological questionnaires correlated with the QuickDASH score (r = 0.50, 0.42, and 0.53 for HADS-A, HADS-D, and PCS, respectively; p < 0.001 for all three), while EMG-NCS parameters had no correlation with QuickDASH and pain scores. We also found that 37% of the variance in QuickDASH score can be explained by HADS and PCS scores (r2 = 0.37; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Evaluation and treatment of psychological distress before deciding on elective surgery for CTS is important because patient-reported disability-often used as a factor in surgical decision-making-is substantially correlated with emotional distress. Future prospective, controlled studies on this topic are recommended; ideally, these should evaluate psychological interventions specifically to ascertain whether they improve patients' ratings of hand disability.

However, most nondestructive techniques focused on an aspect of concrete configuration based on comparison to other samples. In this paper, an innovative inverse analysis technique was developed to inspect different attributes of concrete configuration simultaneously. The methodology was based on the scattering feature of the ultrasonic waves during propagation in heterogeneous media. The transition matrix method was employed to determine the scattered wavefield. This method considers the shape of objects, unlike most other numerical methods. Furthermore, a novel algorithm was presented to establish a realistic space in three-dimensional for concrete. The Voronoi diagram and shrinking process established the framework of the algorithm. The inverse model conducted observation data from media to concrete configuration through the direct model. The inverse procedure extracted vast information from the medium. Statistical theory provided statistical inference based on Bayesian statistics for this procedure. The introduced inverse analysis technique then scrutinized the concrete specimens. For this aim, geopolymer concrete with different configurations was nominated as a sample of concrete material. In the end, the precision, accuracy, and validity of the inverse model solution were assayed in the light of statistics.

This study explores how digital media has advanced safer behavior among ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults during the pandemic in authoritarian societies. We explored the level of adherence to government-issued health guidelines during the Covid-19 pandemic by conducting a public opinion survey among a representative sample of ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults (N = 500) during the second Covid-19 wave (Autumn 2020). The results show that digital media usage significantly contributes to higher levels of adherence to health guidelines. This offers new insight into the field of new media research, revealing the significant role of digital media in promoting safer behavior in times of emergency in authoritarian communities, possibly because it bypasses Internet censorship and disinformation. It also emphasizes the need for adapting risk communication to the media habits and cultural beliefs of different social groups, in turn contributing to well-being and life itself.

Proliferation of CAR T-cells after infusion and their persistence have been reported as important factors. Laboratory tools are needed for the monitoring of patients. We developed a vector-based, simple and accurate real-time qPCR to measure axi-cel vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood samples. Primers and probe targeting the 5'LTR region of the gammaretroviral vector (mouse stem cell virus or MSCV) were designed for amplification. To generate standard curves MSCV plasmid was subcultured and quantified using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The method was applied to quantify VCN in blood samples from patients treated with axi-cel. The limit of quantification of the qPCR assay was established at 2.2 copies/L in DNA eluate. The qPCR method was well correlated with flow cytometry (FC) findings; however, the assay appeared to be more sensitive than FC. The kinetics observed in blood samples from treated patients was in agreement with previously reported findings. In conclusion, we developed a sensitive and accurate qPCR assay for the quantification of transgenic CAR T-cells, which can be a useful additional tool for the monitoring of patients treated with of axi-cel.","output":"A real-time quantitative PCR targeting the viral vector for the monitoring of patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 infections in Hong Kong, the world model city of universal masking, has resulted in a major public health crisis.

With the promulgation of plastic bans in many countries, the global plastic waste trade will undergo tremendous change. In order to explore the future evolutionary trend of the global plastic waste trade network, this paper focuses on the analysis of the import and export of plastic waste from major trading countries around the world. Based on the bilateral trade volume of plastic waste from 1990 to 2019, a global plastic waste trade network is constructed, and the structure and characteristics of the network are studied. The results show that the global plastic waste trade network has shifted its center of gravity, and the import center has gradually shifted from China to Southeast Asia. The global plastic waste trade network presents a sparse state. Moreover, the dependence of related countries on plastic waste trade decreases, whilst the closeness of trade links also decreases.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social distance, can slow the transmission. However, both mask and social distance have not prevented the spread of respiratory viruses SARS-CoV2 within the US. There is an urgent need to develop an intervention that could reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. The key to preventing transmission is to eliminate the emission of SARS-CoV2 from an infected person and stop the virus from propagating in the human population. Rhamnolipids are environmentally friendly surfactants that are less toxic than the synthetic surfactants. In this study, rhamnolipid products, 222B, were investigated as disinfectants against enveloped viruses, such as bovine coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The 222B at 0.009% and 0.0045% completely inactivated 6 and 4 log PFU/mL of HSV-1 in 5-10 min, respectively. 222B at or below 0.005% is also biologically safe. Moreover, 50 L of 222B at 0.005% on ~1 cm2 mask fabrics or plastic surface can inactivate ~103 PFU HSV-1 in 3-5 min.

The currently practiced wastewater disinfection technologies are challenged by toxic by-products, chemicals and energy demand, a range of effectiveness limitations, among other concerns. An effective, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient alternative disinfection technique is desirable to modernize and enhance wastewater treatment operations. Copper and nickel micro-structured metal foams, and a conventional copper mesh, were evaluated as disinfecting surfaces for treating secondary-treated wastewater contaminated with coliform bacteria. The micro-structured copper foam was adopted for scale-up study, due to its stable and satisfactory bactericidal performance obtained over a wide range of bacterial concentrations and metal-to-liquid ratios. Three scales of experiments, using two types of reactor designs, were performed using municipal wastewater to determine the optimal scale-up factors: small lab-scale batch reactor, intermediate lab-scale batch reactor, and pilot-scale continuous tubular reactor experiments. The performance was evaluated with the aim of minimizing metal material requirement with respect to bactericidal efficiency and leaching risks at all scales. Copper foam, at or above optimal conditions, consistently inactivated over 95% of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and E.coli in wastewater at various scales, and leachate copper concentrations were determined to be below Canadian guideline values for outfall. This study successfully implemented the structure strategy of process intensification, and opens up the possibility to apply micro-structured copper foam in a range of other water disinfection systems, from pre-treatment to point-of-use, and should thus become a topic of further research.","output":"Micro-structured copper and nickel metal foams for wastewater disinfection: proof-of-concept and scale-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous viruses, mycoplasmas, bacteria and parasites have been associated with infectious diseases in laboratory animals. It is clear that pathogenic agents causing overt disease represent a serious hazard to research results in both short- as well as long-term studies. However, these organisms may contaminate colonies without causing any clinical or pathological symptom. This makes research less reliable because of the more subtle effects of the silent infections, especially in long-term studies as in aging research.

Data were collected retrospectively from academic records of Physiology and Anatomy courses of a private medical college, in which students had attempted sequential on-campus and online modular exams. We developed a statistical model to predict on-campus and online exam scores of undergraduate medical students, from their previous academic records. Hypothesizing that the predictor model contains comparable explanatory power for both exams, we utilized the explanatory power variation (R(2) statistics) of the improvised model to predict academic dishonesty behavior in traditional vs online exams. Reduced explanatory power (R(2 )statistics) of the model for any mode of the exam, in which students scored considerably different from their previous academic record, was interpreted as indirect evidence of academic dishonesty. Our model explained a large proportion of variation (R(2)) in overall scores of on-campus and online Physiology and Anatomy modules. Whereas, the model could explain only a small proportion of variation in scores of online theory exams, with a moderate effect size (adjusted R(2)). Reduced explanatory power for both Physiology and Anatomy online theory exams implies the chance of academic dishonesty in this particular component of the online exam.

As a targeted and highly active antitumor agent, VEN induces rapid and profound tumor reduction. Inpatient monitoring for initial doses of VEN is recommended by US Prescribing Information for pts with medium tumor burden and reduced renal function or high tumor burden. Administration of debulking agents, such as obinutuzumab (G), help reduce tumor burden and, consequently, facilitate subsequent administration of VEN in the outpatient setting. However, tumor reduction data are needed to definitively establish the utility of a debulking strategy. This study performed disease restaging after every 2 cycles of debulking to evaluate the safety and efficacy of G  bendamustine (B) as a debulking regimen before VEN treatment in the outpatient community setting. The safety and efficacy of subsequent VEN+G treatment after debulking was also evaluated. Methods: This open-label, Phase 3b study (NCT03406156) enrolled adult pts with previously untreated CLL/SLL (except those with 17p deletion) who had medium (any lymph node [LN] 5 to <10 cm or absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] 2510 9/L) or high (any LN 10 cm or any LN 5 cm and ALC 2510 9/L) tumor burden. A maximum of six 28-day cycles of GB were administered, and disease restaging was performed after every 2 cycles. Once low tumor burden was achieved (all LN <5 cm and ALC <25x10 9/L), VEN+G was administered for 5 cycles followed by VEN monotherapy for a total time on VEN of up to 1 year. Disease assessments were performed at the end of combination therapy (EoCT;5 mo after last dose of G) and at the end of therapy (EoT;3 mo after last dose of VEN), and peripheral blood was collected for assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) using the clonoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Undetectable MRD was defined as <1 CLL cell/10 4 leukocytes (<10 -4;uMRD4), <10 -5 (uMRD5), or <10 -6 (uMRD6). The primary endpoints were the percentage of pts achieving low tumor burden after 2, 4, and 6 cycles of GB debulking and complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) rates among pts receiving VEN. Results: Of 120 pts treated, 81 received G for debulking and 39 received G+B. As of 13 May 2021, 2 pts remained on study treatment, 108 were in posttreatment follow-up, and 10 had discontinued the study for reasons including death (n=7), withdrawn consent (n=2), and COVID-19 infection (n=1). At baseline, 82.5% of pts had ALC 25x10 9/L, 33.3% had LN 5 cm, and 24.2%/75.0%/0.8% had high/medium/low tumor burden, respectively. Low tumor burden was achieved in 91.6% (109/119) of evaluable pts receiving GB debulking. In the all-treated population (N=120), the objective response rate (ORR) was 90.0% and the CR/CRi rate was 35.8%. Among pts receiving VEN with disease assessment at EoT (N=76), the ORR was 98.7% and the CR/CRi rate was 44.7% (Table). The best uMRD4 rates in peripheral blood were 89.2% (107/120) for all-treated and 98.2% (107/109) for evaluable pts. Among evaluable pts, the uMRD4 rates were 100% (100/100) and 97.1% (68/70) at EoCT and EoT, respectively. Among pts with MRD assessments at both timepoints (N=67), 19.4% had a deepening of their MRD response from EoCT to EoT, and 67.2% maintained the same MRD level (Figure). At a median follow-up of 24.0 mo, 7 deaths (6 related to COVID-19 infection and 1 from cardiac complication after pancreatic mass resection) and no incidences of disease progression were reported;the estimated 18-mo PFS was 94.1%. In pts treated with G vs G+B debulking, respectively, the incidences of Grade 3 TEAEs were 71.6% vs 84.6% (most common was neutropenia at 28.4% vs 41.0%) and serious AEs were 23.5% vs 17.9% (most common were pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia, each at 3.7% vs 2.6%). Conclusion: In this study, most (91.6%) pts achieved low tumor burden after debulking. The uMRD4 rate was 98.2% among MRD-evaluable pts (89.2% among al pts), with 100% and 97.1% uMRD4 rates at EoCT and EoT, respectively. Overall, these results highlight the utility of GB as an effective debulking strategy that can facilitate VEN treatment initiation in the outpatient setting. The efficacy and safety results are consistent with other VEN+G trials. Preventive measures for COVID-19 should be continuously emphasized for pts with CLL.

Spike proteins consist of S1 and S2 domains, which recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and contain the viral fusion machinery, respectively. Ostensibly, the binding of spike trimers to ACE2 receptors promotes the preparation of the fusion machinery by dissociation of the S1 domains. We report the development and use of coarse-grained models and simulations to investigate the dynamical mechanisms involved in viral binding and exposure of the S2 trimeric core. We show that spike trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers. The multivalent interaction cyclically and processively induces S1 dissociation, thereby exposing the S2 core containing the fusion machinery. Our simulations thus reveal an important concerted interaction between spike trimers and ACE2 dimers that primes the virus for membrane fusion and entry. Significance Statement Viral particles of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are decorated by spike trimer proteins that mediate entry into cells. Spike trimers first bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and subsequently shed their receptor-binding components to expose and prepare the viral fusion machinery. Here, we present systematically developed coarse-grained models and molecular dynamics simulations of viral binding and shedding prior to membrane fusion. Our analysis shows that spike trimers are capable of binding to multiple ACE2 dimers and that this multivalent interaction facilitates exposure of the viral fusion core machinery. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of concerted, cooperative interactions between viral proteins and host cell receptors, and advance fundamental understanding and therapeutic efforts on coronaviruses, aspects of which are at present difficult if not impossible to obtain by experimental means alone.","output":"Cooperative multivalent receptor binding promotes exposure of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery core"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It was suggested that Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect more frequently and with more severe evolution cancer patients Our objectiv","output":"Clinical Characteristics, Care Trajectories and Mortality Rate of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cancer Patients Among 29307 Cancer Patients in AP-HHospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

While the disease course usually appears mild, severe and critical COVID-19 appears to lead to significant morbidity including ICU admission with prolonged hospital stay, intubation, mechanical ventilation and even death. Although there are recent reports regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, information regarding the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant versus non-pregnant women remains unknown. Objective We aim to describe the outcomes of severe and critical COVID-19 infection in pregnant versus non-pregnant reproductive aged women. Study Design This is a multi-center retrospective case-control study of women with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19 in four academic medical centers in NYC and one in Philadelphia between March 12 and May 5, 2020. The cases consist of pregnant women admitted specifically for severe or critical COVID-19 and not for obstetric indication. The controls consist of reproductive aged, non-pregnant women admitted for severe or critical COVID-19. The primary outcome is a composite morbidity including: death, need for intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or need for high flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. Secondary outcomes include ICU admission, length of stay, need for discharge to long term acute care facility and discharge with home oxygen requirement. Results Thirty-eight pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed infection were admitted to five institutions specifically for COVID-19, 29 (76.3%) meeting criteria for severe disease and 9 (23.7%) meeting criteria for critical disease. The mean age and BMI were significantly higher in the non-pregnant control group. The non-pregnant cohort was also noted to have increased frequency of pre-existing medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Pregnant women were more likely to experience the primary outcome when compared to the non-pregnant control group (34.2% vs. 14.9%, p=0.03, adjusted OR 4.6 [95% CI 1.2-18.2]). Pregnant patients experienced higher rates of ICU admission (39.5% vs. 17.0%, p<0.01, adjusted OR 5.2 [95% CI 1.5-17.5]). Among pregnant women that underwent delivery, 72.7% occurred via cesarean delivery and mean gestational age at delivery was 33.8 5.5 weeks in patients with severe disease and 35 3.5 weeks in patients with critical COVID-19. Conclusions Pregnant women with severe and/or critical COVID-19 are at increased risk for certain morbidities when compared to non-pregnant controls. Despite the higher comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension in the non-pregnant controls, the pregnant cases were at increased risk for composite morbidity, intubation, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be associated with a worse outcome in women with severe and critical COVID-19. Our study suggests that similar to other viral infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pregnant women may be at risk for greater morbidity and disease severity.","output":"Pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 have increased composite morbidity compared to non-pregnant matched controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research investigates the relationship between dietary habits and mortality patterns in the Roman Imperial and Medieval periods.

We analyzed the isotopic and mortality patterns of 616 individuals from 18 archeological sites (the Medieval Latium sites of Colonna, Santa Severa, Allumiere, Cencelle, and 14 Medieval and Imperial funerary contexts from Rome) to compile a survivorship analysis. A semi-parametric approach was applied, suggesting variations in mortality patterns between sexes in the Roman period. Nitrogen isotopic signatures influenced mortality in both periods, showing a quadratic and a linear effect for Roman Imperial and Medieval populations, respectively. No influence of carbon isotopic signatures has been detected for Roman Imperial populations.

Notably, this is becoming increasingly critical in preparing for public health emergencies. METHODS: To explore the coevolution dynamics between science and policy (SAP), this study explored the changes in, and development of, COVID-19 research in the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, from 30 December 2019 to 26 June 2020. In this study, VOSviewer was adopted to calculate the link strength of items extracted from scientific publications, and machine learning clustering analysis of scientific publications was carried out to explore dynamic trends in scientific research. Trends in relevant policies that corresponded to changing trends in scientific research were then traced. RESULTS: The study observes a salient change in research content as follows: an earlier focus on children and pregnant patients, common symptoms, nucleic acid test, and non-Chinese medicine was gradually replaced with a focus on aged patients, pregnant patients, severe symptoms and asymptomatic infection, antibody assay, and Chinese medicine. Mental health is persistent throughout Chinas COVID-19 research. Further, our research reveals a correlation between the evolution of COVID-19 policies and the dynamic development of COVID-19 research. The average issuance time of relevant COVID-19 policies in China is 8.36 days after the launching of related research. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of the outbreak in China, the formulation of research-driven-COVID-19 policies and related scientific research followed a similar dynamic trend, which is clearly a manifestation of a coevolution model (CEM). The results of this study apply more broadly to the formulation of policies during public health emergencies, and provide the foundation for future EBPM research.

METHODS: Surveillance physicians collected respiratory specimens from children aged <5 years hospitalized with respiratory illness and residing in the primary hospital catchment areas. We tested respiratory specimens for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus and rhinoviruses using rRT-PCR. During 2013, we conducted a health utilization survey in the primary catchment areas of the hospitals to determine the proportion of all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among children aged <5 years at the surveillance hospitals during the preceding 12 months. We estimated the respiratory virus-specific incidence of hospitalization by dividing the estimated number of hospitalized children with a laboratory confirmed infection with a respiratory virus by the population aged <5 years of the catchment areas and adjusted for the proportion of children who were hospitalized at the surveillance hospitals. RESULTS: We estimated that the annual incidence per 1000 children (95% CI) of all cause associated respiratory hospitalization was 11.5 (10C12). The incidences per 1000 children (95% CI) per year for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza infections were 3(2C3), 0.5(0.4C0.8), 0.4 (0.3C0.6), 0.4 (0.3C0.6), and 0.4 (0.3C0.6) respectively. The incidences per 1000 children (95%CI) of rhinovirus-associated infections among hospitalized children were 5 (3C7), 2 (1C3), 1 (0.6C2), and 3 (2C4) in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1432 patients (1857 lesions/ 2148 stents) with acute coronary syndromes, angioplasty was performed with Cordis 6F diagnostic catheters. Primary angioplasty was performed in 457 cases. In 76% of cases, iodixanol was used. All contrast injections were given by hand. A regular follow-up of the patients was performed 30 days after the procedure. All the procedures were performed through the femoral route. Tirofiban was used in 99% cases with adjusted dosages based on the creatinine values. The mean contrast volume used per patient was 28 ml (6 ml) including the angiogram prior to the angioplasty. Ninety one patients had creatinine more than 2mg/dl before the angioplasty procedures. Left main angioplasty was performed in 37 patients using single stents. 70 patients had cardiogenic shock at presentation. 76% of the cases had diabetes. IVUS was used in only two patients. A variety of coronary stents from various companies were used. Buddy wires were used in 36 cases. Ticagrelor was used in 92 cases, and in other cases clopidogrel was used. Mild reversible nephropathy (CIN) was observed in six patients. Four patients were already on dialysis, and dialysis was continued thereafter. Switch-over of angioplasty to the radial route was performed in five cases due to associated aortic/iliac obstructive lesions. 26 deaths in total were observed in this series; 16 of these patients had cardiogenic shock (7 late presenters), and three patients expired after discharge due to possible acute stent thrombosis. Groin haematoma was seen in five cases requiring one unit of blood transfusion. Proximal mild edge dissection in the deployed stent was seen in 3 cases which were treated with stents. Wire breakages were not seen. Acute in-hospital stent thrombosis was seen in 6 cases, which were managed with balloon dilatations and stents. Covid19 was positive in 16 cases by RT PCR.

The clinical manifestations of infected patients generally range from asymptomatic or mild to severe illness, or even death. The ability of the virus to evade the host immune response have been major reasons for high morbidity and mortality. One of the important clinical observations under conditions of critical illness show increased risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. Molecular mechanisms of how SARS CoV-2 induces such conditions still remain unclear. This report describes the presence of two unique motifs in the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-protein) that can potentially interact with fibrinogen and possibly prothrombin. This is based on an established function of secretory proteins in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- coagulase, Efb (Extracellular fibrinogen binding) and vWBP (von Willebrand factor Binding Protein), which are known to regulate the blood clotting cascade and the functions of host immune response. It is hypothesized that having protein interaction motifs that are homologous to these S. aureus proteins, the N-protein of this virus can mimic their functions, which may in turn play a crucial role in formation of blood clots in the host and help the virus evade host immune response. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in vitro. Considering the overwhelming increase in the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection globally, this information may be useful for further investigation and could help in deducing new therapeutic strategies to combat advanced stages of this disease.","output":"Unique Fibrinogen-binding motifs in the Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein of SARS CoV-2: Potential Implications in Host-Pathogen Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper employs a practice perspective to study and conceptualize supplier-switching processes in business relationships. It is based on case study research of a company in the international marine industry, which intended to switch one of its key suppliers for a new one as a result of cost-cutting strategies and dissatisfaction with the old supplier. The case study describes the process, which ended with the old supplier being only partially switched. The findings show how (partial) switching from one supplier to another happened via three key sub-processes and associated practices, which the involved actors in the case drew upon in the switching process: (1) initiation C a process enabled by legitimizing and search practices; (2) substitution C a process enabled by transfer, translation, and transformation practices; and (3a) stabilization C a process enabled by institutionalizing practices; and (3b) restoration C a process whereby the old supplier is retained as a result of new conditions, this retention being enabled by certain repair practices. By identifying the processes and practices that enable switching to happen, the findings offer an initial conceptualization of supplier-switching processes, which comprises an important and heretofore underexplored aspect of supplier switching.

A decrease in total emergency department (ED) volume followed, but the impact on injury is unknown. With lockdown and social distancing potentially increasing domicile discord, we hypothesized that intentional injury increased during COVID-19 primarily driven by an increase in penetrating trauma. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of acute adult patient care in an urban, level 1 trauma center assessed injury patterns. Presenting patient characteristics and diagnoses from 6 weeks pre- to 10 weeks post- a statewide stay-at-home order (SAHO, 3/16/2020) were compared; as well as to 2015- 2019. Subsets were defined by intentionality (intentional vs. non-intentional) and mechanism of injury (MOI, blunt vs. penetrating). Fisher exact and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare proportions and means. RESULTS: 357 and 480 trauma patients presented pre- and post-SAHO, respectively. Pre and post groups demonstrated differences in sex (35.6% vs. 27.9% female, p = 0.02), age (47.4  22.1 vs. 42  20.3, p = 0.009), and race (1.4% vs. 2.3% Asian; 63.3% vs. 68.3% Black; 30.5% vs. 22.3% White; 4.8% vs. 7.1% Other; p=0.03). Post-SAHO MOI revealed more intentional injury (p=0.0008). Decreases in non-intentional trauma after adoption of social isolation paralleled declines in daily ED visits. Compared to prior years, 2020 demonstrated a significantly greater proportion of intentional violent injury during the peri-pandemic months, especially from firearms. CONCLUSIONS: Unprecedented social isolation policies to address COVID-19 were associated with increased intentional injury, especially gun violence.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff &#8805;3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff &#8805;3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).

METHODS Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to March 2020, using terms related to patient-reported outcomes plus cirrhosis. Studies that analyzed an association between at least one factor and HRQoL in adult patients with cirrhosis were included. Abstract and full-text screening was performed by two reviewers. Data were collected on factors evaluated in each study and the significance of their association with HRQoL. RESULTS A total of 10,647 citations were reviewed, of which 109 met eligibility criteria. 76% of the studies used a generic instrument while only 45% used liver-specific instruments. Among identified factors, demographic factors and cirrhosis etiology were not generally associated with poor HRQoL except for poor social support. Depression, poor sleep and muscle cramps affected HRQoL in all the studies that evaluated them. Among comorbidities, frailty, falls, malnutrition and cognitive impairment were also associated with poor HRQoL in the majority of studies. Among cirrhosis-specific decompensating events, only hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was consistently associated with impairment in HRQoL (75% of studies).

We undertook a literature review to assess the usefulness of screening for peripheral venous thrombosis or pulmonary thrombosis in patients admitted with COVID-19. Outside of the ICU setting, D-dimer elevation on presentation or marked increase from baseline should alert the need for doppler ultrasound scan of the lower limbs. In the ICU setting, consideration should be given to routine screening with doppler ultrasound, given the high prevalence of thrombosis in this cohort despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. However, absence of lower limb thrombosis on ultrasound does not exclude pulmonary venous thrombosis. Screening with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not justified in patients on the general wards, unless there are clinical features and/or marked elevations in markers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the risk of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary thrombosis in ICU patients is very high, especially in patients on ECMO, where studies that employed routine screening for thrombosis with CT scanning have uncovered up to 100% incidence of pulmonary thrombosis despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, in patients at low bleeding risk and high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism, therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered even before screening, Our review highlights the need for increased vigilance for VTE, with a low threshold for doppler ultrasound and CTPA in high risk in-patient cohorts, where clinical features and D-dimer levels may not accurately reflect the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism.","output":"Screening for venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Whether long coronavirus disease pertains to children as well is not yet clear.

To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing, contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19. Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases. Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in India. Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for the next stages of the outbreak evolution.","output":"Modeling and forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are insufficient data about clinical outcomes in critically ill neurological patients with concomitant coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study describes the clinical characteristics, predictors of mortality, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19-positive neurological patients managed in a dedicated COVID-19 neurointensive care unit (CNICU). METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in critically ill neurological and neurosurgical patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection admitted to the CNICU at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, from July to November 2020. Patients demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and outcome data were retrieved from the manual and electronic medical records. Predictors of mortality and neurological outcome were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: During the study period, 50 COVID-19-positive neurological patients were admitted to the CNICU. Six patients were excluded from the analysis as they were managed in the CNICU for <24 hours. A poor outcome, defined as death or motor Glasgow Coma Scale <5 at hospital discharge, was observed in 34 of 44 patients (77.27%) with inhospital mortality in 26 of 44 patients (59%). Worst modified sequential organ failure assessment (MSOFA) score, lactate dehydrogenase maximum levels (LDH(max)), and lymphocyte count were predictors of inhospital mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.88, 1.01, and 0.87, respectively, whereas worst MSOFA and LDH(max) levels were predictors for poor neurological outcome with OR of 1.99 and 1.01, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in neurological patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection. Elevated inflammatory markers of COVID-19 suggest the role of systemic inflammation on clinical outcomes. Predictors of mortality and poor outcome were higher MSOFA score and elevated LDH levels. Additionally, lymphopenia was associated with mortality.

We aimed to determine the relative frequency and predictive value of single symptoms for paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections from an Ottawa COVID-19 assessment centre from October 2020 through April 2021. Overall, 46.3% (n=10,688) of pediatric encounters were for single symptoms, and 2.7% of these tested positive. The most common presenting single symptoms were rhinorrhea (31.8%), cough (17.4%) and fever (14.0%). Among children with high-risk exposures children in each age group, the following single symptoms had a higher proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases compared to no symptoms; fever and fatigue (0-4 years); fever, cough, headache, and rhinorrhea (5-12 years); fever, loss of taste or smell, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough (13-17 years). There was no evidence that the single symptom of either rhinorrhea or cough predicted SARS-CoV-2 infections among 0-4 year olds, despite accounting for a large volume (61.1%) of single symptom presentations in the absence of high-risk exposures.

Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout.

Historical mortality data for the 1630 Italian plague in northern Italy are first analysed. In contrast to the high rates recorded throughout the area from Milan to Florence, the mortality rate in Ferrara remained normal over the period. From the city's documents it emerged that the authorities, from the 16th century onwards, had already understood that the spread of the contagion could also occur through domestic animals, although rats are never mentioned. The strength of Ferrara's response to the \\"plague emergency\\" stems from an efficient and emergency-ready health control system, financed and supported by the \\"permanent surveillance team of the city and the Pontifical Legation of Ferrara - Azienda Sanitaria Pubblica\\" even in times of great economic difficulty for the State. Among the various measures that the city of Ferrara adopted to deal with the plague the following should be mentioned: guards at the city gates, lazarettos, safety of doctors, self-isolation and treatment of every suspicious case as if it were a real case of plague, measures to support the poorer classes of the population, veterinary and hygiene standards for the city and for housing, management of Catholic religious functions and the precepts of the Legation of Ferrara, which was under papal control, closure of churches to avoid mass gatherings, and limitations of all kinds of social and economic relations within and outside the population.

Therefore, we treated seven patients with malignant anaplastic brain tumors using the DBM protocol. DBM therapy consists of somatostatin and analogous (octreotide) all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), -Carotene, axerophthol dissolved in vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin C, melatonin (MLT), proteoglycans-glycosaminoglycans, valproic acid, acetazolamide, diethyldithiocarbamate, hydroxyurea, and temozolomide. These molecules have either antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, cytostatic, antioxidant, antimetastatic (differentiative), and immunomodulating features. Moreover, the inclusion of ATRA, MLT, and glucosamine with sodium valproate, diethyldithiocarbamate and acetazolamide has reinforced antitumor properties of the therapy by extending them to cancer stem cells. Furthermore, the non-cytolytic and non-cytotoxic metronomic dosage of hydroxyurea and temozolomide had increased the DBM therapy outcome by strengthening anti-tumor capability. The results of such treatment revealed that all seven patients were still alive after 5 to 8 years of starting DBM. In conclusion, the multi-strategic objectives of DBM are inhibiting the proliferative-invasiveness and neoplastic angiogenesis, silencing the survival system of cancer stem cells, enhancing the immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities, improving vitality and efficiency of normal cells, and depressing the efficiency and vitality of neoplastic ones.","output":"A retrospective observational study on cases of anaplastic brain tumors treated with the Di Bella Method: A rationale and effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work is concerned with the distinction between low-cost and network carriers within the airline industry.

Apparently, COVID-19 did not cause a demand shift within business models, and no differences in passengers perceptions regarding CSR were detected among models.

The timely quarantine, diagnosis, and treatment of infected people are the most necessary and important work. The most widely used method of detecting COVID-19 is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Along with RT-PCR, computed tomography (CT) has become a vital technique in diagnosing and managing COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 reveals a number of radiological signatures that can be easily recognized through chest CT. These signatures must be analyzed by radiologists. It is, however, an error-prone and time-consuming process. Deep Learning-based methods can be used to perform automatic chest CT analysis, which may shorten the analysis time. The aim of this study is to design a robust and rapid medical recognition system to identify positive cases in chest CT images using three Ensemble Learning-based models. There are several techniques in Deep Learning for developing a detection system. In this paper, we employed Transfer Learning. With this technique, we can apply the knowledge obtained from a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to a different but related task. In order to ensure the robustness of the proposed system for identifying positive cases in chest CT images, we used two Ensemble Learning methods namely Stacking and Weighted Average Ensemble (WAE) to combine the performances of three fine-tuned Base-Learners (VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet201). For Stacking, we explored 2-Levels and 3-Levels Stacking. The three generated Ensemble Learning-based models were trained on two chest CT datasets. A variety of common evaluation measures (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score) are used to perform a comparative analysis of each method. The experimental results show that the WAE method provides the most reliable performance, achieving a high recall value which is a desirable outcome in medical applications as it poses a greater risk if a true infected patient is not identified.","output":"Deep Ensemble Learning-Based Models for Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could alter mortality of COVID-19, but existing meta-analyses which combined crude and adjusted results may be confounded by comorbidities being more common in ARBs/ACE inhibitors users. METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase for cohort studies and meta-analysis reporting mortality by pre-existing ARB/ACE inhibitor treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease between users and non-users of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study-level during data synthesis. RESULTS: In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (OR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.96)). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no confounder adjustment performed (0.87 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.08)). CONCLUSIONS: ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

INTERVENTIONS Zero-heat-flux thermometry on the forehead and standard core temperature measurements. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Body temperature was measured using a new thermometry system (SpotOn; 3M, St. Paul, MN) on the forehead and with conventional methods in the esophagus during vascular surgery (n = 15), and in the nasopharynx and pulmonary artery during cardiac surgery (n = 15). The agreement between SpotOn and the conventional methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman random-effects approach for repeated measures. The mean difference between SpotOn and the esophageal temperature during vascular surgery was+0.08C (95% limit of agreement -0.25 to+0.40C). During cardiac surgery, during off CPB, the mean difference between SpotOn and the pulmonary arterial temperature was -0.05C (95% limits of agreement -0.56 to+0.47C). Throughout cardiac surgery (on and off CPB), the mean difference between SpotOn and the nasopharyngeal temperature was -0.12C (95% limits of agreement -0.94 to+0.71C). Poor agreement between the SpotOn and nasopharyngeal temperatures was detected in hypothermia below approximately 32C.

This study was performed to evaluate the blood lipid profile in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and exploring the underlying factors in its development and their predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. Methods: In a case-control study, the lipid profile of patients with COVID-19 at the first admitted to two clinical centers in the west of Iran (July 2020 to Dec. 2020) and age- and gender-matched healthy people were explored. Three groups of controls, patients with the severe form of Covid-19 (admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)), patients with Covid-19 with less intensity (outpatient admission), were defined for the subjects included in the study. The predictive values of different variables obtained from medical records for COVID-19 severity were analyzed. Results: Generally, 48 outpatients and 49 ICU patients, including 70 men and 23 women with a mean age of 62.413.5 years, were included in the study. The control group consisted of 32 people, match sex and age with the patient groups . The mean triglyceride (TG) in the Covid-19 groups was higher than the control group, but there was no significant difference between them. The mean cholesterol in the patient groups was lower than the control group (p=0.001). The mean of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly different in the patient groups;HDL-C in the ICU group was more than outpatient, and LDL-C in the outpatient group was more than ICU (P<0.05). LDL-C and HDL-C in the ICU group were less than the control group, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two mentioned groups. The frequency of diabetes and hypertension was higher in the ICU group than in the outpatient group (P<0.001). Furthermore, LDL-C level was associated with disease severity (odds ratio (OR): 0.966, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.944-0.989, P= 0.004). Conclusion: Lipid profiles in Covid-19 patients have different faces from healthy individuals.

A common pitfall is to rush to make a diagnosis when encountering a patient with COVID-19-like symptoms. The present study describes a series of COVID-19 mimics using an outpatient database collected from a designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: We established an emergency room (ER) tailored specifically for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 called the COVID-ER. In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we enrolled patients who visited the COVID-ER from February 1 to September 5, 2020. The outcomes included the prevalence of COVID-19, admission, potentially fatal diseases and final diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 2,555 eligible patients. The median age was 38 (interquartile range, 26-57) years old. During the study period, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 17.9% (457/2,555). Non-COVID-19 diagnoses accounted for 82.1% of all cases. The common cold had the highest prevalence and accounted for 33.0% of all final diagnoses, followed by gastroenteritis (9.4%), urinary tract infections (3.8%), tonsillitis (2.9%), heat stroke (2.6%) and bacterial pneumonia (2.1%).

METHODS: A retrospective cohort was conducted in French general hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were included if receiving HFNC for hypoxemia (saturation pulse oxygen (SpO2) <92% under oxygen a6 L/min) associated with ARDS and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Main clinical characteristics and outcomes are described in patients: (a) with do not intubate order (HFNC-DNIO); (b) who did not need intubation (HFNC-only); and (c) eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation). Medians are presented with (1st-3rd) interquartile range. RESULTS: From 26 February to 30 June 2020, 46 patients of median age 75 (70-79) years were included. In the HFNC-DNIO group (n = 11), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ratio median worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 109 (102-172) and hospital mortality was 54.5%. Except the HFNC-DNIO patients (n = 35), 20 patients (57%) were eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation group) and 15 were only treated by HFNC (HFNC-only). HFNC-intubation patients presented higher worst respiratory rates per minute in ICU [37 (34-41) versus 33 (24-34) min, p < 0.05] and worsened ICU admission PaO2/FiO2 ratios [121 (103-169) versus 191 (162-219), p < 0.001] compared with HFNC-only patients.

The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and potentiality of fluorescence cholecysto-cholangiography performed with a direct injection of indocyanine green (ICG) in the gallbladder and to compare it to systemic injection in such situations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven pigs were included in this non-survival study. In two pigs, the gallbladder was punctured by a percutaneous needle, and 1 mL of ICG in different concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/mL) was sequentially injected. Visibility and pattern of the fluorescent signal around Calot's triangle were examined and compared with those of two control pigs receiving 2.5 mg of intravenous ICG, 30 min prior to the operation. Different scenarios of cholecystitis were modeled using an injection of a mixture of blood and agarose gel around Calot's triangle area in the remaining three pigs, and the applicability of direct intragallbladder injection methods was evaluated. RESULTS The fluorescent signal was identified immediately after intragallbladder injection, and the cystic duct became visible by 0.1 and 1 mg/mL of ICG. The whole cystic duct and the infundibulum of the gallbladder were clearly enhanced by intragallbladder ICG injection, but not by systemic injection. In the cholecystitis models, the cystic duct could be identified only after partial dissection, and fluorescence visualization of the gallbladder infundibulum provided crucial information to find the correct starting point of dissection.

Using flow cytometry analysis, we measured the immune cell profiles and expression of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) in milk leukocytes before and during infection. Results: There was an eightfold increase in IFN&#945;+ milk leukocytes, from 1% before SARS-CoV-2 infection to 8% when actively infected. The milk macrophages showed the highest increase in IFN&#945; expression. Both T and B lymphocytes showed mild increase. Innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells showed no increase in IFN&#945; expression and the dendritic cells actually showed a reduction. Conclusion: We document the presence and high expression of IFN&#945; in the breast milk macrophages of a lactating mother with confirmed COVID-19, compared with her milk before the infection.","output":"High Levels of Interferon-Alpha Expressing Macrophages in Human Breast Milk During SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce the maximum $n$-times coverage problem that selects $k$ overlays to maximize the summed coverage of weighted elements, where each element must be covered at least $n$ times.

Additionally, in severely ill or immunocompromised adults, where respiratory infections are mostly attributed to bacteria and fungi; respiratory viruses can lead to severe complications. Objectives To evaluate the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) specimens from patients with lower respiratory tract disease. The study population consisted of different groups including immunocompetent patients (control patients), solid organ transplant recipients, patients with haematological malignancies and other immunocompromised adults. Study design A total of 134 BAL fluid specimens collected during 2009C2011 were retrospectively assessed with the new commercial multiplex real-time PCR FTD Respiratory 21 Plus?, targeting 18 different viruses and 2 atypical bacterial pathogens. Results Viral or atypical bacterial pathogens were detected in 29.1% of BAL fluid specimens. Coronaviruses were most prevalent (13.4%), followed by rhinoviruses (5.2%), RSV (4.5%) and bocaviruses (3.7%). Comparing the total number of viruses detected, a statistically significant difference was observed between the control group and patients with haematological malignancies (27.5% vs. 57.1%, p <0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the high prevalence of respiratory viruses in BAL fluid specimens from adult patients with lower respiratory tract disease. The methods to be used should be sensitive and cover a wide range of potential pathogens. The specific patient population can also influence the detection rates of respiratory viruses.","output":"Epidemiology of respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage samples in a tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout is reported to be epidemic among physicians and medical trainees, and wellness has been the predominant target for intervention in academic medicine over the past several years. However, both burnout and wellness suffer from a lack of standardized definition, often making interventions difficult to generalize and extrapolate to different sites. Although well-meaning, current frameworks surrounding wellness and burnout have limitations in fully addressing the challenges of improving physician mental health. Wellness as a framework does not inherently acknowledge the adversity inevitably experienced in the practice of medicine and in the lives of medical trainees. During a crisis such as the current pandemic, wellness curricula often do not offer adequate frameworks to address the personal, organizational, or societal crises that may ensue. This leaves academic institutions and their leadership ill-equipped to appropriately address the factors that contribute to burnout. More recently, resilience has been explored as another framework to positively influence physician wellness and burnout. Resilience acknowledges the inevitable adversity individuals encounter in their life and work, allowing for a more open discussion on the tensions and flexibility between facets of life. However, emphasizing personal resiliency without addressing organizational resiliency may leave physicians feeling alienated or marginalized from critical support and resources that organizations can and should provide. Despite intense focus on wellness and burnout, there have not been significant positive changes in physicians' mental health. Many interventions have aimed at the individual level with mindfulness or other reflective exercises; unfortunately these have demonstrated only marginal benefit. Systems level approaches have demonstrated more benefit but the ability of organizations to carry out any specific intervention is likely to be limited by their own unique constraints and may limit the spread of innovation. We believe the current use of these conceptual lenses (wellness and burnout) has been clouded by lack of uniformity of definitions, an array of measurement tools with no agreed-upon standard, a lack of understanding of the complex interaction between the constructs involved, and an over-emphasis on personal rather than organizational interventions and solutions. If the frameworks of burnout and wellness are limited, and personal resilience by itself is inadequate, what framework would be helpful? We believe that focusing on organizational resilience and the connecting dimensions between organizations and their physicians could be an additional framework helpful in addressing physician mental health. An organization connects with its members along multiple dimensions, including communication, recognition of gifts, shared vision, and sense of belonging. By finding ways to positively affect these dimensions, organizations can create change in the culture and mental health of physicians and trainees. Educational institutions specifically would be well-served to consider organizational resilience and its relationship to individuals.","output":"Shifting Focus from Burnout and Wellness toward Individual and Organizational Resilience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on our research and intervention in health promotion with patients and communities affected by various infectious diseases, in the project Knowledge-Sharing Platform.

Admission to a ward bed, which is subsequently upgraded within hours to an intensive care unit (ICU) bed, represents an inability to appropriately predict the patient's course of illness. Predicting which patients will require ICU care within 24 hours would allow admissions to be managed more appropriately. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adults admitted to a large health care system, including 14 hospitals across the state of Indiana. Included patients were aged &#8805; 18 years, were admitted to the hospital from the ED, and had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. Patients directly admitted to the ICU or in whom the PCR test was obtained > 3 days after hospital admission were excluded. Extracted data points included demographics, comorbidities, ED vital signs, laboratory values, chest imaging results, and level of care on admission. The primary outcome was a combination of either death or transfer to ICU within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Data analysis was performed by logistic regression modeling to determine a multivariable model of variables that could predict the primary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 542 included patients, 46 (10%) required transfer to ICU within 24 hours of admission. The final composite model, adjusted for age and admission location, included history of heart failure and initial oxygen saturation of <93% plus either white blood cell count > 6.4 or glomerular filtration rate < 46. The odds ratio (OR) for decompensation within 24 hours was 5.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.17 to 12.31) when all criteria were present. For patients without the above criteria, the OR for ICU transfer was 0.20 (95% CI = 0.09 to 0.45).

Subsequently, a virus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of the disease. Currently, the epidemic has spread all over the world. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. At the moment, the nuclide acid test is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of this infection. Methods: In the present paper, we report our experience with all patients who came to the Emergency Department from March 1 to April 1, 2020, with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patients: they all underwent a first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency department and, if negative, a second one after at least 24 hours. Results: Our study shows how the results obtained at time zero are usually identical to the ones obtained after 24 hours. We thus suggest, in patients with high suspicion of COVID19 and a negative result at the first swab, to repeat the test after at least 48 hours, during which patients with symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia disease should be kept in isolation to avoid the risk of contagion.

OBJECTIVE: In this scoping review, we seek to assess formal and informal definitions of digital public health in the literature and to understand how these definitions have been conceptualized in relation to digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. METHODS: We conducted a scoping literature search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and 14 government and intergovernmental agency websites encompassing 6 geographic regions. Among a total of 409 full articles identified, we reviewed 11 publications that either formally defined digital public health or informally described the integration of digital technologies into public health in relation to digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation, and we conducted a thematic analysis of the identified definitions. RESULTS: Two explicit definitions of digital public health were identified, each with divergent meanings. The first definition suggested digital public health was a reimagination of public health using new ways of working, blending established public health wisdom with new digital concepts and tools. The second definition highlighted digital public health as an asset to achieve existing public health goals. In relation to public health, digitization was used to refer to the technical process of converting analog records to digital data, digitalization referred to the integration of digital technologies into public health operations, and digital transformation was used to describe a cultural shift that pervasively integrates digital technologies and reorganizes services on the basis of the health needs of the public.

METHODS: The study has been conducted using the TCGA and the Regina Elena Institute databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC cells. We also included data from one COVID19 patient who went under surgery for HNSCC. RESULTS: TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues. It was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors, in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we modeled the multivariate effect of TP53, HPV, and other inherent variables on TMPRSS2. All variables had a statistically significant independent effect on TMPRSS2. In particular, in tumor tissues, HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes were associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. The further analysis of both TCGA and our institutional HNSCC datasets identified a signature anti-correlated to TMPRSS2. As proof-of-principle we also validated the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient tissues Finally, we did not find TMPRSS2 promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2.

We aimed to examine changes in service provision and utilization during the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, India and identify positive adaptations to service delivery. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys with frontline workers (FLW, n = 313) and mothers of children < 2 years (n = 659) in December 2019 (in-person) and July 2020 (by phone). We also interviewed block-level managers and obtained administrative data. We examined changes in service provision and utilization using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic, service provision reduced substantially during lockdown (83C98 percentage points, pp), except for home visits and take-home-rations (30%). Most FLWs (68C90%) resumed service provision in July 2020, except for immunization and hot-cooked meals (< 10%). Administrative data showed similar patterns of disruption and resumption. FLW fears, increased workload, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and manpower shortages challenged service delivery. Key adaptations made to provide services included: delivering services to beneficiary homes (40C90%), social distancing (80%), using PPE (40C50%), and telephones for communication (20%). On the demand side, service utilization also reduced substantially (40C80pp) during the lockdown, but about half of mothers received home visits and food supplementation.

Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization.","output":"Effects of Spike Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern on Human or Animal ACE2-Mediated Virus Entry and Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the French President called to war against the COVID\\\\19 which was followed by the launch of a military operation called Operation Resilience.

Two key areas of the company's personnel readiness for digital transformation have been identified: personnel restructuring area and personnel development area. It was revealed that most of the personnel of the oilfield service company under study is in the area of personnel restructuring, whose jobs will be subject to the greatest automation and will be eliminated. At the same time, some categories of women employees can be completely reduced (for example Accounting group, Bookkeeping and Payroll Clerks). In addition, in the personnel development zone, which will be less affected by automation, the wages of women are 3.4 times less than the wages of men. It is concluded that it is necessary to develop special corporate programs for professional training and retraining of women and special programs for personnel development, taking into account gender issues. ? 2021, Institute of Economic Sciences.

Methods: : This cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in Sweden. ECG, clinical data and laboratory findings during ICU stay were extracted from medical records and ECGs obtained near ICU admission were reviewed by two independent physicians. Results: : Eighty patients had an acceptable ECG near ICU-admission. In the entire cohort 30-day mortality was 28%. Compared to patients with normal ECG, among whom 30-day mortality was 16%, patients with ECG fulfilling criteria for prior myocardial infarction had higher mortality, 63%, odds ratio (OR) 9.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02-55.6) adjusted for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and patients with ST-T abnormalities had 50% mortality and OR 6.05 (95% CI 1.82-21.3) in univariate analysis.

MATERIAL AND METHOD In this retrospective study, we included 113 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted due to Covid-19 infection. In all patients, Covid-19 infection was confirmed with using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients were on ACE inh/ARBs or other antihypertensive therapy unless no contraindication was present. The primary outcome of the study was the in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using ACE inh/ARBs. During in-hospital follow up, 30.9% [n = 35 patients] of patients died. The frequency of admission to the ICU and endotracheal intubation were significantly higher in patients using ACE inh/ARBs. In a multivariable analysis, the use of ACE inh/ARBs was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.11-18.18; p= .032). Kaplan-Meir curve analysis displayed that patients on ACE inh/ARBs therapy had higher incidence of in-hospital death than those who were not. CONCLUSION The present study has found that the use of ACE inh/ARBs therapy might be associated with an increased in-hospital mortality in patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. It is likely that ACE inh/ARBs therapy might not be beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the results of the study.","output":"Is the use of ACE inb/ARBs associated with higher in-hospital mortality in Covid-19 pneumonia patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that physicians' recommendations are one of the top predictors for individuals to receive vaccines.

After the April 7, the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries.

METHODS: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study enrolling patients with laboratory\\\\confirmed COVID\\\\19 who were hospitalized in 32 Spanish hospitals. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values above the sex\\\\specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, as recommended by international guidelines. Thirty\\\\day mortality was defined as endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 1280 COVID\\\\19 patients were included in this study, of whom 187 (14.6%) died during the hospitalization. Using a nonspecific sex cut\\\\off, elevated troponin levels were found in 344 patients (26.9%), increasing to 384 (30.0%) when a sex\\\\specific cut\\\\off was used. This prevalence was significantly higher (42.9% vs 21.9%; P < .001) in patients in whom troponin T was measured in comparison with troponin I.

A. fumigatus possesses and expresses a range of genetic determinants of virulence, which facilitate colonisation and disease progression, including the secretion of mycotoxins. Gliotoxin (GT) is the best studied A. fumigatus mycotoxin with a wide range of known toxic effects that impair human immune cell function. GT is also highly toxic to A. fumigatus and this fungus has evolved self-protection mechanisms that include (i) the GT efflux pump GliA, (ii) the GT neutralising enzyme GliT, and (iii) the negative regulation of GT biosynthesis by the bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA. The transcription factor (TF) RglT is the main regulator of GliT and this GT protection mechanism also occurs in the non-GT producing fungus A. nidulans. However, A. nidulans does not encode GtmA and GliA. This work aimed at analysing the transcriptional response to exogenous GT in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans, two distantly related Aspergillus species, and to identify additional components required for GT protection in Aspergillus species. RNA-sequencing shows a highly different transcriptional response to exogenous GT with the RglT-dependent regulon also significantly differing between A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. However, we were able to observe homologues whose expression pattern was similar in both species (43 RglT-independent and 12 RglT-dependent). Screening of an A. fumigatus deletion library of 484 transcription factors (TFs) for sensitivity to GT identified 15 TFs important for GT self-protection. Of these, the TF KojR, which is essential for kojic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus oryzae, was also essential for GT biosynthesis in A. fumigatus and for GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and A. oryzae. KojR regulates rglT and gliT expression in Aspergillus spp. Together, this study identified conserved components required for GT protection in Aspergillus species. Author Summary A. fumigatus secretes mycotoxins that are essential for its virulence and pathogenicity. Gliotoxin (GT) is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin, which is known to impair several aspects of the human immune response. GT is also toxic to different fungal species, which have evolved several GT protection strategies. To further decipher these responses, we used transcriptional profiling aiming to compare the response to GT in the GT producer A. fumigatus and the GT non- producer A. nidulans. This analysis allowed us to identify additional genes with a potential role in GT protection. We also identified A. fumigatus 15 transcription factors (TFs) that are important for conferring resistance to exogenous gliotoxin. One of these TFs, KojR, which is essential for A. oryzae kojic acid production, is also important for GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and A. oryzae. KojR regulates the expression of another TF and an oxidoreductase, previously shown to be essential for GT protection.

However, culturally tailored interventions for this population have been slow to emerge. OBJECTIVE: This type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial examines the feasibility and efficacy of a gamified, culturally tailored, personalized normative feedback (PNF) alcohol intervention for sexual minority women who psychologically identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ). METHODS: The core components of a PNF intervention were delivered within LezParlay, a fun, social mediaCinspired, digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about LBQ women and increase visibility. The competition was advertised on the web through social media platforms and collaboration with LBQ community organizations. After 2 rounds of play by a large cohort of LBQ women, a subsample of 500 drinkers already taking part in the competition were invited to participate in the evaluation study. Study participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 unique sequences of PNF (ie, alcohol and stigma coping, alcohol and control, or control topics only) over 2 intervention rounds. Randomization was fully automated by the web app, and both researchers and participants were blinded. RESULTS: Analyses will evaluate whether PNF on alcohol use reduces participants drinking and negative consequences at 2 and 4 months postintervention; examine whether providing PNF on stigma-coping behaviors, in addition to alcohol use, further reduces alcohol use and consequences beyond PNF on alcohol alone; identify mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy; and examine broader LezParlay app engagement, acceptability, and perceived benefits. CONCLUSIONS: This incognito intervention approach is uniquely oriented toward engaging and preventing alcohol-related risks among community populations of LBQ women who may view their heavy drinking as normative and not in need of change because of the visibility of alcohol use in sexual minority community spaces. Thus, this intervention strategy diverges from, and is intended to complement, more intensive programs being developed to meet the needs of LBQ women already motivated to reduce their consumption.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databanks were searched using the following MESH terms: zebrafish, cisplatin, ototoxicity. The identified publications were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 26 qualifying manuscripts were included in the full-text analysis. The experimental protocols, including cisplatin concentrations, the exposure duration and the outcome measurements used in zebrafish larvae studies, were evaluated and the reported knowledge was summarized. RESULTS: Twenty-six substances protecting from cisplatin-induced toxicity were identified with the use of zebrafish larvae. These substances include quinine, salvianolic acid B, berbamine 6, benzamil, quercetin, dexmedetomidine, dexamethsanone, quinoxaline, edaravone, apocynin, dimethyl sulfoxide, KR-22335, SRT1720, ORC-13661, 3-MA, D-methionine, mdivi-1, FUT-175, rapamycin, Z-LLF-CHO, ATX, NAC, CYM-5478, CHCP1, CHCP2 and leupeptin. The otoprotective effects of compounds were attributed to their anti-ROS, anti-apoptotic and cisplatin uptake-blocking properties. The broadest range of protection was achieved when the experimental flow used preconditioning with an otoprotective compound and later a co-incubation with cisplatin. Protection against a high concentration of cisplatin was observed only in protocols using short exposure times (4 and 6 h). CONCLUSIONS: The data extracted from the selected papers confirm that despite the differences between the human and the zebra fish hearing thresholds (as affected by cisplatin), the sensory cells of zebrafish and larval zebrafish are a valuable tool which could be used: (i) for the discovery of novel otoprotective substances and compounds; (ii) to screen their side effects and (iii) to extend the knowledge on the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced inner ear damage.

All were ultimately classified as having probable SARS, suspect SARS, or another cause on the basis of their epidemiologic exposure, clinical and radiologic features, and results of microbiologic investigations. RESULTS Twenty-five children were included; 10 were classified as probable SARS and 5 were classified as suspect SARS, and in 10 another cause was identified. The exposure consisted of direct contact with at least 1 adult probable SARS case in 11 children, travel from a World Health Organization-designated affected area in Asia in 9 children, and presence in a Toronto area hospital in which secondary SARS spread had occurred in 5 children. The predominant clinical manifestations of probable cases were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. With the exception of 1 teenager, none of the children developed respiratory distress or an oxygen requirement, and all made full recoveries. Mild focal alveolar infiltrates were the predominant chest radiograph abnormality. Lymphopenia; neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; and elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase were present in some cases. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the SARS-associated coronavirus by an in-house reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 25 children. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that SARS is a relatively mild and nonspecific respiratory illness in previously healthy young children. The presence of fever in conjunction with a SARS exposure history should prompt one to consider SARS as a possible diagnosis in children irrespective of the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal specimens seems to be of little utility for the diagnosis of SARS during the early symptomatic phase of this illness in young children.","output":"Children hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related illness in Toronto."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that hit the world in 2019-2020 and caused massive losses Every day, hundreds of thousands of tests are being done on possible infected cases It usually takes several hours to get the results of virus test in advanced countries, whereas in other countries might take days The aim of this study is to investigate whether normal blood medical tests help in detecting covid-19 using various machine learning approaches If true, this would give an indication to people who should undergo the virus test In this paper we independently use machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, adaptive boosting, random forest and k-nearest neighbors These algorithms are then merged to form ensemble learning which leads to the classification The results show that the ensemble learning is having the highest true positive rate of 30% The obtained results show that normal blood tests do not help much in giving right indications about detecting COVID-19 ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Exploring the Relation between Blood Tests and Covid-19 Using Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is now clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of individuals, especially the most vulnerable ones such as students, we have very little knowledge about the long-term consequences. The objective of this study was to compare the mental health and coping of French university students during the different phases of the pandemic in the first 2 years. To this end, French university students were evaluated at four time points: during Frances first lockdown (AprilCMay 2020; n(T1) = 1357), the period after lockdown (June 2020; n(T2) = 309), 1 year after the first lockdown, which was also a lockdown period (AprilCMay 2021; n (T1) = 2569); and 1 year after the end of the first unlock (June 2021; n(T2) = 1136). Anxiety and depressive symptoms, coping and concerns were measured. In order to compare scores between the lockdown and unlock periods within the same year, paired samples t-tests were performed. To compare scores between the 2 years for different participants, independent samples t-tests were conducted. Our results showed that maladaptive strategies, concerns and symptoms were higher during lockdown periods, compared with unlock periods. In addition, symptom levels were higher in the second year of the pandemic compared with the first one. These argue that the psychological effects of COVID-19 were exacerbated by lockdowns but also by time.

The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon remains unclear, with many diverse and multifaceted hypotheses. To contribute to this understanding, we describe the underlying cardiac findings in fifty patients who died with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Included were autopsies performed on patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction test from the index hospitalization. In the case of out-of-hospital death, patients were included if post-mortem testing was positive. Complete autopsies were performed according to a COVID-19 safety protocol, and all patients underwent both macroscopic and microscopic examination. If available, laboratory findings and echocardiograms were reported. RESULTS: The median age of the decedents was 63.5 years. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (90.0%), diabetes (56.0%) and obesity (50.0%). Lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates in the heart were present in eight (16.0%) patients, with focal myocarditis present in two (4.0%) patients. Acute myocardial ischemia was observed in eight (16.0%) patients. The most common findings were myocardial fibrosis (80.0%), hypertrophy (72.0%), and microthrombi (66.0%). The most common causes of death were COVID-19 pneumonia in 18 (36.0%), COVID-19 pneumonia with bacterial superinfection in 12 (24.0%), and COVID-19 pneumonia with pulmonary embolism in 10 (20.0%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular comorbidities were prevalent, and pathologic changes associated with hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were the most common findings. Despite markedly elevated inflammatory markers and cardiac enzymes, few patients exhibited inflammatory infiltrates or necrosis within cardiac myocytes.

This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Findings: Nearly one in five (19?7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15?5% had a history of IPV and 10?1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Interpretation: Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

The immune transcriptomic overlap between Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19 has not been investigated. METHODS: we analyzed blood transcript levels of 50 genes known to predict IPF mortality in three COVID-19 and two IPF cohorts. The Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was applied to distinguish high versus low-risk profiles in all cohorts. SAMS cutoffs derived from the COVID-19 Discovery cohort were used to predict intensive care unit (ICU) status, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. A COVID-19 Single-cell RNA-sequencing cohort was used to identify the cellular sources of the 50-gene risk profiles. The same COVID-19 SAMS cutoffs were used to predict mortality in the IPF cohorts. FINDINGS: 50-gene risk profiles discriminated severe from mild COVID-19 in the Discovery cohort (P = 0015) and predicted ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality (AUC: 077, 075, and 074, respectively, P < 0001) in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. In COVID-19, 50-gene expressing cells with a high-risk profile included monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, while low-risk profile-expressing cells included CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, IgG producing plasmablasts, B cells, NK, and gamma/delta T cells. Same COVID-19 SAMS cutoffs were also predictive of mortality in the University of Chicago (HR:526, 95%CI:181-1527, P = 00013) and Imperial College of London (HR:431, 95%CI:181-1023, P = 00016) IPF cohorts.

One of the challenges in overcoming the influx of COVID-19 patients is controlling patient-to-staff transmission. Measuring the specific extent of ICU caregiver exposure to the virus and identifying the associated risk factors are, therefore, critical issues. We prospectively studied SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the staff of a hospital in Lyon, France, several weeks after a first epidemic wave. Risk factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified using a questionnaire survey. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 9% (87/971 subjects). Greater exposure was associated with higher seroprevalence, with a rate of 3.2% [95% CI 1.1-5.2%] among non-healthcare staff, 11.3% [8.9-13.7%] among all healthcare staff, and 16.3% [12.3-20.2%] among healthcare staff in COVID-19 units. The seroprevalence was dramatically lower (3.7% [1.0-6.7%]) in the COVID-19 ICU. Risk factors for seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-confirmed household (odds ratio (OR), 3.7 [1.8-7.4]), working in a COVID-19 unit (OR, 3.5 [2.2-5.7], and contact with a confirmed COVID-19 coworker (OR, 1.9 [1.2-3.1]). Conversely, working in the COVID-19-ICU was negatively associated with seropositivity (OR, 0.33 [0.15-0.73]). CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among staff than in the general population. Seropositivity rates were particularly high for staff in contact with COVID-19 patients, especially those in the emergency department and in the COVID-19 unit, but were much lower in ICU staff.

There are high chances of getting false positives and false negatives identifying the COVID-19 symptoms through existing medical practices such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). It might lead to a community spread of the disease. The alternative of these tests can be CT (Computer Tomography) imaging or X-rays of the lungs to identify the patient with COVID-19 symptoms more accurately. Furthermore, by using feasible and usable technology to automate the identification of COVID-19, the facilities can be improved.

METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all COVID-19-related social media posts made by leading alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage brands (n=42) and their parent companies (n=12) over a 4-month period (February to May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. RESULTS: Nearly 80% of included brands and all parent companies posted content related to COVID-19 during the 4-month period. Quick service restaurants (QSRs), food and alcohol delivery companies, alcohol brands, and bottle shops were the most active in posting COVID-19-related content. The most common themes for COVID-19-related marketing were isolation activities and community support. Promotion of hygiene and home delivery was also common, particularly for QSRs and alcohol and food delivery companies. Parent companies were more likely to post about corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as donations of money and products, and to offer health advice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that Big Food and Big Alcohol are incessantly marketing their products and brands on social media platforms using themes related to COVID-19, such as isolation activities and community support.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The total number of newly diagnosed cases of oral submucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers, recorded at two dental institutional settings before lockdown (January-March 2020) and after lockdown (June-August 2020), were included retrospectively and compared. RESULTS The study included a total of 797 cases at both institutions. At Institution-I, a total of 312 cases were recorded before the lockdown, and 63 cases were recorded after the lockdown. At Institution-II, a total of 311 cases were reported before lockdown, and 111 cases were recorded after lockdown. Comparisons between the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown data yielded a significant change in the proportions of oral sub-mucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers at both institutions (Chi-square test; p < 0.001). Following the lockdown, a substantial reduction was observed in the proportion of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) cases at both institutions, and the proportion of oral cancers increased at both institutions. There was a significant difference between the proportions of cases reported before lockdown at both institutions (p < 0.001). However, after-lockdown, no such differences were noted (p = 0.69); the absence of significance could most likely be due to the low sample size or low-power during the post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION The oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral cancer (OC) patient volumes reduced substantially following lockdown. During the post-lockdown period, the proportion of oral cancers increased, whereas the proportion of OSMF cases decreased. Results indicate that OPMD and oral cancer patients were impacted differently by the lockdown.

The current study prospectively compared 48 patients with septic shock and 22 patients with critical COVID-19 regarding their clinical characteristics and outcomes, as well as key plasmatic soluble biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation, endothelial activation, platelet activation, and NETosis. Forty-eight patients with matched age, gender, and co-morbidities were used as controls.

RESEARCH AIM: To explore public opinion about breastfeeding beyond infancy and public breastfeeding. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study participants were recruited from public spaces in Nova Scotia, Canada. Using photo elicitation methods, participants (N = 229) viewed six photographs of breastfeeding children aged 2 weeks, 13 months, and 2.5 years, one photograph captured at home, and the other in a public space (a caf, a store, or outdoors). Participants were asked to score their self-rated comfort with each photograph on a 10.0 cm visual analog scale and asked to share their feelings about each photograph (open-ended responses). RESULTS: Mean (SD) visual analog scale comfort scores for photographs differed by location (private, 7.9 [2.2]; public, 7.3 [2.6]; p < .05) and child age (2 weeks, 8.5 [2.0]; 13 months, 7.5 [2.6]; 2.5 years, 6.9 [3.0]; p < .05). Participants who identified as women and parents self-reported significantly higher comfort with all photographs, while younger participants and urban dwellers were generally less comfortable. Open-ended responses varied considerably, but a higher proportion of negative comments were reported for older children feeding in public spaces (e.g., 2.5-year-old in public: Inappropriate. Indecent. Abnormal.). CONCLUSION: Given the importance of social norms in supporting breastfeeding, future public health campaigns should strive to normalize breastfeeding beyond infancy, and in public spaces.","output":"Article: Too Old and Too Cold: Discomfort Towards Photographs of Breastfeeding Beyond Infancy and Public Breastfeeding in Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consumption of food for pleasure is mainly associated with adverse health effects. This review was carried out to verify recent reports on the impact of chocolate and wine consumption on cardiovascular health, with a particular focus on atherosclerosis. On one side, these products have proven adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, but on the other hand, if consumed in optimal amounts, they have cardiovascular benefits. The submitted data suggest that the beneficial doses are 30C50 g and 130/250 mL for chocolate and wine, respectively, for women and men. The accumulated evidence indicates that the active ingredients in the products under consideration in this review are phenolic compounds, characterized by anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiplatelet properties. However, there are also some reports of cardioprotective properties of other compounds such as esters, amines, biogenic amines, amino acids, fatty acids, mineral ingredients, and vitamins. Our narrative review has shown that in meta-analyses of intervention studies, consumption of chocolate and wine was positively associated with the beneficial outcomes associated with the cardiovascular system. In contrast, the assessment with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) scale did not confirm this phenomenon. In addition, mechanisms of action of bioactive compounds present in chocolate and wine depend on some factors, such as age, sex, body weight, and the presence of additional medical conditions. Patients using cardiovascular drugs simultaneously with both products should be alert to the risk of pharmacologically relevant interactions during their use. Our narrative review leads to the conclusion that there is abundant evidence to prove the beneficial impact of consuming both products on cardiovascular health, however some evidence still remains controversial. Many authors of studies included in this review postulated that well-designed, longitudinal studies should be performed to determine the effects of these products and their components on atherosclerosis and other CVD (Cardiovascular Disease) disease.","output":"Cardiovascular Effects of Chocolate and WineNarrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with pre-existing cardiac conditions as well as cardiovascular complications.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the reproductive numbers (R) for each epidemic stage to analyze the effects of the preventive measures and to predict the COVID-19 transmission trends. METHODS: We estimated the transmission rates for each epidemic stage by fitting a COVID-19 transmission model, based on a deterministic mathematical model, to the data on confirmed cases. The effects of preventive measures such as social distancing by time period were analyzed, and the size and trends of future COVID-19 outbreaks were estimated. RESULTS: The value of R was 3.53 from February18, 2020 to February 28, 2020, and the mean R reduced to 0.45 from March 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020, but it significantly increased to 2.69 from April 30, 2020 to May13, 2020 and it was maintained at 1.03 from May 14, 2020 to July 23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: According to the estimated R, it had fallen to below 1 and was maintained at that level owing to the isolation of infected persons by the public health authorities and social distancing measures followed by the general public. Then, the estimated R increased rapidly as the contact among individuals increased during the long holiday period from April 30, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Thereafter, the value of R dropped, with the continued use of preventive measures but remained higher than 1.00, indicating that the COVID-19 outbreak can be prolonged and develop into a severe outbreak at any time.","output":"Analyzing the effects of social distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea using mathematical modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a worldwide impact on all health services, including childhood immunizations. In Canada, there is limited data to quantify and characterize this issue. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by distributing online surveys to physicians across Ontario. The survey included three sections: provider characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, and impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization services. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with modification of immunization services. RESULTS: A total of 475 respondents answered the survey from May 27th to July 3rd 2020, including 189 family physicians and 286 pediatricians. The median proportion of in-person visits reported by physicians before the pandemic was 99% and dropped to 18% during the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario. In total, 175 (44.6%) of the 392 respondents who usually provide vaccination to children acknowledged a negative impact caused by the pandemic on their immunization services, ranging from temporary closure of their practice (n = 18; 4.6%) to postponement of vaccines in certain age groups (n = 103; 26.3%). Pediatricians were more likely to experience a negative impact on their immunization services compared to family physicians (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.48-4.68), as well as early career physicians compared to their more senior colleagues (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.30-5.56), whereas physicians from suburban settings were less impacted than physicians from urban settings (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99). Some of the proposed solutions to decreased immunization services included assistance in accessing personal protective equipment, dedicated centers or practices for vaccination, universal centralized electronic immunization records and education campaigns for parents. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has caused substantial modifications to pediatric immunization services across Ontario.

Its application fields range from medical research, to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to population dynamics. The literature on molecular phylogenetics proposes a number of criteria for selecting a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. Usually, such criteria can be expressed by means of objective functions, and the phylogenies that optimize them are referred to as optimal. One of the most important estimation criteria is the parsimony which states that the optimal phylogeny T(?)for a set [Formula: see text] of n haplotype sequences over a common set of variable loci is the one that satisfies the following requirements: (i) it has the shortest length and (ii) it is such that, for each pair of distinct haplotypes [Formula: see text] , the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h(i) to h(j) in T(?) is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h(i) and h(j). Finding the most parsimonious phylogeny for [Formula: see text] involves solving an optimization problem, called the Most Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem (MPPEP), which is [Formula: see text]-hard in many of its versions. RESULTS: In this article we investigate a recent version of the MPPEP that arises when input data consist of single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes extracted from a population of individuals on a common genomic region. Specifically, we explore the prospects for improving on the implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy used in previous work using a novel problem formulation and a series of strengthening valid inequalities and preliminary symmetry breaking constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies. We present the basic formulation and then introduce a series of provable valid constraints to reduce the solution space. We then prove that these constraints can often lead to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. CONCLUSION: We provide an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches.","output":"A mixed integer linear programming model to reconstruct phylogenies from single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes under the maximum parsimony criterion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 is expanding worldwide, kidney involvement seems to be part of the spectrum of its effects.

However, large-scale studies of COVID-19 mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to influenza and individuals tested negative for COVID-19 are lacking. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 30-day mortality and newonset comorbidity compared to individuals with negative COVID-19 test results and individuals tested for influenza. Methods and findings This population-based cohort study utilized electronic health records covering roughly half (n=2,647,229) of Denmark's population, with nationwide linkage of microbiology test results and death records. All individuals []18 years tested for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza were followed from November 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020. The main outcome was 30-day mortality after a test for either COVID-19 or influenza. Secondary outcomes were major comorbidity diagnoses 30-days after the test for either COVID-19 or influenza. In total, 224,639 individuals were tested for COVID-19. Among inpatients positive for COVID-19, 356 of 1657 (21%) died within 30 days, which was a 3.0 to 3.1-fold increased 30-day mortality rate, when compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative inpatients (all p<0.001). For outpatients, 128 of 6,263 (2%) COVID-19-positive patients died within 30 days, which was a 5.5 to 6.9-fold increased mortality rate compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative patients, respectively (all p<0.001). Compared to hospitalized patients with influenza, new-onset ischemic stroke, diabetes and nephropathy occurred more frequently in inpatients with COVID-19 (all p<0.05). Conclusions In this population-based study comparing COVID-19 with influenza, COVID-19 was associated with increased rates of major systemic and vascular comorbidity and substantially higher mortality, which is likely even higher than the stated 3.0 to 5.5-fold increase owing to more extensive testing for COVID-19.","output":"30-day mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 versus influenza: A populationbased study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the mandated social distancing and restricted market activities have adversely affected the employment and earnings of the poor who are considered the targeted beneficiaries of the Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) The MFI operation and more specifically fresh lending are under serious threat as the mode of operations primarily involve physical interaction while distributing credits at the clients' doorsteps, conducting periodic group meetings and carrying out regular collections This short article attempts to analyze the various challenges that MFIs may encounter in their current and future operations due to the ongoing pandemic It discusses how the government initiated coping mechanisms may help MFIs overcome or minimize the pandemic challenges At the same time, MFIs' efforts towards continued services are expected to create a win-win situation","output":"Covid-19 pandemic: Challenges and ways forward for the Indian microfinance institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread almost all regions of the world and caused great loss to the whole body of mankind.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the COVID-19 medicine. METHODS: Studies were determined through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline. The studies of COVID-19 medicine were involved with eligible end points containing mortality, discharge rate, rate of clinical improvement, and rate of serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies involving 37,879 patients were included in our study, whose intervening measures contained three major types of COVID-19 medicine, ACEI/ARB, antiviral medicine, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Compared to control group, COVID-19 drugs have no distinct effect on mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11, Pa=a.43) and discharge rate (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14, Pa=a.13). However, antiviral medicine presents the obvious advantage in clinical improvement (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23, Pa<a.05). In addition, the serious adverse events rate (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88, Pa<a.05) of COVID-19 medicine is lower than control group. CONCLUSION: The results indicated antiviral medicine was potential specific medicine for COVID-19 treatment by improving clinical symptoms, but it failed to increase the discharge rate and reduce mortality. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and ACEI/ARB had no significant effect on treatment of COVID-19, thus they were not recommended for routine medication.

METHODS: We used the provincial British Columbia Cardiac Arrest Registry, including non-traumatic emergency medical system (EMS)-assessed OHCA, to compare suicide-related OHCA (defined as clear self-harm or a priori communication of intent) one-year prior to, and one year after, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020). We calculated differences in incidence (with 95% CI), overall and within subgroups of mechanism (hanging, suffocation, poisoning, or unclear mechanism), and in case characteristics and hospital-discharge favourable neurological outcomes (CPC 1-2). RESULTS: Of 13,785 EMS-assessed OHCA, we included 274/6430 (4.3%) pre-pandemic and 221/7355 (3.0%) pandemic-period suicide-related cases.

Patient characteristics and hospital discharge outcomes between periods were similar. CONCLUSION: Suicide-related OHCA incidence decreased with the COVID-19 pandemic and we did not detect changes in patient characteristics or outcomes, suggesting that suicide is not a contributor to increases in COVID-related OHCA incidence or mortality.

Thirty-two acute-care hospitals were required to report their previous day's unscheduled admissions for 11 syndromes (pneumonia, hemoptysis, respiratory distress, acute neurologic illness, nontraumatic paralysis, sepsis and nontraumatic shock, fever with rash, fever of unknown cause, acute gastrointestinal illness, and possible cutaneous anthrax, and suspected illness clusters). Admissions for pneumonia, gastrointestinal illness, and sepsis were reported most frequently; admissions for fever with rash, possible cutaneous anthrax, and hemoptysis were rare.

The cumulative incidence rates of incident disability in each group were also estimated (robust, 9.6/1,000 person-years (95% CI 7.9 to 11.7); cognitive impairment, 21.3/1,000 person years (95% CI 16.3 to 27.7); frailty, 45.4/1,000 person years (95% CI 39.5 to 52.3); and cognitive frailty, 79.9/1,000 person years (95% CI 68.6 to 93.1)). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard model revealed that the cognitive frailty group had the highest hazard ratio (HR 3.86, 95%CI 2.95 - 5.05, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A proper operational definition was developed to determine cognitive frailty among elderlies. Cognitive frailty is more associated with incident disability in community-setting than cognitive impairment or physical frailty alone.","output":"Cognitive Frailty as a Risk Factor for Incident Disability During Late Life: A 24-Month Follow-Up Longitudinal Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between March 5th and July 25th, 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was 10,090, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 285.7/100,000 population.

Here we share the donor presentations evaluated in a lung transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken at every stage of transplant management, and the outcomes of our transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 15 lung donors selected by the national coordination center pre - sented to our lung transplant center as of March 11, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkey, and data of 5 lung transplant cases in this period were retrospectively analyzed. All donors were examined in detail for COVID-19 disease. Procurement processes for accepted donors, transplant surgeries of recipients, and postoperative follow-up and care processes of recipients were carried out with the least number of personnel, but all with appropriate personal protective equipment. RESULTS There were 15 donor organs procured by our center during a 9-month period coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of donor pre - sentations to our center between the same dates in the previous year was 78. Five of the 15 donors were accepted, and of those accepted, 4 were male and 1 was female. There was no statistically significant difference between the accepted and rejected donors in terms of the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, age, duration of endotracheal intubation (days), and smoking (pack-years). All SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests performed on bronchoalveolar lavage samples and nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, and rectal samples collected from the recipients during the follow-up period were negative. No pathological finding suggestive of COVID-19 infection was noted in the radiological evaluations. CONCLUSIONS Lung transplant can be successfully managed during the COVID-19 pandemic period, despite the high risk of infection. The major obstacle to the continuity of lung transplant in this period was the limited number of donors.","output":"Donor Lung Evaluation and Lung Transplantation in the COVID-19 Era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a reflexive analysis of how university educators experience the shift to increasing online teaching in 2019. We explore what it means to be an online educator in contemporary higher education and aim to raise questions about how we approach online education and understand ourselves as educators, informed by a sociomaterial lens. The research utilised collaborative autoethnography (CAE) to facilitate meaning\\\\making and uncover complex perspectives through collaboration and conversation. This enabled us to question what we as educators were losing and what we were gaining as a consequence of shifting to more online modes of teaching via university mandated platforms and processes. Through this methodology, various themes emerged: the role of corporeality;how we constructed ourselves through texts;how others materialised us in virtual spaces;the experience of online time;and our transforming practices and identities. This paper provides a snapshot of a significant cultural milieu in academia as we were afforded time to engage in reflexive practice about teaching online just as the academic world was abruptly mandated to shift almost wholly online. It also provides unique insights into the significance of understanding ourselves as both embodied and social, and the importance of community within academia. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Higher education's shift online, both before and during COVID, has had a substantial effect on university staff, including discomfort and loss of agency. What this paper adds Considering the material and embodied is important in online education, particularly because it can be taken\\\\for\\\\granted and hence overlooked. Feelings of disconnection can result from the inevitable gap between how educators represent themselves online and how others perceive (materialise) them online.

The virus essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex is targeted by several nucleoside/tide analogues whose mechanisms of action and clinical potential are currently evaluated. The guanosine analogue AT-527, a double prodrug of its 5'-triphosphate AT-9010, is currently in phase III clinical trials as a COVID19 treatment. Here we report the cryo-EM structure at 2.98 ? resolution of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 complex with RNA showing AT-9010 bound at three sites of nsp12. At the RdRp active-site, one AT-9010 is incorporated into the RNA product. Its 2'-methyl group prevents correct alignment of a second AT-9010 occupying the incoming NTP pocket. The 2'-F, 2'-methyl 3'-OH ribose scaffold explains the non-obligate RNA chain-termination potency of this NA series for both HCV NS5 and SARS-CoV RTCs. A third AT-9010 molecule 5'-diphosphate binds to a coronavirus-specific pocket in the nsp12 N-terminus NiRAN domain, a SelO pseudo-kinase structural and functional homologue.

We aimed to determine whether serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels measured with a highly sensitive assay [high sensitivity cTnT (HS-cTnT)] may predict cardiovascular events (CVEs) in SLE. METHOD: All SLE patients included between 2007 and 2010 in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre PLUS trial were screened. Patients with no past history of CVE at inclusion and a follow-up period of >20 months were analysed. HS-cTnT concentration was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method on serum collected at PLUS inclusion. The primary outcome was the incident CVE. Factors associated with the primary outcome were identified and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 442 SLE patients (of the 573 included in the PLUS study) were analysed for the primary outcome with a median follow up of 110 (interquartile range: 99-120) months. Among them, 29 (6.6%) experienced at least one CVE that occurred at a median of 67 (interquartile range: 31-91) months after inclusion. Six out of 29 patients had more than one CVE. In the multivariate analysis, dyslipidaemia, age and HS-cTnT were associated with the occurrence of CVE. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a concentration of HS-cTnT > 4.27 ng/l at inclusion increased by 2.7 [hazard ratio 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6), P =0.0083] the risk of CVE in SLE.

Objectives: To examine differences in COVID-19 hospital mortality rates between Black and White patients and to assess whether the mortality rates reflect differences in patient characteristics by race or by the hospitals to which Black and White patients are admitted. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed Medicare beneficiaries admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 to 1188 US hospitals from January 1, 2020, through September 21, 2020. Exposure: Hospital admission for a diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary composite outcome was inpatient death or discharge to hospice within 30 days of admission. We estimated the association of patient-level characteristics (including age, sex, zip code-level income, comorbidities, admission from a nursing facility, and days since January 1, 2020) with differences in mortality or discharge to hospice among Black and White patients. To examine the association with the hospital itself, we adjusted for the specific hospitals to which patients were admitted. We used simulation modeling to estimate the mortality among Black patients had they instead been admitted to the hospitals where White patients were admitted. Results: Of the 44a?217 Medicare beneficiaries included in the study, 24a?281 (55%) were women; mean (SD) age was 76.3 (10.5) years; 33a?459 participants (76%) were White, and 10a?758 (24%) were Black. Overall, 2634 (8%) White patients and 1100 (10%) Black patients died as inpatients, and 1670 (5%) White patients and 350 (3%) Black patients were discharged to hospice within 30 days of hospitalization, for a total mortality-equivalent rate of 12.86% for White patients and 13.48% for Black patients. Black patients had similar odds of dying or being discharged to hospice (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12) in an unadjusted comparison with White patients. After adjustment for clinical and sociodemographic patient characteristics, Black patients were more likely to die or be discharged to hospice (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19). This difference became indistinguishable when adjustment was made for the hospitals where care was delivered (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10). In simulations, if Black patients in this sample were instead admitted to the same hospitals as White patients in the same distribution, their rate of mortality or discharge to hospice would decline from the observed rate of 13.48% to the simulated rate of 12.23% (95% CI for difference, 1.20%-1.30%). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that Black patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher rates of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice than White patients after adjustment for the personal characteristics of those patients. However, those differences were explained by differences in the hospitals to which Black and White patients were admitted.","output":"Patient and Hospital Factors Associated With Differences in Mortality Rates Among Black and White US Medicare Beneficiaries Hospitalized With COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has shown the ability to become aerosolized with a potential airborne route of transmission.

In a statement on interim guidance, WHO recommended that all routine dental procedures be delayed until COVID-19 transmission rates decrease from community transmission to cluster cases and until the risk of transmission in a dental office can be studied and evaluated. This prospective study involves 2,810 patients treated over a 6-month period (March 15 to September 15, 2020) in three different dental offices by two dentists and three hygienists during and shortly after the height of the pandemic in New York.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)is a critical regulator in the pathogenesis of this disease. We focused on two key RAS enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to elucidate the activation of the ACE-angiotensin II (Ang II)-angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) axis and the inhibition of the ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]-Mas receptor axis in C57BL/6mice following SiO2 treatment. Silica exposure caused nodule formation, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix, and impaired lung function in mice. These effects were attenuated by the inhibition of ACE (captopril), blockade of the AT1(losartan), or systemic knockdown of the Ace gene. These effects were exacerbated by the inhibition of ACE2 (MLN-4760), blockade of the Mas (A779), or knockdown of the Ace2 gene. N-Acetyl-Seryl-Asparyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP), an anti-fibrotic peptide, ameliorated the silica-exposure-induced pathological changes by targeting the RAS system by activating the protective ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis and inhibiting the deleterious ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis, thereby exerting a protective effect. This was confirmed in mouse lung type II epithelial cells (MLE-12) pretreated with Ang II and/or gene silencing separately targeting Ace and Ace2.The effects of Ac-SDKP were similar to those produced by Ace gene silencing and were partly attenuated by Ace2 deficiency. These findings suggested that RAS plays critical roles in the pathomechanism of silicosis fibrosis and that Ac-SDKP regulates lung RAS to inhibit EMT in silicotic mice and MLE-12 cells.","output":"N-Acetyl-Seryl-Asparyl-Lysyl-Proline regulates lung renin angiotensin system to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition in silicotic mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Because of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, many primary care practices have transitioned to telehealth visits to keep patients at home and decrease the transmission of the disease. Yet, little is known about the nationwide capacity for delivering primary care services via telehealth. METHODS Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey we estimated the number and proportion of reported visits and services that could be provided via telehealth. We also performed cross-tabulations to calculate the number and proportion of physicians providing telephone visits and e-mail/internet encounters. RESULTS Of the total visits (nearly 400 million) to primary care physicians, 42% were amenable to telehealth and 73% of the total services rendered could be delivered through telehealth modalities. Of the primary care physicians, 44% provided telephone consults and 19% provided e-consults. DISCUSSION This study underscores how and where primary care services could be delivered. It provides the first estimates of the capacity of primary care to provide telehealth services for COVID-19 related illness, and for several other acute and chronic medical conditions. It also highlights the fact that, as of 2016, most outpatient telehealth visits were done via telephone.

The causal agent, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, tends to evolve rapidly upon sequential applications of chemical fungicides and generate new progeny possessing tolerance to such fungicides. Glycoproteins represent an environmentally safe alternative for chemically synthetized fungicides and do not trigger fungicide resistance. We studied the antifungal activity of four glycoproteins namely soybean -conglycinin, chickpea vicilin, duck egg ovomucin and catfish p22 against Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Ten commercial fungicides of different chemical groups were used as positive controls of glycoprotein treatments. RESULTS The results revealed that soybean -conglycinin and catfish p22 glycoproteins possess significant antifungal activity against P. cubensis. The amount of disease suppression caused by -conglycinin and p22 was comparable to the highly efficient chemical fungicides containing copper oxychloride, cymoxanil and fosetyl Al as active ingredients. Vicilin and ovomucin were less efficient biocides as they gave moderate suppression of disease severity. However, all tested glycoproteins provided full protection for the newly emerged cucumber leaves. Microscopic examination of glycoprotein-treated leaves inferred the ability of catfish p22 and soybean -conglycinin to disrupt the integrity of sporangial cell walls of P. cubensis rendering them nonviable comparing to untreated ones. Expression levels of total phenolic compounds and the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were elevated upon glycoproteins application, which infers their involvement in disease suppression.

The articles over-arching research question centres around how European countries responded to the 2020 pandemic, especially in regard to the types of care need that were recognized, the resources committed, the actors/agency that were supported or taken for granted and the values underpinning the responses. What we find from the review is that, while care assumed a strong place in public rhetoric, this was not reflected in greater public resourcing of care for young children or long-term care. Instead, care for children was refamilialized and long-term care was under-resourced and relegated to a secondary position; both were in many ways rendered further dependent on the private agency of individuals. In sum, the pandemic spearheaded some reversion to old practices and the opportunity to invest in care as a human need, a basis of rights and entitlements and a valued activity was not availed of.","output":"COVID-19, Social Policy and Care: A Complex Set of Processes and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has initiated a global pandemic, and several vaccines have now received emergency use authorization. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semipermissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of viral RNA (vRNA) at multiple time points, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in 2 respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against reinfection, ferrets were rechallenged 28 or 56 days postinfection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined, these studies demonstrate direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate in ferrets and that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show that the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against reinfection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest that protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","output":"Transmission and Protection against Reinfection in the Ferret Model with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 Reference Isolate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 and remarked on the relevance of studying its consequences on mental health.

The data document quantitative trait loci (QTL) with statistically significant effects on CD4, CD8, and CD8 memory T cells, and on subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells that express P-glycoprotein. Some of the loci detected were robust, in the sense that they produced effects of similar size both in mated female mice, and in a population that included male and female virgin animals. Some of the effects were stable, in that they were apparent at both 8 and 18 months of age, but others were age-specific, showing effects either at 8 or at 18 months but not at both ages. Genes that had an effect on the same T cell subset were in almost all cases additive rather than epistatic, and their combined effects could produce large overall effects, leading in the most dramatic case to a two-fold difference in CD8 memory cells. The analysis also documented two QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 13, that regulate an age-sensitive composite index of T cell subset pattern which has been shown previously to be a predictor of life expectancy in these mice.

Further, more than 83% of the participants reported using social media frequently during the pandemic. We found that exposure to misinformation via social media has a significant positive relationship with anxiety, depression, and social isolation. However, Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it cannot be determined whether social media causes negative mental health outcomes, or if individuals experiencing greater depression, anxiety and social isolation turn to social media more than others, or if some third variable might explain both. Based on our findings, we present specific suggestions related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the government of Saudi Arabia. Minoring and filtering out misleading information with the cooperation of the World Health Organization (WHO) can promote the spread of accurate news in Saudi Arabia.","output":"Psychosocial effects of social media on the Saudi society during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The work in the production of animal protein in slaughterhouses involves the exposure to several occupational risk factors. At present, it has been recently associated with the pandemic context related to the biological agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The slaughterhouse sector has been shown to be a critical focus of concentration and spread of cases in Brazil and worldwide. Among the strategies adopted for workers protection, there is a clear need for collective protection, supplemented by individual protection. With regard to SARS-CoV-2 and to the risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), respiratory protection is essential and well-established by the competent agencies and by the scientific community, since the respiratory route is considered the route of transmission and of risk of contagion. The aim of this review was to analyze the indication of use with regard to the frequency for changing respiratory protectors when working at slaughterhouses. The study involved a literature review, conducted on databases available on the internet. The search considered journal articles, dissertations, and theses published in Portuguese and English on scientific data bases from 2006 to 2020.

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of face mask use in a community setting and to predict the effectiveness of wearing a mask. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Library, and pre-prints from inception to 22 April 2020 without restriction by language. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane and GRADE approach. Findings: Our search identified 35 studies, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (4,017 patients), 10 comparative studies (18,984 patients), 13 predictive models, nine laboratory experimental studies. For reducing infection rates, the estimates of cluster-RCTs were in favor of wearing face masks vs. no mask, but not at statistically significant levels (adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78C1.05). Similar findings were reported in observational studies. Mathematical models indicated an important decrease in mortality when the population mask coverage is near-universal, regardless of mask efficacy. In the best-case scenario, when the mask efficacy is at 95%, the R0 can fall to 0.99 from an initial value of 16.90. Levels of mask filtration efficiency were heterogeneous, depending on the materials used (surgical mask: 45C97%). One laboratory study suggested a viral load reduction of 0.25 (95% CI 0.09C0.67) in favor of mask vs. no mask.

INTRODUCTION Occupational therapists report barriers to conducting research due to the complexities of clinical practice, and lack of knowledge, time, and resources. Case study research is generating interest as a potentially manageable and practical solution to increase research engagement. However, it is not clear how this is being utilized by occupational therapists or how feasible it is to contribute to the evidence base. INCLUSION CRITERIA Opinion, text, and empirical studies that explicitly use or discuss case study research methodology within an occupational therapy context will be included. Studies will be excluded where the occupational therapy context cannot be clearly defined, for example, where they are multi-disciplinary focused or where a case study research design is not explicit (eg, a descriptive case report without data collection). All countries and practice settings will be included. METHODS A three-step search following JBI methodology will be conducted across databases and websites for English-language, published peer-reviewed and gray literature from 1990. Study selection will be completed by two independent reviewers.

METHODS: This correlational retrospective study evaluated n=319 COVID-19 patients admitted to acute inpatient services across the Mercy Health Youngstown hospitals. A retrospective chart audit included home medications and admission medications, hospital and ICU length of stay, days on the ventilator, initial and follow-up labs (D-dimer), and thromboembolic events after diagnosis of COVID-19. We constructed a composite index for any embolic events occurring in inpatient: MI, DVT, PE, stroke, and cardiac arrest. The prevalence of these embolic events was 23.5% (n=75/319). For propensity modeling, comorbidities, initial D-dimer, demographics, days from a positive COVID-19 test result to admission, and a summative index of comorbidities were entered in a binary logistic regression model to predict embolic events. RESULTS: The rate of any embolic events among COVID inpatients was 23.5% (n=75/319). Initial D-dimer was 16481702 ng/mL among patients experiencing any embolic events and was lower among patients without embolic events, 10091205 ng/mL (t=3.638, p < 0.001). In iterative forward selection, logistic modeling retained in the model for embolic events were age, initial D-dimer, past medical history of ESRD, and ethnicity, which correctly classified 75% of embolic events in patients (AUC=0.702). The addition of home medications, antiplatelets and anticoagulants to the propensity model did not significantly improve AUC (0.704) which indicates that neither home use of anticoagulation nor antiplatelets was associated with inpatient embolic events in a propensity adjusted model. However, when inpatient anticoagulation therapy was initiated, statistically significant benefit in preventing embolic events was observed (AOR = 3.32 (95% CI 1.79-6.16);AUC 0.752 (p < 0.001)). Similarly, home use of antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients, but in-hospital use of anticoagulation was statistically significant (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Our study aimed to see if taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications as a home medication would have any effect on thromboembolic events and mortality in COVID-19 patients compared to when receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents during hospitalization. We found that being on an antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication at home (before hospitalization) did not prevent COVID-19 patients from thromboembolic events or improve mortality. However, after adjusting for baseline risk of embolic events, in-hospital anticoagulation had a statistically significant benefit in preventing embolic events and mortality. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It has been established that COVID-19 patients are at higher risk for embolic events that have been linked to increased mortality. In our current study using a composite index model to predict embolic events in COVID-19 patients, the use of anticoagulation agents during hospitalization revealed a significant reduction in embolic risks and mortality while patients on home antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications did not show benefits in reducing the same risks.

Ground Glass Opacity (GGO) and consolidation of chest CT scans have been an essential basis for imaging diagnosis since 2020. The similarity of imaging features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia makes it challenging to distinguish between them and affects radiologists' diagnosis. Recently, deep learning in COVID-19 has been mainly divided into disease classification and lesion segmentation, yet little work has focused on the feature correlation between the two tasks. To address these issues, in this study, we propose MultiR-Net, a 3D deep learning model for combined COVID-19 classification and lesion segmentation, to achieve real-time and interpretable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. Precisely, the proposed network consists of two subnets: a multi-scale feature fusion UNet-like subnet for lesion segmentation and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. The features between the two subnets are fused by the reverse attention mechanism and the iterable training strategy. Meanwhile, we proposed a loss function to enhance the interaction between the two subnets. Individual metrics can not wholly reflect network effectiveness. Thus we quantify the segmentation results with various evaluation metrics such as average surface distance, volume Dice, and test on the dataset. We employ a dataset containing 275 3D CT scans for classifying COVID-19, Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and healthy people and segmented lesions in pneumonia patients. We split the dataset into 70% and 30% for training and testing. Extensive experiments showed that our multi-task model framework obtained an average recall of 93.323%, an average precision of 94.005% on the classification test set, and a 69.95% Volume Dice score on the segmentation test set of our dataset.","output":"MultiR-Net: A Novel Joint Learning Network for COVID-19 segmentation and classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Countries around the world are facing extraordinary challenges in implementing various measures to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Guided by international recommendations, Saudi Arabia has implemented a series of infection control measures after the detection of the first confirmed case in the country. However, in order for these measures to be effective, public attitudes and compliance must be conducive as perceived risk is strongly associated with health behaviors. The primary objective of this study is to assess Saudisattitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures to guide future health communication content. Methods: Na?ve Bayes machine learning model was used to run Arabic sentiment analysis of Twitter posts through the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. Tweets containing hashtags pertaining to seven public health measures imposed by the government were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 53,127 tweets were analyzed. All measures, except one, showed more positive tweets than negative. Measures that pertain to religious practices showed the most positive sentiment. Discussion: Saudi Twitter users showed support and positive attitudes towards the infection control measures to combat COVID-19. It is postulated that this conducive public response is reflective of the overarching, longstanding popular confidence in the government. Religious notions may also play a positive role in preparing believers at times of crises.

Previous work, in both animal models and humans, supports the role of zinc in improving glucose homeostasis. We, therefore, aimed to test the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on glycaemic control in pre-diabetic adults. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across 10 General Practitioner (GP) practices in NSW, Australia. The trial is known as Zinc in Preventing the Progression of pre-Diabetes (ZIPPeD)Study. Pre-diabetic (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7C6.4%, 39C46 mmol/mol) men and women (N = 98) were all assigned to a free state government telephone health coaching service (New South Wales Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) and then randomised to either daily 30 mg zinc gluconate or placebo. Blood tests were collected at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months for the primary outcomes (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG)); secondary outcomes included Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA 2) parameters, lipids, body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse. RESULTS: The baseline-adjusted mean group difference at 6 months, expressed as treatmentCplacebo, (95% CI) was ?0.02 (?0.14, 0.11, p = 0.78) for HbA1c and 0.17 (?0.07, 0.42; p = 0.17) for FBG, neither of which were statistically significant. There were also no significant differences between groups in any of the secondary outcomes. Zinc was well tolerated, and compliance was high (88%). CONCLUSION: We believe our results are consistent with other Western clinical trial studies and do not support the use of supplemental zinc in populations with a Western diet.

These beliefs have resulted in substantive, negative real-world outcomes but remain largely unstudied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey (n=660). Participants were asked about the believability of five selected COVID-19 narratives, their political orientation, their religious commitment, and their trust in science (a 21-item scale), along with sociodemographic items. Data were assessed descriptively, then latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar believability profiles. Bivariate (ANOVA) analyses were run, then multivariable, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with membership in specific COVID-19 narrative believability profiles. RESULTS: For the full sample, believability of the narratives varied, from a low of 1.94 (SD=1.72) for the 5G narrative to a high of 5.56 (SD=1.64) for the zoonotic (scientific consensus) narrative. Four distinct belief profiles emerged, with the preponderance (70%) of the sample falling into Profile 1, which believed the scientifically accepted narrative (zoonotic origin) but not the misinformed or conspiratorial narratives. Other profiles did not disbelieve the zoonotic explanation, but rather believed additional misinformation to varying degrees. Controlling for sociodemographics, political orientation and religious commitment were marginally, and typically non-significantly, associated with COVID-19 belief profile membership. However, trust in science was a strong, significant predictor of profile membership, with lower trust being substantively associated with belonging to Profiles 2 through 4. CONCLUSIONS: Belief in misinformation or conspiratorial narratives may not be mutually exclusive from belief in the narrative reflecting scientific consensus; that is, profiles were distinguished not by belief in the zoonotic narrative, but rather by concomitant belief or disbelief in additional narratives. Additional, renewed dissemination of scientifically accepted narratives may not attenuate belief in misinformation. However, prophylaxis of COVID-19 misinformation might be achieved by taking concrete steps to improve trust in science and scientists, such as building understanding of the scientific process and supporting open science initiatives.","output":"Misinformation about COVID-19: evidence for differential latent profiles and a strong association with trust in science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 are being approved, the number of available doses is limited as it may take months until the production of vaccines can meet the actual demand.

Such a strategic vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce hospitalizations, and reduce fatalities. Yet, the conditions which make single-dose vaccination favorable over prime-boost administrations are not well understood. Here, we formulate a model that helps explore these decisive conditions as a function of the various time scales and epidemiological mechanisms at work. We study how these conditions arise from disease prevalence, vaccination rates, basic reproduction number, prime and prime-boost efficacies, prime-boost intervals, and waning rates. By combining epidemiological modeling, random sampling techniques, and decision tree learning, we find that prime-first vaccination is robustly favored over prime-boost vaccination campaigns, even for high vaccination rates, high disease prevalence, and a relatively low single-dose efficacy.","output":"Decisive Conditions for Strategic Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In terms of the absolute number of COVID-19 positive cases, India is among the top four countries in the world There is a lot of unwarranted criticism about the alleged inadequacy of COVID-19 testing in India The facts available from international and publicly available online non-government source covering the entire world show otherwise While India is fourth in terms of an absolute number of cases, its rank is 132nd in terms of cases per million population and 107th for deaths per million population These are indications that India is doing much better in the battle against COVID-19 than it is getting credit for The correct benchmark for the adequacy of testing is the percentage of COVID-19 positive results as compared to the total number of tests performed India ranks 5th (out of 215) in this respect - being better than some western countries such as the USA, Spain, and France Thus, the Indian strategy for COVID-19 testing is better and more appropriate than the majority of other countries with the large absolute number of positive cases","output":"COVID-19 testing in India in comparison to the rest of the world. if Indian testing strategy was replicated in the other top 15 COVID-19 affected countries in the world, the status would be startlingly different"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABO blood groups have recently been related to COVID19 infection.

The level and depth of these changes vary and depend on the power of external influence and system reservation mechanisms. The art of managing system processes consists of two main aspects. The first aspect involves the sagacity of managers and predicting general environmental change trends (and their impacts on the managed system). The second involves adjusting to these trends, maximizing possible benefits, and minimizing the negative manifestations of this process. Innovation plays an important role, contributing to system transformations with maximal effect and minimal loss. Public transport systems are important elements in cities, as they provide spatial mobility for at least half of the citizens of a city who cannot use individual transportation. Modern urbanization and peculiarities of the socialCeconomic statuses of many citizens contribute to the fact that organized public transportation is unprofitable. The low solvency of citizens who use public transportation services means that passenger transport systems do not work with enough profitability. As a result, governing institutions often choose to subsidize unprofitable transporter activities, thereby prolonging the functioning of unprofitable routes. This is possible only in conditions of sustainability (in regards to a non-optimal system), when the environment is calm, and its negative impact is low. Black swans (according to N. Taleb) are bifurcation factors that break the sustainability of non-optimal system. Urban public transport (UPT) of a large Russian city, Tyumen, experienced it in 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 lockdown. The sharp decrease in population mobility in Tyumen, in 2020C2021, caused the need for a complete transformation of the transport service system. However, managers did not want to fundamentally change a system that consensually suited most counterparties.

We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a spectrum of 3D-printed models in teaching CHD to medical students. RESULTS: We performed a prospective, randomized educational procedure to teach fifth year medical students four CHDs (atrial septal defect (ASD, n = 74), ventricular septal defect (VSD, n = 50), coarctation of aorta (CoA, n = 118) and tetralogy of Fallot (ToF, n = 105)). Students were randomized into printing groups or control groups. All students received the same 20 min lecture with projected digital 2D images. The printing groups also manipulated 3D printed models during the lecture. Both groups answered an objective survey (Multiple-choice questionnaire) twice, pre- and post-test, and completed a post-lecture subjective survey. Three hundred forty-seven students were included and both teaching groups for each CHD were comparable in age, sex and pre-test score. Overall, objective knowledge improved after the lecture and was higher in the printing group compared to the control group (16.3  2.6 vs 14.8  2.8 out of 20, p < 0.0001). Similar results were observed for each CHD (p = 0.0001 ASD group; p = 0.002 VSD group; p = 0.0005 CoA group; p = 0.003 ToF group).

Many guidelines on chronic liver diseases have been released to optimize the use of medical resources and patient management. However, most of these guidelines have been established through expert consensus because the existing data do not provide strong evidence for developing effective recommendations. As Wilson disease (WD) is a rare chronic liver disease, the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical status of patients with WD is unclear. The present study showed a marked shortage of medical resources for clinically managing patients with WD during the pandemic. Although patients with WD who consistently took anticopper therapy showed no significant differences in hepatic and extrahepatic markers before and after the pandemic, their complication incidences, especially the infection incidence, were significantly increased during the study period. Therefore, patients with WD should be encouraged to adhere to anticopper therapy and be closely monitored to prevent infections and other complications. The present study provides a clinical basis for further managing WD during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the clinical status of patients with Wilson disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases cause tremendous costs of both human and economy annually. Previously, we have studied the bacterial, fungal, and allergen aerosol inactivation by direct microwave irradiation. Here, we further investigated its effects on airborne viruses. MS2 coliphage used as a human model virus was aerosolized and exposed to the direct microwave irradiation for ~2 min at three different power levels (700, 385, and 119 W). In addition to the survival rate, the viral genes before and after the microwave treatments were also examined using PCR and gel electrophoresis. Direct exposure of airborne MS2 viruses to the microwave irradiation at 700 W for less than 2 min was shown to result in more than 90 % inactivation efficiency, about 65 % at medium power level (385 W), and 50 % at the lowest level (119 W). The aerosol inactivation rate followed a linear relationship with the microwave exposure time (R (2) = 0.9889). Scanning electron images revealed visible damages to the viral surface after the exposure. Damages were also observed to the viral RNA genes coding for coat proteins, among which the A protein gene was completely destroyed. This study demonstrated that even without the filtration the direct microwave irradiation could also achieve rapid inactivation of viral aerosols. The information obtained can provide useful guidance on the development of microwave-based viral threat mitigation solutions in a closed or semi-closed space.","output":"In situ airborne virus inactivation by microwave irradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a story about a Chinese herbalist Ing Doc Hay who combated the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the America West.

During the time of the pandemic running wild in the 1910s, he prescribed formulas aimed at flu and boiled herbal decoction, personally delivering it to a working site for those Chinese laborers as well as non-Chinese patients. None of the laborer patients treated by him died during this deadly pandemic. Due to his success and fame, his practice was booming even after the Chinese community disappeared in John Day in later years.

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on different population cohorts and which personality traits affected individual's coping responses can help identify strategies to promote self-directed behaviours, thereby enhancing and maintaining individual's mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: Using longitudinal data for the UK, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals mental well-being, focusing on age, gender, and personality traits as possible modifiers. METHODS: We explore the longitudinal nature of the data using individual fixed effects models, which implicitly control for unobserved time-invariant individual-level characteristics. Our sample is an unbalanced panel consisting of 373,555 person-years observations, observed from 2009 until June 2020. RESULTS: The negative impacts of the first months of the pandemic period are found to be larger for young adults (aged 16C25 years) and vary by personality traits. The increase in psychological distress symptoms is more pronounced for individuals who score higher in neuroticism, extroversion, and openness to experience. Indeed, for introverted young people, recent events may have actually brought a sense of calm. Other findings indicate that worsening in the psychological distress level occurs alongside with increased feelings of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the theoretical knowledge that different people have different psychological and behaviour responses and personality concepts can be used when studying individual's adaptive behaviour in critical situations such as COVID-19. Our results indicate the necessity of public health programmes to assist distressed young individuals.","output":"Personality, gender, and age resilience to the mental health effects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer vaccine development has proven challenging with the exception of some virally induced cancers for which prophylactic vaccines exist. Currently, there is only one FDA approved vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer and as such prostate cancer continues to present a significant unmet medical need. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a therapeutic cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX&#8482; adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) with the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Flt3L, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. We employed the TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) model of prostate cancer and the self-protein mPAP (prostatic acid phosphatase) as the tumor antigen. ISCOMATRIX&#8482;-mPAP-Poly I:C-Flt3L was delivered in a therapeutic prime-boost regime that was consistently able to achieve complete tumor regression in 60% of animals treated and these tumor-free animals were protected upon rechallenge. Investigations into the underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of this vaccine identified that both innate and adaptive responses are elicited and required. NK cells, CD4+ T cells and interferon-?3 were all found to be critical for tumor control while tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells became disabled by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. There is potential for broader application of this cancer vaccine, as we have been able to demonstrate effectiveness in two additional cancer models; melanoma (B16-OVA) and a model of B cell lymphoma (E-myc-GFP-OVA).","output":"Therapeutic ISCOMATRIX? adjuvant vaccine elicits effective anti-tumor immunity in the TRAMP-C1 mouse model of prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Both margin convergence rotator cuff repair (MC-RCR) and superior capsular reconstruction (SCR) result in improved clinical outcomes in the treatment of massive rotator cuff tears (RCTs). The question remains whether it is better to perform MC-RCR using native, albeit occasionally deficient, tissues or to perform primary SCR. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To compare the clinical results of MC-RCR versus SCR for the treatment of massive RCTs. It was hypothesized that SCR would yield better outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Included were patients who underwent arthroscopic MC-RCR or SCR for massive RCTs performed by a single surgeon between 2014 and 2019. MC-RCR was performed if it was technically possible to close the defect; otherwise, SCR was performed. Outcomes were assessed at 6 months and then annually using American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons; Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation; shortened version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand; 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary; and patient satisfaction scores. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) were compared between groups. Revision surgeries and complications were reported. RESULTS: Included were 46 patients in the MC-RCR group (mean age, 59  8 years) and 46 patients in the SCR group (mean age, 57  7 years); 29 patients in each group were available at 2-year follow-up. Preoperative outcome scores were not significantly different between groups. Within groups, all outcome scores improved from pre- to postoperatively (P < .05), with no significant differences in postoperative scores or patient satisfaction between groups. No significant between-group differences were noted in the percentage of patients who reached the MCID, SCB, and PASS (MCID, 92.3% vs 84.6%; SCB, 80.8% vs 80.8%; and PASS, 66.7% vs 66.7%). SCR had a significantly lower survivorship rate compared with MC-RCR (84.7% vs 100%) (P = .026). CONCLUSION: Both MC-RCR and SCR provided similar improvement in outcomes; however, SCR resulted in a significantly lower survivorship rate at 2 years postoperatively. If an RCT is technically repairable, we recommend that it be repaired primarily, even if MC techniques are needed to close the defect. SCR remains a good option for massive RCTs that are not technically repairable.","output":"Outcomes After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Using Margin Convergence Versus Superior Capsular Reconstruction: Should Candidates for Margin Convergence Be Treated With Superior Capsular Reconstruction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The German Spinal Cord Injury Survey is part of the International Spinal Cord Injury Survey, which aims to collect data about the life experience of persons with spinal cord injury worldwide. This paper reports on the perceived environmental barriers of the German study population and their associations with quality of life. DESIGN Cross-sectional explorative observational study using survey data. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,479 persons with spinal cord injury aged 18 years and older. METHODS After descriptive analyses, exploratory factor analysis was used to build groups of environmental barriers. Logistic regressions were performed to assess correlates of perceived environmental barriers. Spearman's correlations were used to analyse the association between perceived barriers and quality of life. RESULTS Barriers regarding infrastructure had a relatively large impact. Barriers in relation to people's attitudes towards spinal cord injury and the equipment of people with spinal cord injury had a relatively small impact on the lives of people with spinal cord injury. Several subpopulations showed a higher risk in experiencing barriers. Quality of life decreased with increasing experience of barriers. CONCLUSION The most life-hardening barriers were identified related to infrastructure, a category in which most barriers are modifiable, for example, buildings or transportation.","output":"Perceived environmental barriers for people with spinal cord injury in Germany and their influence on quality of life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Improving body image may help to enhance the quality of life of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Although evidence suggests psychosocial interventions can effectively improve body image in this population, no review to date has assessed their feasibility or acceptability. This manuscript reports the protocol for a review summarising current evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of psychosocial interventions for body image targeting women diagnosed with breast cancer and the study methods used to evaluate the interventions in question to provide recommendations to optimise the success and sustainability of psychosocial interventions for body image and future studies. Results will also help to identify gaps in the existing evidence to provide direction for future research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We searched the following databases for articles published in the English language from January 2000 to June 2021 using a systematic search strategy: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsychINFO and EMBASE. This search will be supplemented with a manual search of reference lists from relevant systematic reviews and included articles. Eligible studies will include peer-reviewed publications reporting on feasibility and acceptability in the evaluation of psychosocial interventions for body image targeting women diagnosed with breast cancer. All study designs are eligible, although articles are required to have reported on an intervention evaluation. Two reviewers will independently carry out study selection, extraction of quantitative and qualitative data and quality assessment. Data will be summarised in a narrative review and thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required because this is a protocol for a systematic review.

The main advantage of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIP) as the polymer for use with a molecular imprinting technique is that they have high selectivity and affinity for the target molecules used in the molding process. The components of a Molecularly Imprinted Polymer are template, functional monomer, cross-linker, solvent, and initiator. Many things determine the success of a Molecularly Imprinted Polymer, but the Molecularly Imprinted Polymer component and the interaction between template-monomers are the most critical factors. This review will discuss how to find the interaction between template and monomer in Molecularly Imprinted Polymer before polymerization and after polymerization and choose the suitable component for MIP development. Computer simulation, UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) are generally used to determine the type and strength of intermolecular interaction on pre-polymerization stage. In turn, Suspended State Saturation Transfer Difference High Resolution/Magic Angle Spinning (STD HR/MAS) NMR, Raman Spectroscopy, and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Fluorescence Spectroscopy are used to detect chemical interaction after polymerization. Hydrogen bonding is the type of interaction that is becoming a focus to find on all methods as this interaction strongly contributes to the affinity of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs).","output":"Factors Affecting Preparation of Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Methods on Finding Template-Monomer Interaction as the Key of Selective Properties of the Materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a number of photosynthetically produced small molecules that have previously been validated through SARS-CoV spike protein interaction assays for selectivity and effectivity in our database.
