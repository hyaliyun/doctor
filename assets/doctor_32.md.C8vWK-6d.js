We sought to analyze its global impact with a survey on colorectal cancer (CRC) care during the pandemic. METHODS: The impact of COVID-19 on preoperative assessment, elective surgery, and postoperative management of CRC patients was explored by a 35-item survey, which was distributed worldwide to members of surgical societies with an interest in CRC care. Respondents were divided into two comparator groups: 1) delay group: CRC care affected by the pandemic; 2) no delay group: unaltered CRC practice. RESULTS: A total of 1,051 respondents from 84 countries completed the survey. No substantial differences in demographics were found between the delay (745, 70.9%) and no delay (306, 29.1%) groups. Suspension of multidisciplinary team meetings, staff members quarantined or relocated to COVID-19 units, units fully dedicated to COVID-19 care, personal protective equipment not readily available were factors significantly associated to delays in endoscopy, radiology, surgery, histopathology and prolonged chemoradiation therapy-to-surgery intervals. In the delay group, 48.9% of respondents reported a change in the initial surgical plan and 26.3% reported a shift from elective to urgent operations. Recovery of CRC care was associated with the status of the outbreak. Practicing in COVID-free units, no change in operative slots and staff members not relocated to COVID-19 units were statistically associated with unaltered CRC care in the no delay group, while the geographical distribution was not. CONCLUSIONS: Global changes in diagnostic and therapeutic CRC practices were evident. Changes were associated with differences in health-care delivery systems, hospitals preparedness, resources availability, and local COVID-19 prevalence rather than geographical factors. Strategic planning is required to optimize CRC care.","output":"DElayed COloRectal Cancer Care during COVID-19 Pandemic: Global Perspective from an International Survey (DECOR-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To understand how policies developed by Local Government Authorities (LGAs) to address electronic gambling machine (EGM) harm are developed and implemented. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants from 15 LGAs in metropolitan Melbourne who worked in a role associated or aligned with gambling. An inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. RESULTS Three key themes emerged. First, participants described a shift from addiction frameworks to public health policy responses to EGMs, which was driven by increasing EGM losses and the harms caused by EGMs to communities. Second, there was the role of stakeholder groups in the policy-making process, including the challenges associated with engaging the community. Finally, there were barriers and facilitators to policy development and implementation. Barriers included a lack of financial resources and legislative boundaries imposed by the State Government. Facilitators included whole-of-LGA approaches, supportive councillors and collaborative efforts. Conclusions and implications for public health: LGAs have made shifts towards public health responses to EGM harm. Initiatives to further support policy development and implementation could include imposing a levy on EGM losses to directly support public health prevention activities and implementing robust state-based regulatory frameworks that support LGA responses to EGM harm.","output":"The development and implementation of electronic gambling machine policy: a qualitative study of local government policy makers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antenatal steroid (ANS) therapy is standard care for women at imminent risk of preterm labor. Despite extensive and long-standing use, 40-50% of babies exposed antenatally to steroids do not derive benefit; remaining undelivered 7d or more after ANS treatment is associated with a lack of treatment benefit, and increased risk of harms. We used a pregnant sheep model to evaluate the impact of continuous vs. pulsed ANS treatments on fetal lung maturation at an extended, eight-day treatment to delivery interval. Continuous low-dose ANS treatments for more than 72 hours in duration improved fetal lung maturation at eight days after treatment initiation. If fetal ANS exposure was interrupted, the beneficial ANS effect was lost. Truncated treatments, including that simulating the current clinical treatment regimen, did not improve lung function. Variable fetal lung maturation was correlated to the amount of saturated phosphatidylcholine present in the lung fluid. These data demonstrate that: i) the durability of ANS therapy may be enhanced by employing an extended, low-dose treatment regimen with reducing total dose; and ii) interrupting the continuity of fetal exposure by allowing it to fall below a minimal threshold was associated with comparably poor functional maturation of the preterm ovine lung.","output":"Continuous but not pulsed low-dose fetal betamethasone exposures extend the durability of antenatal steroid therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structural transformation can spur economic growth and development if it increases overall productivity growth.

The filter layer was produced using an electrospinning technique, since electrospun membranes present remarkable characteristics for air filtration. The electrospun membranes were functionalized with different nanoparticles (NPs), including silver (Ag), titanium dioxide (TiO2) and magnesium oxide (MgO), in order to include new properties, namely antibacterial effect. The developed membranes were characterized by FESEM, EDS, ATR-FTIR, GSDR and TGA, which confirmed the successful impregnation of NPs onto PCL membranes. The antibacterial effect and filtration efficiency were assessed, with the PCL/MgO NPs membrane presenting better results, showing inhibition zone diameters of 25.3 and 13.5 mm against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, and filtration efficiency of 99.4%. Three facemask prototypes were developed, and their filtration efficiency, air permeability and thermal comfort were evaluated.

When new disease epidemics appear such as SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), IAV (Influenza A virus), and in particular the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is especially timely to review the complexity of immune system responses to viral infections. Here we consider the controversial roles of effectors like IFN, discussing its actions in immunomodulation and immunotolerance. We explore the possibility that modulation of IFN could be used to influence the course of such infections. Importantly, not only could endogenous expression of IFN influence the outcome, there are existing IFN therapeutics that can readily be applied in the clinic. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlled by IFN suggests that the exact timing for application of IFN-based therapeutics could be crucial: it should be earlier to significantly reduce the viral load and thus decrease the overall severity of the disease.","output":"Between immunomodulation and immunotolerance: The role of IFN in SARS-CoV-2 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Subclinical inflammation has been associated with psychosis; however, it remains unknown whether this phenomenon appears also in the premorbid phase.

Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the levels of these markers may be different in high-risk converters versus non-converters. Two independent reviewers searched electronic databases until Dec 16th, 2020. After reviewing publication records, 16 studies (548 high-risk individuals and 559 controls) were included.

In addition to the treatment of COVID-19 patients, universities and other acute care hospitals had to provide emergency medical care, including for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The challenge was that no reliable planning figures were available regarding the expected volume for such a crisis situation and therefore no reliable resource planning was possible in this respect. Therefore, the aim of this work was to record the incidence of polytrauma and other injuries during the pandemic crisis in a university trauma surgery clinic and to compare it with the years 2017C2019. METHODS: In this single-center study, a retrospective analysis of the injury incidence during calendar weeks with existing exit restrictions (12thC19th week) for the year 2020 for trauma surgery patients of a university hospital was performed. At first, the treatment of COVID-19 patients was recorded daily in order to objectify the burden and expenditure of inpatient treatment for these patients. Then, for the evaluation period from 20.03.2020 to 06.05.2020, the numbers of 1. polytrauma, 2. work-related accidents and 3. leisure-related trauma patients were recorded and compared with the numbers from 2017C2019 during the same period. RESULTS: In total, 118 patients were treated with COVID-19 as inpatients during the period under study, of which up to 43 patients had to be treated simultaneously in intensive care on 1 day. Overall, the number of polytrauma, work-related accidents and leisure-time accident patients was lower in 2020 than in the previous years. Nevertheless, with a decline of only ?28% (22  4.9 vs. 16), a considerable number of polytrauma patients were recorded, while all work-related accidents (44%, 304  31.3 vs. 170) and also leisure-time accidents (39%, 173  22.7 vs. 106) considerably decreased. In the group of leisure-time accidents, there was initially a remarkable decline in the number of cases per week after the initial restrictions began, but as the duration of the restrictions increased, the number per week has risen to the level of previous years. DISCUSSION: Even in exceptional situations such as the corona pandemic, there were a significant number of patients in need of acute treatment, especially polytrauma patients. This should be considered in the future in the event of similar exceptional situations in the inpatient care framework when providing trauma surgery care capacities.","output":"Analyse des Trauma-Aufkommens in einer unfallchirurgischen Universit?tsklinik w?hrend der SARS-CoV?2-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a major complication leading to death after stroke. The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. METHODS: To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens characteristics and drug resistance. RESULTS: Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance ((2)(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively.

Nevertheless, there are limited data on its feasibility, safety, and physiologic effects. The objective of our study was to assess the tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: This historical cohort study was performed across four hospitals in Calgary, Canada. Included patients had suspected COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation, and underwent awake prone positioning. The duration, frequency, tolerability, and adverse events from prone positioning were recorded. Respiratory parameters were assessed before, during, and after prone positioning. The primary outcome was the tolerability and safety of prone positioning. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (n = 12 ICU, n = 5 hospital ward) were included between April and May 2020. The median (range) number of prone positioning days was 1 (1-7) and the median number of sessions was 2 (1-6) per day. The duration of prone positioning was 75 (30-480) min, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 91% (84-95) supine and 98% (92-100) prone. Limitations to prone position duration were pain/general discomfort (47%) and delirium (6%); 47% of patients had no limitations. Seven patients (41%) required intubation and two patients (12%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, prone positioning non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia was safe; however, many patients did not tolerate prolonged durations. Although patients had improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in the prone position, many still required intubation. Future studies are required to determine methods to improve the tolerability of awake prone positioning and whether there is an impact on clinical outcomes.","output":"Tolrabilit et scurit de la position ventrale veille chez des patients atteints de la COVID-19 et d'insuffisance respiratoire hypoxmique grave./ Tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral fluids offer a non-invasive sampling method for the detection of antibodies. Quantification of IgA and IgG antibodies in saliva allows studies of the mucosal and systemic immune response after natural infection or vaccination. We developed and validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect and quantify salivary IgA and IgG antibodies against the prefusion-stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Normalization against total antibody isotype was performed to account for specimen differences, such as collection time and sample volume. Saliva samples collected from 187 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases enrolled in 2 cohorts and 373 pre-pandemic saliva samples were tested. The sensitivity of both EIAs was high (IgA: 95.5%; IgG: 89.7%) without compromising specificity (IgA: 99%; IgG: 97%). No cross reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was observed. The limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA and IgG assays were 1.98 ng/mL and 0.30 ng/mL, respectively. Salivary IgA and IgG antibodies were detected earlier in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms than in severe cases. However, severe cases showed higher salivary antibody titers than those with a mild infection. Salivary IgA titers quickly decreased after 6 weeks in mild cases but remained detectable until at least week 10 in severe cases. Salivary IgG titers remained high for all patients, regardless of disease severity. In conclusion, EIAs for both IgA and IgG had high specificity and sensitivity for the confirmation of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections and evaluation of the IgA and IgG immune response.","output":"Development and validation of an enzyme immunoassay for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA and IgG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in endometrial glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) expression regulation by detecting the expression levels of endometrial inflammatory factors and GLUT-4 in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A total of 140 patients were included in this study and divided into four groups: the PCOS group, the obesity + PCOS group, the normal group, and the obesity group (n = 35 each). The general clinical data of all patients were collected, and their expression levels of TNF-, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-Bp65), and GLUT-4 in the endometrium were tested via immunohistochemistry. Endometrial stromal cells were cultured in vitro and treated with TNF- or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) + TNF-, and the expression levels of NF-Bp65, phospho-NF-Bp65 (p-NF-Bp65), and GLUT-4 were tested using Western blotting (WB) before and after treatment. As a result, we got: 1) Compared with the normal group, the abundance of the protein for TNF- and NF-Bp65 in the endometrium of the patients with PCOS was elevated, while the expression level of GLUT-4 was decreased; the difference was statistically different (P < 0.05). The comparison between the obesity + PCOS group and the PCOS group yielded the same results. 2) According to the WB results, compared with the normal group, the abundance of the protein for endometrial GLUT-4 was decreased in the PCOS group, and the expression levels of p-NF-Bp65 and NF-Bp65 were increased in the obesity + PCOS group; the differences were statistically different (P < 0.05). The addition of TNF- could decrease the abundance of the protein for GLUT-4 and increase the abundance of the protein for p-NF-Bp65. After treatment with PDTC + TNF-, the abundance of the protein for p-NF-Bp65 decreased and GLUT-4 increased compared with the TNF- group; these values were close to those of the control group. We concluded that the abundance of the proteins for local inflammatory factors in the endometrial cells of patients with PCOS was increased, indicating that TNF- could affect the expression of endometrial GLUT-4 in such patients by activating the p-NF-Bp65 signaling pathway.","output":"Effect of TNF-alpha on endometrial glucose transporter-4 expression in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome through nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To quantitatively synthesize the literature on the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

This response requires pDC-intrinsic MyD88-dependent signaling by Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9. Provided that they express appropriate recognition receptors such as Ly49H, NK cells can directly sense and kill MCMV-infected cells. The loss of any one of these responses increases susceptibility to infection. However, the relative importance of these antiviral immune responses and how they are related remain unclear. In humans, while IFN-I responses are essential, MyD88 is dispensable for antiviral immunity. Hence, a higher redundancy has been proposed in the mechanisms promoting protective immune responses against systemic infections by herpes viruses during natural infections in humans. It has been assumed, but not proven, that mice fail to mount protective MyD88-independent IFN-I responses. In humans, the mechanism that compensates MyD88 deficiency has not been elucidated. To address these issues, we compared resistance to MCMV infection and immune responses between mouse strains deficient for MyD88, the IFN-I receptor and/or Ly49H. We show that selective depletion of pDC or genetic deficiencies for MyD88 or TLR9 drastically decreased production of IFN-I, but not the protective antiviral responses. Moreover, MyD88, but not IFN-I receptor, deficiency could largely be compensated by Ly49H-mediated antiviral NK cell responses. Thus, contrary to the current dogma but consistent with the situation in humans, we conclude that, in mice, in our experimental settings, MyD88 is redundant for IFN-I responses and overall defense against a systemic herpes virus infection. Moreover, we identified direct NK cell sensing of infected cells as one mechanism able to compensate for MyD88 deficiency in mice. Similar mechanisms likely contribute to protect MyD88- or IRAK4-deficient patients from viral infections.","output":"Natural Killer Cell Sensing of Infected Cells Compensates for MyD88 Deficiency but Not IFN-I Activity in Resistance to Mouse Cytomegalovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the U.S. healthcare system due to the mismatch between healthcare system capacity and patient demand.

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and people's daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve. METHODS: We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on people's live and economics. CONCLUSIONS: While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model. These results provide helpful insights for policy-makers to dynamically deploy an appropriate intervention strategy to effectively battle against the COVID-19.","output":"Modeling of suppression and mitigation interventions in the COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Somalia has a significant place in the livestock sector in the Horn of Africa;livestock trade and export is one of the key economic contributors.

In the most compromised cases, COVID-19 infection leads to death due to severe respiratory complications. COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the primary cause of death in these patients. In the present study, we show an ultrastructural analysis on the lungs of a patient affected by COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lung specimens obtained at autopsy from a 63-years old patient affected by COVID-19 were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Slices of 300 mu m thickness were dehydrated and dried by Critical Point Drying in CO2. Slices were covered with a conductive gold film approximately 30 nm thick and observed at a Zeiss Sigma 300 SEM FEG in the secondary electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) modes. As case control a lung biopsy from a 60-year-old man was considered. RESULTS: At low power in all COVID-19 lung specimens severe changes in the pulmonary architecture were found, due to the collapse of air spaces. Moreover, alveolar cavities were covered by large membranes. At high power, alveolar membranes showed a fibrillar structure, suggestive of a loose network of fibrin. It has been also found that intra-alveolar red blood cells were frequently present in the alveolar spaces, surrounded by a reticular fibrin network, suggestive for fibrin-hemorrhagic alveolitis. Alveolar changes were constantly associated with pathological features related to the pulmonary vessels. Vascular changes were prominent, including endothelial damage and thrombosis of large pulmonary vessels. Fibrinous microthrombi were frequently detected in the inter-alveolar septal capillaries. In addition, it has been frequently detected capillary proliferation in the alveolar septa with finding suggestive for intussusceptive neo-angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our electron microscopy analysis showed that COVID-19-related lung disease is characterized by a substantial architectural distortion, with the interactions between alveolar and vascular changes. Intra-alveolar hyaline membranes are associated with macro-and micro-thrombotic angiopathy, ending with capillary proliferation. The new blood vessel formation originates from the septa and extends into the surrounding parenchyma.

We show that substantial susceptibility reductions are measurable in the metropolitan regions, which all continued in a phase of exponential growth of case numbers for a relatively longer time before public health interventions were introduced. Compared to these interventions, the reduction in metropolitan region susceptibility had a substantial role in the post-growth decline in infection rates.

Development of scoliosis in pediatric AFM patients has been anecdotally reported, but associated risk factors or incidence have yet to be determined. Methods: Pediatric AFM patients treated over a 10-year period at a tertiary care center were identified. Patients were considered to have scoliosis if there was radiographic evidence of coronal curvature 15 degrees. Number of limbs affected, independent ambulation and head control, ventilator requirement at initial admission, and long-term ventilatory support (1 year) were recorded. Muscle strength and functional status were assessed by manual muscle testing (MMT) and Physical Abilities and Mobility Scale (PAMS), respectively. Areas of spinal cord lesion on initial MRI were recorded. Bivariate analyses were performed, with alpha set to 0.05. Results: Fifty-six AFM patients (27 scoliosis, 29 no scoliosis) were identified. Mean time from AFM presentation to scoliosis diagnosis was 0.93 years. Mean major Cobb angle at first radiograph was 31.7  14.3 degrees. Lack of independent ambulation, ventilator dependence at time of admission or long term, number of limbs affected, and decreased MMT and PAMS scores were more common in patients who developed scoliosis (all, p < .05).

We evaluated EMS responses in an EMS region when it experienced low to moderate burden of COVID-19 disease to assess overall trends, response and management characteristics, and non-transport rates. Our goal is to inform current and future pandemic response in similar regions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prehospital EMS responses from 22 urban, suburban, and rural EMS agencies in Western Pennsylvania. To account for seasonal variation, we compared demographic, response, and management characteristics for the 2-month period of March 15 to May 15, 2020 with the corresponding 2-month periods in 2016-2019. We then tested for an association between study period (pandemic vs historical control) and incidence of non-transport in unadjusted and adjusted regression. Finally, we described the continuous trends in responses and non-transports that occurred during the year before and initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 103,607 EMS responses in the 2-month comparative periods of March 15 to May 15, 2016-2020, we found a 26.5% [95% CI 26.9%, 27.1%] decrease in responses in 2020 compared to the same months from the four prior years. There was a small increase in respiratory cases (0.6% [95%CI 0.1%, 1.1%]) and greater frequency of abnormal vital signs suggesting a sicker patient cohort. There was a relative increase (46.6%) in non-transports between periods. The pandemic period was independently associated with an increase in non-transport (adjusted OR 1.68; 95%CI 1.59, 1.78). Among 177,194 EMS responses occurring in the year before and during the early period of the pandemic, between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020, we identified a 31% decrease in responses and a 48% relative increase in non-transports for April 2020 compared to the previous year's monthly averages. CONCLUSION: Despite a low to moderate burden of infection during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found a decline in overall EMS response volumes and an increase in the rate of non-transports independent of patient demographics and other response characteristics.","output":"EMS responses and non-transports during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The repercussions of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) within the United States and across the globe are vast.

RESULTS: Out of 670 patients with COVID-19, 11 patients presented with post-COVID-19 SAT (6.8%). Those with painless SAT (PLSAT, n=5) presented earlier, had more severe thyrotoxic manifestations and exhibited higher C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and lower absolute lymphocyte count than those with painful SAT (PFSAT, n=6). There were significant correlations of total and free T4 and total and free T3 levels with serum IL-6 levels (p(all) <0.04). No differences were observed between patients with post-COVID SAT presenting during the first and second waves.

In 2020, a large fraction of the global population was impacted by restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, a period characterised by marked health risks and behavioural changes. Here we explore whether people responded to this stressor by spending more time in nature and investigate the reasons for any changes. We surveyed 1,002 people in Brisbane, Australia in 2020, to measure the change in use of green space during the restrictions period and benefits people associated with visiting them. About 36% of participants increased their urban green space use, but 26% reduced it, indicating a great deal of flux. Furthermore, 45% of the previous non-users of urban green space began using it for the first time during the restrictions period. Older people were less likely to increase their green space use and those with a backyard were more likely to increase their use of green spaces. Participants' change in use occurred regardless of the amount of green space available in close proximity to their households. In addition, we did not find a relationship between nature-relatedness and change in use. People's reasons for green space use shifted during the pandemic-related restrictions period, with many emphasising improvement of personal well-being rather than consolidating community capital. Most participants indicated an increase in the importance of the psychological and physical benefits obtained from urban green spaces. We conclude that increased urban green space use during moments of stress such as the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to ameliorate some of the negative effects of the stressor, but that the capacity and desire to spend more time in green space varies markedly across society. Sufficient urban green space provision for all sections of society will maximise the opportunity to employ a nature-based coping mechanism during times of personal or community stress. ? 2021 The Authors.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses known as coronaviruses, including the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respectively. These coronaviruses are associated in the way that they cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract illness. This study has used an unbiased analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus to understand the shared and unique transcriptional signatures of human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 relative to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. A major goal was to discover unique cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 among these three coronaviruses. Analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by the three datasets led to a set of 17 genes, suggesting the lower expression of genes related to acute inflammatory response (TNF, IL32, IL1A, CXCL1, and CXCL3) in SARS-CoV-2. This subdued transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 may cause prolonged viral replication, leading to severe lung damage. Downstream analysis of unique DEGs of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed changes in genes related to apoptosis (NRP1, FOXO1, TP53INP1, CSF2, and NLRP1), coagulation (F3, PROS1, ITGB3, and TFPI2), and vascular function (VAV3, TYMP, TCF4, and NR2F2), which may contribute to more systemic cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 than MERS and SARS.

In this study, we demonstrate the infectivity and genomic stability of SARSCoV- 2 by thermal inactivation at both 56C and 65C. The results substantiate that viable SARS-CoV-2 is readily inactivated when incubated at 56C for 30 min or at 65C for 10 min. qRT-PCR of specimens heat-inactivated at 56C for 30 min or 65C for 15 min revealed similar genomic RNA stability compared with non-heat inactivated specimens.

DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study employing a convenience sample of 224 staff nurses at two general hospitals in Riyadh province. METHODS The study utilized a two-part questionnaire that captures respondents' characteristics and the validated tool on Leading a Culture of Quality for Infection Prevention (LCQ-IP). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized accordingly. RESULTS The prioritization of quality received the highest mean score among the four factors of the scale (mean = 3.89, SD = 0.65), followed by supportive work environment (mean = 3.88, SD = 0.68), psychological safety (mean = 3.85, SD = 0.65), and improvement orientation (mean = 3.84, SD = 0.64). Nationality, clinical experience, and attendance to seminars or training were identified as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS The respondents perceived the infection prevention climate of the two general hospitals positively. This study strengthens the idea that organizational context influences negatively or positively the programs on infection prevention being implemented in the hospitals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The result may facilitate nursing and hospital management to reflect, examine, and review their organizational climate, the impact of infection prevention initiatives and patient safety strategies, and the reason to amend related policies or improve procedures, including the promotion of a healthy work environment.","output":"Perceived Infection Prevention Climate and Its Predictors Among Nurses in Saudi Arabia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurologic events have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE: Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS: Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events (a10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events (a26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS: The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies. CONCLUSIONS: Transconnectome diffusion of pathology via the structural network of the brain may contribute to the spread of neurologic events in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Modelling the Anatomic Distribution of Neurologic Events in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review of MRI Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic raises substantive ethical and legal challenges for inpatient psychiatric units striving simultaneously to contain COVID-19 and provide safe, high-quality psychiatric care.

We examine this complex dilemma by evaluating mental health law, quarantine law, public health ethics, a case from an urban academic medical center's inpatient unit, and literature focused on treatment and isolation protocols during HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

What is the optimal Pigovian subsidy for home delivery of food to internalize this externality? To address this question, we develop a model with three policy instruments: testing frequency, lockdown intensity, and a subsidy for home delivery of food. First, we consider the case where the testing frequency is adjusted so as to keep the pandemic's reproduction rate fixed. In this case, the value of the subsidy for home delivery is to allow for a reduction in the testing rate without affecting the reproduction number. This substitution is plausible when the testing rate is chosen optimally. Using illustrative calibrations for the US, we find in this case that the optimal ad valorem subsidy for home delivery of food is between 1.7% and 3.4%. However, it might be more likely that the testing rate continues to be chosen at a suboptimal level. In this case, reducing the reproduction rate of COVID-19 via subsidies for home delivery could cause a reduction in the expected lockdown intensity. Even if only 10% of the reduction in the reproduction rate is offset via reduced lockdown intensity, an ad valorem subsidy of between 5.4% and 10.8% will be warranted on these grounds alone.","output":"Optimal Subsidies for Home Delivery in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a preventable risk to the patient population and radiographer workforce.

Although a variety of computational methods have been proposed to repurpose drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is still a challenging task for new viruses, as there are no verified virus-drug associations (VDAs) between them and existing drugs. To efficiently solve the cold-start problem posed by new viruses, a novel constrained multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization (CMNMF) model is designed by jointly utilizing multiple sources of biological information. With the CMNMF model, the similarities of drugs and viruses can be preserved from their own perspectives when they are projected onto a unified latent feature space. Based on the CMNMF model, we propose a deep learning method, namely VDA-DLCMNMF, for repurposing drugs against new viruses. VDA-DLCMNMF first initializes the node representations of drugs and viruses with their corresponding latent feature vectors to avoid a random initialization and then applies graph convolutional network to optimize their representations. Given an arbitrary drug, its probability of being associated with a new virus is computed according to their representations. To evaluate the performance of VDA-DLCMNMF, we have conducted a series of experiments on three VDA datasets created for SARS-CoV-2. Experimental results demonstrate that the promising prediction accuracy of VDA-DLCMNMF. Moreover, incorporating the CMNMF model into deep learning gains new insight into the drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2, as the results of molecular docking experiments reveal that four antiviral drugs identified by VDA-DLCMNMF have the potential ability to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"A deep learning method for repurposing antiviral drugs against new viruses via multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization and its application to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since Hippocrates, the cornerstone of medical practice has been the doctor-patient relationship.

One reason may be that psychological resources are protective in stressful contexts. This study tested whether indeed psychological resources are protective against biological degradation for healthy mid-life women under the chronic stress of caring for a child with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (caregivers). METHODS: We tested whether five types of psychosocial resources (i.e., eudaimonic well-being, autonomy, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and mastery) were associated with biological indices of aging in a sample of mid-life women stratified by chronic stress; half were caregivers (n = 92) and half were mothers of neurotypical children (n = 91; controls). Selected stress and age related biological outcomes were insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), systemic inflammation (IL-6, CRP), and cellular aging (leukocyte telomere length). We tested whether each resource was associated with these biomarkers, and whether caregiving status and high parenting stress moderated that relationship. RESULTS: All the psychological resources except mastery were significantly negatively associated with insulin resistance, while none were related to systemic inflammation or telomere length. The relationships between eudaimonic well-being and HOMA-IR, and self-acceptance and HOMA-IR, were moderated by parental stress; lower resources were associated with higher insulin resistance, but only for women reporting high parental stress. The well-known predictors of age and BMI accounted for 46% of variance in insulin resistance, and psychological resources accounted for an additional 13% of variance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that higher eudaimonic well-being and greater self-acceptance may be protective for the metabolic health of mid-life women, and particularly in the context of high parenting stress. This has important implications given the rising rates of both parental stress and metabolic disease, and because psychological interventions can increase eudaimonic well-being and self-acceptance.

We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors that predicted whether a VAMC was in the top quartile of VA Video Connect (VVC) telehealth uptake for primary care and mental health care. Results: All 139 VAMCs increased their VVC uptake at least 2-fold early in the pandemic, with most increasing uptake between 5- and 10-fold. Pre-COVID-19, higher VVC uptake in primary care was weakly and positively associated with having more high-risk patients, negatively associated with having more long-distance patients, and positively associated with the prior fiscal year's VVC uptake. During COVID-19, the positive association with high-risk patients and the negative association with long-distance patients strengthened, while weaker broadband coverage was negatively associated with VVC uptake. For mental health care, having more long-distance patients was positively associated with higher VVC uptake pre-COVID-19, but this relationship reversed during COVID-19. Discussion: Despite the marked increase in VVC uptake early in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant VAMC-level variation indicates that VVC adoption was more difficult for some medical centers, particularly those with poorer broadband coverage and less prior VVC experience.

We note that the amount of pollution in the air, water, soil, and noise showed a significant decline during the pandemic. Global air quality improved due to lower anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants and atmospheric particles. Water ecosystems also demonstrated signs of recuperation in many countries. Less commercial fishing internationally resulted in the restoration of some aquatic life. Additionally, significant reduction of solid and water waste led to less soil pollution. Some places experienced cleaner beaches and ocean water while wildlife sightings in urban areas across the world occurred more often. Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown also led to a worldwide decline in noise pollution. However, the beneficial environmental effects will not be permanent as the world gradually returns to its pre-pandemic status quo.

Effective strategies for climate adaptation and development depend on understanding these differential sensitivities to climatic variability. This study focuses on a vulnerable population living in forest-fringe villages of central India, where seasonal migration is a common livelihood strategy for poor households to supplement their incomes with remittances. We quantify the relative sensitivity of a decision to migrate for the first time to climate and socio-economic variables and how the sensitivities vary for different segments of the population. We surveyed 5000 households in 500 forest-fringe villages to identify patterns of migration from 2013 to 2017. Using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, we predicted the probability of first-time migration of a household member based on climate variables and household- and district-level characteristics. We find that households in more agricultural and prosperous districts experience lower rates of migration but are more sensitive to climatic variability than households in poorer districts. The probability of first-time migration from a household in the most prosperous district increases by approximately 40% with one standard deviation in mean maximum temperature or rainfall from the 1981-2017 mean. However, the probability of migration does not vary as a function of climatic variability for households in the poorest district. We attribute this difference in sensitivities to the greater dependence on agriculture and irrigation in more prosperous districts and poverty-driven dependence on migration regardless of the climate in poorer districts. Households investing remittances from migration in agricultural intensification could become increasingly sensitive to climate variability, particularly with water shortages and projected increases in climate variability in the region. Promotion of non-agricultural livelihood options and climate-resilient agriculture could the reduce sensitivity of migration to climate variability in the study region.","output":"Sensitivity of seasonal migration to climatic variability in central India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, which has 79 5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential bat origin With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as \\"transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)\\" and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV","output":"The first Disease X is caused by a highly transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

Managing exposure risk requires understanding characteristics of aerosols created during procedures such as those performed using high-speed drills that operate at 200,000 revolutions per minute. METHODS A trained dentist performed drilling procedures on a manikin's incisors (teeth nos. 8 and 9) using a high-speed drill and high-volume evacuator. The authors used high-speed imaging to visualize the formation and transport of aerosol clouds and particle sampling to measure aerosol concentration and size distribution at several locations. The authors studied several aerosol mitigation strategies. RESULTS Aerosols produced during high-speed drilling were erratic and yielded high concentrations that were at least an order of magnitude above baseline. High-speed imaging showed aerosols initially travelled at 1 m per second. Owing to erratic behavior of aerosols, supplemental suction was not effective at collecting all aerosols; however, barriers were effective. CONCLUSIONS Barriers are the most effective mitigation strategy. Other methods studied have limitations and risks. To the authors' knowledge, this article presents the first characterization of aerosols generated during high-speed drilling by a dentist.

While many of these viruses cause severe and often fatal disease in humans, bats are able to coexist with these viruses without clinical signs of disease. The mechanism conferring this antiviral response is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the differential protein expression of immortalised Pteropus alecto kidney cells (PaKiT03) following transfection with the viral mimic, Poly I:C. Two complementary proteomic approaches, difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to quantify changes in protein expression following Poly I:C stimulation at 4, 8 and 20 hr post treatment (hpt). RESULTS: The expression of ISG54 gene, a known responder to virus infection and Poly I:C treatment, was significantly induced in transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Through iTRAQ analysis we show that Poly I:C up-regulates key glycolytic enzymes at 4 hpt within PaKiT03 cells. In contrast, at 20 hpt PaKiT03 cells down-regulated ribosomal subunit proteins. The analysis with DIGE of Poly I:C transfected PaKiT03 cells showed over 215 individual spots differentially regulated, however only 25 spots could be unambiguously identified by LC-MS/MS. Immunoblotting confirmed the up-regulation of Eno1 and Tpi1 in PaKiT03 cells following Poly I:C transfection. A comparison with human cells (HEK293T and HeLa) and one additional bat cell line (PaLuT02), demonstrated that glycolytic pathways are also induced in these cell types, but at different intensities. CONCLUSION: The two techniques, DIGE and iTRAQ identified largely overlapping sets of differentially expressed proteins, however DIGE unambiguously identified significantly less proteins than iTRAQ. Poly I:C induced a rapid metabolic shift towards glycolysis within the PaKiT03 cells at 4 hpt, presumably as a consequence of increased energy requirements. On the other hand ribosomal subunit proteins were seen as down-regulated by iTRAQ, these proteins may be the limiting factors in the translational machinery available for virus replication. This study provides new insight into the antiviral response of bat cells, highlighting the importance of energy metabolism.

Less attention has been paid to stigmatism, psychological well-being, hope, and religiosity, and how these may impact a patient's recovery. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to detect the difference in religiosity, hope, self-stigma, and psychological well-being (PWB) due to demographic variables (age, education level, social status, and level of income). Additionally, the research sought to test the mediation role of religiosity and hope in the relationship between self-stigma and psychological well-being among COVID-19 patients. METHOD A random sample of 426 COVID-19 patients answered an online questionnaire that contained four scales (Religiosity, Hope, stigma, and PWB). The data collected from the study participants were analyzed quantitatively by using One-way ANOVA, Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA, Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA, and Structural Equation Model (IBM SPSS statistics 21, and Amos v.25). RESULTS The current results showed statistically significant differences due to age in hope and well-being, in favor of the sample members belonging to the age group from 30 years old and over old, while there were no differences in religiosity and stigma due to age. There were no differences due to education level in religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Results showed statistically significant differences in well-being in favor of the married group, while there were no differences in religiosity, hope, and stigma due to social status. Regarding the effect of income level in the study variables, the results showed no differences due to religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Moreover, the findings found that both religiosity and hope play a mediating role.

The current mutagenesis and in silico protein design methods are confined by the limited throughput and high cost, while the high-throughput phage display and yeast display technologies are not suitable for screening glycosylated Fc variants. Here we developed a mammalian cell display-based Fc engineering platform. Methods: By using mammalian cell display and next generation sequencing, we screened millions of Fc variants for optimized affinity and specificity for FcRIIIa or FcRIIb. The identified Fc variants with improved binding to FcRIIIa were substituted into trastuzumab and rituximab and the effector function of antibodies were examined in the PBMC-based assay. On the other hand, the identified Fc variants with selectively enhanced FcRIIb binding were applied to CD40 agonist antibody and the activities of the antibodies were measured on different cell assays. The immunostimulatory activity of CD40 antibodies was also evaluated by OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell response model in FcR/CD40-humanized mice. Results: Using this approach, we screened millions of Fc variant and successfully identified several novel Fc variants with enhanced FcRIIIa or FcRIIb binding. These identified Fc variants displayed a dramatic increase in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in PBMC-based assay. Novel variants with selectively enhanced FcRIIb binding were also identified. CD40 agonist antibodies substituted with these Fc variants displayed activity more potent than the parental antibody in the in vitro and in vivo models. Conclusions: This approach increased the throughput of Fc variant screening from thousands to millions magnitude, enabled screening variants containing multiple mutations and could be integrated with glycoengineering technology, represents an ideal platform for Fc engineering.

Outbreaks of new pathogens are often ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.","output":"On the probability of strain invasion in endemic settings: Accounting for individual heterogeneity and control in multi-strain dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper summarizes the scientific discussion arguments related to government public communication in times of crisis by utilizing information and communication technology called social media.

Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced intraosseous blood flow to bones in the joints, which will rapidly induce joint destruction. Approximately one-third patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who received high cumulative doses and long treatment durations of glucocorticoids occurred osteonecrosis. Considering the similarity of SARS and COVID-19 on their pathogen, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic strategies, it is particularly desirable to investigate whether osteonecrosis will become a common sequela among convalescent COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This multi-strategy study was designed by integrating different research methods, such as meta-analysis, systematic review, and cross-sectional investigations to address above study objectives. At first, two meta-analyses were performed on the osteonecrosis incidence among SARS patients and the clinical data of glucocorticoid exposure among COVID-19 patients. Then, a systematic review of low-dosage glucocorticoid associated osteonecrosis and a cross-sectional investigation of glucocorticoid exposure of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan city of China were also conducted. Moreover, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options for osteonecrosis patients with COVID-19 infection were further presented and discussed. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis showed that 32% of SARS patients had developed osteonecrosis after receiving glucocorticoid treatment with high dose, and our system review supported that low level glucocorticoid exposure might also lead to the occurrence of osteonecrosis. Similarly, 40% of COVID-19 patients had undergone glucocorticoid treatment according to our meta-analysis. The cross-sectional investigation in Wuhan city of China found that the average of cumulative glucocorticoid exposure level was 504 ?mg calculated by the dosage of methylprednisolone. Notably, a confirmed osteonecrosis case was identified from 1406 patients with COVID-19 during our cross-sectional investigation, implying that preventive management of osteonecrosis should be better started with regular clinical follow-up observation. CONCLUSION: Growing evidence of the glucocorticoid therapy for COVID-19 patients prompts us to establish risk-classification-based early screening and to introduce early prevention protocol of its associated osteonecrosis that will be of clinical significance in favor of improved prognosis of this disease. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: To establish risk-classification-based early screening and to introduce early prevention protocol of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis will be of clinical significance in favor of improved prognosis of COVID-19.","output":"General recommendation for assessment and management on the risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) should aim for achieving a very high proportion of cure of all tuberculosis (TB) cases. Ineffective chemotherapy of TB that keeps a substantial proportion of patients alive without cure may amplify resistance during treatment and promote transmission of TB. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that in patients who require TB retreatment, the retreatment regimen that comprised 8 months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol supplemented by streptomycin for the initial 2 months, and pyrazinamide for the initial 3 months (2SHRZE/HRZE/5HRE) should no longer be prescribed and drug susceptibility testing (DST) should be conducted to inform the choice of treatment regimen. While GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay may detect rifampicin resistance, it does not detect isoniazid resistance. A 6-month regimen consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol may be used for the treatment of previously treated cases in whom rifampicin resistance has been excluded but DST of isoniazid is not available. WHO recommended to treat isoniazid-resistant, rifampicin-susceptible TB (Hr-TB) with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and levofloxacin for a duration of 6 months. In several low- and middle-income countries, the majority of Hr-TB cases are detected after the initiation of treatment with first-line regimens. If patients have an unsatisfactory response to first-line treatment with persistent positive sputum, modification of regimens needs to be done very carefully. Adding a fluoroquinolone in cases with undetected rifampicin resistance runs the risk of acquired fluoroquinolone resistance. Recently, WHO advises NTPs to phase out the injectable-containing short regimen for multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR-/RR-TB) and recommends that the preferred treatment option is a shorter, all-oral, bedaquiline-containing regimen. WHO emphasizes that access to rapid DST, especially for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance, is required before starting the bedaquiline-containing shorter regimen. The problem is that access to rapid DST for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance is limited in low- and middle-income countries. The use of WHO-recommended bedaquiline-containing regimens in the treatment of MDR-/RR-TB patients with undetected resistance to fluoroquinolones runs a high risk of acquired bedaquiline resistance, especially in settings with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. It is crucial to mitigate the risks of both primary and acquired resistance of rifampicin, fluoroquinolone and bedaquiline by rational design of regimens and effective management of TB patients.","output":"Principles of chemotherapy for tuberculosis in national tuberculosis programmes of low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearing a mask by the general public has been a controversial issue from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as the public authorities have had mixed messages, either advising people not to wear masks if uninfected, to wear as a protective measure, to wear them only when inside a building/room with insufficient air flow or to wear them in all the public places. To date, the governments have had different policies regarding mask-wearing by the general public depending on the COVID-19 pandemic evolution. In this context, the paper analyzes the general publics opinion regarding mask-wearing for the one-year period starting from 9 January 2020, when the first tweet regarding mask-wearing in the COVID-19 context has been posted. Classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been considered in analyzing the 8,795,633 tweets extracted. A random sample of 29,613 tweets has been extracted and annotated. The tweets containing news and information related to mask-wearing have been included in the neutral category, while the ones containing peoples opinions (for or against) have been marked using a symmetrical approach into in favor and against categories. Based on the analysis, it has been determined that most of the mask tweets are in the area of in favor or neutral, while a smaller percentage of tweets and retweets are in the against category. The evolution of the opinions expressed through tweets can be further monitored for extracting the public perspective on mask-wearing in times of COVID-19.","output":"Unmasking Peoples Opinions behind Mask-Wearing during COVID-19 PandemicA Twitter Stance Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One year into the Covid\\\\19 vaccination campaign, C.

The objective of this study is to determine the annual number of influenza infections acquired by HCP as a result of occupational exposures to influenza patients in hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. A risk analysis approach was taken. A compartmental model was used to estimate the influenza dose received in a single exposure, and a dose-response function applied to calculate the probability of infection. A three-step algorithm tabulated the total number of influenza infections based on: the total number of occupational exposures (tabulated in previous work), the total number of HCP with occupational exposures, and the probability of infection in an occupational exposure. Estimated influenza infections were highly dependent upon the dose-response function. Given current compliance with infection control precautions, we estimated 151,300 and 34,150 influenza infections annually with two dose-response functions (annual incidence proportions of 9.3% and 2.1%, respectively). Greater reductions in infectious were achieved by full compliance with vaccination and IC precautions than with patient isolation. The burden of occupationally-acquired influenza among HCP in hospitals and EDs in the United States is not trivial, and can be reduced through improved compliance with vaccination and preventive measures, including engineering and administrative controls.","output":"Annual Burden of Occupationally-Acquired Influenza Infections in Hospitals and Emergency Departments in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Facial nerve palsy leaves people unable to move muscles on the affected side of their face. Challenges exist in patients accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to strengthen muscle and improve nerve function. Access to therapy could potentially be improved through the use of digital technology. However, there is limited research available on patients and clinicians views about the potential benefits of such telerehabilitation based on their lived experiences of treatment pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather information about facial palsy treatment pathways in the United Kingdom, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of emerging wearable digital technology. METHODS: Separate surveys of patients with facial palsy and facial therapy specialists were conducted. Questionnaires explored treatment pathways and views on telerehabilitation, were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-up survey of national specialists investigated methods used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted allowing for data distribution. Open-text responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients with facial palsy and 25 specialist therapists completed the national surveys. Significant variations were observed in individual treatment pathways. Patients reported an average of 3.27 (SD 1.60) different treatments provided by various specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews were rare. For patients diagnosed most recently, there was evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy. Barriers to NMR referral included difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR among general practitioners. Patients traveled long distances to reach an NMR specialist center; 9% (8/93) of adults reported traveling 115 miles. The thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both patients and clinicians. The follow-up survey of 28 specialists uncovered variations in the measures currently used to monitor recovery and no agreed definitions of a clinically significant change for any of these. The main barriers to NMR adherence identified by patients and therapists could all be addressed by using suitable real-time digital technology. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide valuable information on facial palsy treatment pathways and views on the future introduction of digital technology. Possible ways in which emerging sensor-based digital technology can improve rehabilitation and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organizational barriers to this introduction of digital technology to assist NMR delivery, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.","output":"Raising the Digital Profile of Facial Palsy: National Surveys of Patients and Clinicians Experiences of Changing UK Treatment Pathways and Views on the Future Role of Digital Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe infection involving the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that subsequently requires patients to be intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients. With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff. As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions. In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient.

However, outcomes are varied and can be difficult to predict. Early prediction of suboptimal weight loss following LAGB may enable adjustments to postoperative care and consequently improve surgical outcomes. Therefore, our aim is to investigate the prognostic utility of using early weight loss following LAGB to predict long-term weight outcomes. METHODS Clinical data from patients undergoing LAGB between 2001 and 2007 at a single institution were retrospectively collected and analysed. The data was used to inform a model for predicting long-term weight loss after LAGB surgery. Percent total weight loss (%TWL) greater than 20% 1 year after surgery was considered a measurement of success since it has been associated with the improvement of comorbidities and increased patient satisfaction. RESULTS The average %TWL 1 year after LAGB surgery was 23.73% (n = 1524, SD = 8.68%). Weight loss of less than 10% in 1 year was a negative predictor of weight loss >20% in 8-12 years (OR = 0.449; p = 0.002; 95% CI = 0.272-0.742). Moreover, weight loss >20% in 1 year was a strong predictor of weight loss >20% in 8-12 years (OR = 5.33; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 3.17-8.97). CONCLUSION Total body weight reduction of less than 10% 1 year after LAGB surgery suggests a lesser weight loss at 8-12 years. For these patients, targeted interventions would be appropriate to increase the chances of long-term success.","output":"First-year weight loss following gastric band surgery predicts long-term outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orthohantaviruses are re-emerging rodent-borne pathogens distributed all over the world. Here, we report the isolation of a Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) strain from bank voles caught in a highly endemic region around the city Osnabrck, north-west Germany. Coding and non-coding sequences of all three segments (S, M, and L) were determined from original lung tissue, after isolation and after additional passaging in VeroE6 cells and a bank vole-derived kidney cell line. Different single amino acid substitutions were observed in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of the two stable PUUV isolates. The PUUV strain from VeroE6 cells showed a lower titer when propagated on bank vole cells compared to VeroE6 cells. Additionally, glycoprotein precursor (GPC)-derived virus-like particles of a German PUUV sequence allowed the generation of monoclonal antibodies that allowed the reliable detection of the isolated PUUV strain in the immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, this is the first isolation of a PUUV strain from Central Europe and the generation of glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies for this PUUV isolate. The obtained virus isolate and GPC-specific antibodies are instrumental tools for future reservoir host studies.

A citrate gold nanoparticle is first coated with a virus lysate to form a gold nanoparticle pseudo pathogen. The gold nanoparticle pseudo virus is then mixed with a blood plasma or serum samples. If the blood sample is from a positive patient, the activated immune molecules in the blood such as antibodies, complement proteins and others will react with the nanoparticle pseudo virus, leading to nanoparticle aggregate formation. The nanoparticle aggregate formation is detected and measured using a particle sizing technique called dynamic light scattering. In this study, we applied this test for Zika virus infection detection. We tested blood plasma samples from 85 Zika positive patients, 40 Dengue positive patients, 10 Chikungunya positive patients, and 78 non-patient control samples collected from both endemic and non-endemic locations. The study shows that the new test has a higher sensitivity compared to some existing commercial tests in the market, while maintaining a similar specificity. Within 7 days from the symptom onset, the new test can detect 43% of the infected patients while a commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects only 26% of the infected patients. Within 14 days from the symptom onset, our new test detects 73% of the infected patients while the same commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects 53% of the infected patients. The test is extremely simple, easy to develop, with test results obtained within minutes.

One potential success indicator is the provision of antidepressant medication to those needing it. METHODS: Public data from two surveys (Health Survey for England, UK; Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) covered 19 European countries across EMHAP phases one (2011C2015) and two (2015C2018). People screening positive for depressive symptoms by self-report were included. The primary outcome was antidepressant use: using country-specific weighted regression models, we estimated temporal trends and subgroup disparities in antidepressant receipt, with secondary analysis by country-level measures including healthcare expenditure. FINDINGS: Across 37,250 participants, after controlling for age, sex, wealth, and physical disability, antidepressant use (amongst those screening positive) increased significantly in 14/19 countries, with the smallest increase being in Slovenia (adjusted OR[AOR] for trend=1.68[1.20C2.36]) and the highest increase being in Germany (AOR for trend=10.07[7.54C13.46]) and Austria (AOR for trend=10.07[7.32C13.74]). The overall proportion using antidepressants was positively associated with national health expenditure (coefficient=5.43[1.62C9.25]), but not with gross national income per capita or the number of psychiatrists, general practitioners, or psychiatric hospital beds. In 15/19 countries, antidepressants were used less by 65-year-olds than 50C64-year-olds, with the smallest differential reported in Luxembourg (AOR=0.70[0.49, 0.98]) and the highest in Germany (AOR=0.28[0.21, 0.37]); this disparity widened in 12/15 countries. Men used antidepressants less than women in 8/19 countries, across phases. In 13/19 countries, people with physical disability were more likely to receive antidepressants, with the smallest gap in Italy (AOR=1.42[1.12C1.80]) and the largest in Israel (AOR=2.34[1.46C3.74]); this disparity narrowed in 5/13 countries. Disparity by wealth was found in 8/19 countries, but its temporal trend varied.

While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology. The current study aimed to assess community people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh. Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh. Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs). We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV. Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats. Factor score analysis showed that respondents' gender (p = 0.01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0.03), and their occupation (p = 0.04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths. A regression analysis showed that farmers had 0.34 times the odds of having correct or positive knowledge of bat ecology and myths than businesspersons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.15-0.78, p = 0.01). Regarding the spreading of NiV via bats, people had a lower level of knowledge. In NOAs, age (p = 0.00), occupation (p = 0.00), and level of education (p = 0.00) were found to be factors contributing to the amount of knowledge regarding the transmission of NiV, whereas in NNOAs, the contributing factors were occupation (p = 0.00) and level of education (p = 0.01). Regression analysis revealed that respondents who were engaged in services (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.07-8.54, p = 0.04) and who had completed primary education (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.02-9.17, p < 0.05) were likely to have correct knowledge regarding the spreading of NiV. Based on the study results, we recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and conservation of bats so as to improve people's current knowledge and subsequent behavior regarding the role of bats in ecology and the spreading of NiV in Bangladesh.","output":"Understanding the Community Perceptions and Knowledge of Bats and Transmission of Nipah Virus in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary Sj?gren's syndrome (pSS) has multi-dimensional manifestations, including neutropenia and polyneuropathy.

METHODS: Secondary analysis from the PRoVENT-COVID study. The PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicenter, retrospective observational study done at 22 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The aim was to quantify the dynamics and determine the prognostic value of surrogate markers of wasted ventilation in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. RESULTS: A total of 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19-related ARDS were included in this study. Estimations of wasted ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by HarrisCBenedict and direct method) and ventilatory ratio were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The end-tidal-to-arterial PCO(2) ratio was lower in non-survivors than in survivors (p < 0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles of dead space fraction by HarrisCBenedict and by direct estimation, and with an increase in the VR. The same trend was observed with decreased levels in the tertiles for the end-tidal-to-arterial PCO(2) ratio. After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities and ventilation- and oxygenation-parameters, none of the dead space estimates measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant impairment of ventilation in the early course of COVID-19-related ARDS but quantification of this impairment does not add prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model.

The virus particularly targets the temporal lobe of the brain causing debilitating problems in memory, especially verbal memory. It is postulated that immunomodulation with the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, could improve outcomes by reducing brain swelling. However, there are concerns (so far not observed) that such immunosuppression might facilitate increased viral replication with resultant worsening of disease. A previous trail closed early because of slow recruitment. METHOD: DexEnceph is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, observer-blind trial to determine whether adults with HSV encephalitis who receive dexamethasone alongside standard antiviral treatment with aciclovir for have improved clinical outcomes compared with those who receive standard treatment alone. Overall, 90 patients with HSV encephalitis are being recruited from a target of 45 recruiting sites; patients are randomised 1:1 to the dexamethasone or control arms of the study. The primary outcome measured is verbal memory as assessed by the Weschler Memory Scale fourth edition Auditory Memory Index at 26 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are measured up to 72 weeks include additional neuropsychological, clinical and functional outcomes as well as comparison of neuroimaging findings. Patient safety monitoring occurs throughout and includes the detection of HSV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid 2 weeks after randomisation, which is indicative of ongoing viral replication. Innovative methods are being used to ensure recrutiment targets are met for this rare disease. DISCUSSION: DexEnceph aims to be the first completed randomised controlled trial of corticosteroid therapy in HSV encephalitis. The results will provide evidence for future practice in managing adults with the condition and has the potential to improve outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has ethical approval from the UK National Research Ethics Committee (Liverpool Central, REF: 15/NW/0545, 10 August 2015). Protocol V.2.1, July 2019.

As a center without dedicated space that performs all simulations in-situ, having a means to continue to support our educators and learners during physical distancing is essential to our longevity. Methods: Simulation Educators required consultation with our simulation experts on the format and workflow process. Two learner groups then participated in virtual simulations in May of 2020. Immediately following the simulation, learners anonymously took a survey that included a 5-point Likert scale to measure the overall effectiveness of the experience in achieving the learning objectives.Results: The two pilots ran successfully and resulted in overall scores of 4.52 (n=23) and 4.66 (n=6). Feedback from both the educators and learners is encouraging and that virtual simulations are an adequate surrogate with physical distancing.Conclusions: More research is needed to determine the transference of knowledge to the bedside, and effectiveness across additional learner groups.

However, the magnitude of the observed effect is uncorrelated with both the number of positives per 1,000 people and the population size. Our results suggest that the reporting delay occurs in prefectures above a specific size, but the magnitude of the delay differs among prefectures. We consider two possible explanations for this effect: 1) delays caused by the administrative system. 2) fewer tests are conducted on the previous day.

The context of the research is represented by the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economic field, especially at the labor market level. This difficult situation could generate a negative impact in the sphere of traditional jobs and economic sectors. The main challenge for sustainable development in this new global situation is represented by human sustainability. Related to human sustainability, we emphasized the role played by the labor market and employability in mantling an optimal function at the social and economic level. For measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economic sphere, we used a quantitative design based on descriptive and inferential statistics. The research variables are represented by unemployment rates in the EU-28, employability rates, educational levels, gender, economic growth, labor mobility, material deprivation, economic freedom, and human development indicators. Empirical findings present the situation of a deep economic crisis generated by economic degrowth and by high levels of unemployment rates in the EU-28. Moreover, we have observed several predictors of employability in the new pandemic context as: material deprivation by age (in the field of young people), employment rate by education (tertiary education), and economic freedom. Another important finding is related to the gender perspective. Statistical correlations estimate a positive linear correlation between gender (women) and low rates of employability in the EU-28. All these empirical results could prove valuable for scholars interested in the relations between employability and sustainability and for political decision makers involved in the effort of reducing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic within national and trans-national economic systems.","output":"Sustainability and Employability in the Time of COVID-19.

In addition to genetic predisposition, a second hit, which usually occurs postnatally, is required for development of overt leukemia in most ALL subtypes. An untrained, dysregulated immune response, possibly due to an abnormal response to infection, may be an important co-factor triggering the onset of leukemia. Furthermore, the involvement of natural killer (NK) cells and T helper (Th) cells in controlling the preleukemic cells has been discussed. Identifying the cell of origin of the preleukemia-initiating event might give additional insights into potential options for prevention.

Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19-related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P<.05).

Currently, several studies have documented the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of complications and mortality in obese patients with COVID-19 are of diverse nature. Inflammation plays a central role in obesity. Metabolic alterations seen in obese patients are related to an inflammatory response, and several studies report elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in obese patients. Also, deregulated expression of adipokines, such as leptin and resistin, increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 that contribute to increased vascular leukocyte adhesiveness and additional oxidative stress. Additionally, it is now recognized that the chronic impairment of systemic vascular endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including obesity, when intensified by the detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 over the endothelium, may explain their worse outcomes in COVID-19. In fact, vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to a unfavorable response of the endothelium to the infection by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic environment in obesity may also provide a link to the increased cardiovascular events in these patients.","output":"Obesity-Related Inflammation and Endothelial Dysfunction in COVID-19: Impact on Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure-based virtual screening is an important tool in early stage drug discovery that scores the interactions between a target protein and candidate ligands.

In addition to swelling after initiating ambulation by participating in an activity such as hiking, running, or walking, there are also several other causes of swollen hands; a positive fist sign has only been described in a limited number of conditions observed in individuals with hand swelling. A fist is created when there is clenching of the fingers and the fingertips are in direct contact with the palm of the hand with the thumb lying on top of the fingers between the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. A positive fist sign is demonstrated by the inability to clench the fingers tightly into a fist; indeed, it is a common--yet not frequently reported--manifestation observed in individuals with a swollen hand. In contrast, a negative fist sign occurs when the patient can form a fist of tightly clenched fingers. The author, a 62-year-old physician and long-distance runner since high school, developed recurrent episodes of POTASH beginning five years ago. He noticed asymptomatic, bilateral, and symmetric swelling of his dorsal and palmar hands--with a positive fist sign--beginning after approximately one hour of running; the degree of swelling was proportional to the duration of time he ran. His hand swelling would completely resolve spontaneously--and his fist sign would be negative--within two hours after he stopped running. Recommendations for hikers and walkers to potentially eliminate or limit the degree of POTASH have been suggested; for dog owners who walked their dog, POTASH was less likely to occur if they regularly walked the dog. Several etiologies for POTASH have been proposed; however, the definitive pathogenesis for hand swelling related to either hiking, running, or walking remains to be determined. Therefore, research to gain additional insight and possibly establish the cause of ambulatory-associated swollen hands is warranted.","output":"Post Ambulatory Swollen Hands (POTASH): An Autobiographical Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background WHO has established a Global Clinical Platform for the clinical characterisation of COVID-19 among hospitalised individuals. We assessed whether people living with HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 had increased odds of severe presentation and of in-hospital mortality compared with individuals who were HIV-negative and associated risk factors. Methods Between Jan 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, anonymised individual-level data from 338 566 patients in 38 countries were reported to WHO. Using the Platform pooled dataset, we performed descriptive statistics and regression analyses to compare outcomes in the two populations and identify risk factors. Findings Of 197 479 patients reporting HIV status, 16 955 (86%) were people living with HIV. 16 283 (96.0%) of the 16 955 people living with HIV were from Africa;10 603 (629%) were female and 6271 (371%) were male;the mean age was 455 years (SD 137);6339 (383%) were admitted to hospital with severe illness;and 3913 (243%) died in hospital. Of the 10 166 people living with HIV with known antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, 9302 (915%) were on ART. Compared with individuals without HIV, people living with HIV had 15% increased odds of severe presentation with COVID-19 (aOR 115, 95% CI 110C120) and were 38% more likely to die in hospital (aHR 138, 134C141). Among people living with HIV, male sex, age 45C75 years, and having chronic cardiac disease or hypertension increased the odds of severe COVID-19;male sex, age older than 18 years, having diabetes, hypertension, malignancy, tuberculosis, or chronic kidney disease increased the risk of in-hospital mortality. The use of ART or viral load suppression were associated with a reduced risk of poor outcomes;however, HIV infection remained a risk factor for severity and mortality regardless of ART and viral load suppression status. Interpretation In this sample of hospitalised people contributing data to the WHO Global Clinical Platform for COVID-19, HIV was an independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 at admission and in-hospital mortality.

Such rationales may be driven by a mistaken perception that choosing cluster randomization lessens the need for informed consent. We reviewed a random sample of published cluster randomized trials involving only individual-level health care interventions to determine (a) the prevalence of reporting a rationale for the choice of cluster randomization; (b) the types of explicit, or if absent, apparent rationales for the use of cluster randomization; (c) the prevalence of reporting patient informed consent for study interventions; and (d) the types of justifications provided for waivers of consent. We considered cluster randomized trials for evaluating exclusively the individual-level health care interventions to focus on clinical trials where individual randomization is only theoretically possible and where there is a general expectation of informed consent. METHODS A random sample of 40 cluster randomized trials were identified by implementing a validated electronic search filter in two electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE and Embase), with two reviewers independently extracting information from each trial. Inclusion criteria were the following: primary report of a cluster randomized trial, evaluating exclusively an individual-level health care intervention, published between 2007 and 2016, and conducted in Canada, the United States, European Union, Australia, or low- and middle-income country settings. RESULTS Twenty-five trials (62.5%, 95% confidence interval = 47.5%-77.5%) reported an explicit rationale for the use of cluster randomization. The most commonly reported rationales were those with logistical or administrative convenience (15 trials, 60%) and those that need to avoid contamination (13 trials, 52%); five trials (20%) were cited rationales related to the push for more pragmatic trials. Twenty-one trials (52.5%, 95% confidence interval = 37%-68%) reported written informed consent for the intervention, two (5%) reported verbal consent, and eight (20%) reported waivers of consent, while in nine trials (22.5%) consent was unclear or not mentioned. Reported justifications for waivers of consent included that study interventions were already used in clinical practice, patients were not randomized individually, and the need to facilitate the pragmatic nature of the trial. Only one trial reported an explicit and appropriate justification for waiver of consent based on minimum criteria in international research ethics guidelines, namely, infeasibility and minimal risk. CONCLUSION Rationales for adopting cluster over individual randomization and for adopting consent waivers are emerging, related to the need to facilitate pragmatic trials. Greater attention to clear reporting of study design rationales, informed consent procedures, as well as justification for waivers is needed to ensure that such trials meet appropriate ethical standards.","output":"Cluster over individual randomization: are study design choices appropriately justified?

Some children are selected for unattended level 2 home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) with telehealth support, and we sought to review this home service. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted from 2013 to 2020. All level 2 HSAT reports in children aged 5-18 years referred for suspected OSA were analyzed. American Academy of Sleep Medicine compliant portable PSG acquisition equipment with EEG was used. The primary outcome was the proportion of technically successful tests achieved, and of these the % with potential underestimation of diagnostic category. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality and parental acceptance by non-validated service-specific questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive & inferential statistics. 2 tests were used for categorical variables. RESULTS: There were 233 (139 male, 59.6%) patients studied between 2013 and 2020 (7 years). The mean age was 10.8 (SD 3.6) years. 67 patients (28.8%) had comorbidities. Technically successful studies were obtained in almost 90% (209/233) and failed studies occurred in just over 10% (24/233). One failed study still achieved a diagnosis. There was no significant difference between failed studies set up by HITH nurses compared with Sleep scientists (p=0.2). Overall, an accurate diagnosis was made in 80% (167/209) of patients, with potential for under-estimation in 20% (42/209). Six hours or more of sleep was obtained in 89.5%. Parental questionnaires revealed 89.3% perceived high-level care, 91% perceived increased convenience and 76% good/excellent telehealth support.

Longer-term data are needed to determine whether the results are sustained. METHODS VBLOC DM2 is a prospective, observational study of 28 subjects with T2DM and body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m(2) to assess mid-term safety and weight loss and improvements in glycemic parameters, and other cardiovascular risk factors with VBLOC therapy. Continuous outcome variables are reported using mixed models. RESULTS At 24 months, the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 22% (95% CI, 15 to 28, p < 0.0001) or 7.0% total body weight loss (95% CI, 5.0 to 9.0, p < 0.0001). Hemoglobin A1c decreased by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 1.0, p = 0.0026) on average from 7.8% at baseline. Fasting plasma glucose declined by 15 mg/dL (95% CI, 0 to 29, p = 0.0564) on average from 151 mg/dL at baseline. Among subjects who were hypertensive at baseline, systolic blood pressure declined 10 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 19, p = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure declined by 6 mmHg (95% CI, 0 to 12, p = 0.0423), and mean arterial pressure declined 7 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 13, p = 0.014). Waist circumference was significantly reduced by 7 cm (95% CI, 4 to 10, p < 0.0001) from a baseline of 120 cm.

The study aims to assess the main factors involved in the development of early hypoglycemia in term and late preterm infants, and the implication of different environmental circumstances. METHODS: A prospective cohort study in infants born between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation. Three capillary blood glucose determinations were performed during the eight first hours after birth. SAMPLE SIZE: 207, 59 neonates developed hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Prenatal risk factors include gestational diabetes with poor glycemic control, twin pregnancy and gestational age. The presence of meconium amniotic fluid and planned cesarean delivery are associated with a higher probability of hypoglycemia. After birth, skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, soft lightening, and normothermia are described as protective factors. The predictive model that combines the type of lightening, body temperature and the excess of bases level, correctly classifies 98% of the severe hypoglycemia cases, with a high Nagelkerke R2 value (0.645) and specificity of 99.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal environmental factors seem to be directly related to early hypoglycemia development, so it is essential to support the maternal-child union and breastfeeding. Our results allow better identification of neonates who are not subsidiary to performing blood glucose determinations because they have little risk of developing it.","output":"Prospective study on influence of perinatal factors on the development of early neonatal hypoglycemia in late preterm and term infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the literature indicates that patient delays in seeking medical support for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are associated with poor clinical outcomes, delays in the diagnosis itself remain poorly understood in these patients. This study aimed to determine the median time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis and to identify the potential predictors of this interval in Saudi Arabian MERS patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with confirmed MERS who were publicly reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty-seven symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection were included. The median time interval between symptom onset and confirmation of the MERS diagnosis was 4 days (interquartile range 2C7 days), ranging from 0 to 36 days. According to the negative binomial model, the unadjusted rate ratio (RR) of delays in the diagnosis was significantly higher in older patients (>65 years) (RR 1.42), non-healthcare workers (RR 1.74), patients with severe illness (RR 1.22), those with an unknown source of infection (RR 1.84), and those who had been in close contact with camels (RR 1.74). After accounting for confounders, the adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of delays in the diagnosis was independently associated with unknown source of infection (aRR 1.68) and close contact with camels (aRR 1.58). CONCLUSIONS: The time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was greater in older patients, non-healthcare workers, patients with severe illness, patients with an unknown source of infection, and patients who had been in close contact with camels.

OBJECTIVE: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. RESULTS: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in- and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001).

However, much less is known about germicidal effects of terrestrial solar UV light, confined exclusively to wavelengths in the UVA and UVB regions. Here, we have explored the sensitivity of the human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 to solar-simulated full spectrum ultraviolet light (sUV) delivered at environmentally relevant doses. First, HCoV-NL63 coronavirus inactivation by sUV-exposure was confirmed employing (i) viral plaque assays, (ii) RT-qPCR detection of viral genome replication, and (iii) infection-induced stress response gene expression array analysis. Next, a detailed dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus inactivation by sUV was elucidated, suggesting a half maximal suppression of viral infectivity at low sUV doses. Likewise, extended sUV exposure of SARS-CoV-2 blocked cellular infection as revealed by plaque assay and stress response gene expression array analysis. Moreover, comparative (HCoV-NL63 versus SARS-CoV-2) single gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that sUV exposure blocks coronavirus-induced redox, inflammatory, and proteotoxic stress responses. Based on our findings, we estimate that solar ground level full spectrum UV light impairs coronavirus infectivity at environmentally relevant doses. Given the urgency and global scale of the unfolding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, these prototype data suggest feasibility of solar UV-induced viral inactivation, an observation deserving further molecular exploration in more relevant exposure models.","output":"Solar simulated ultraviolet radiation inactivates HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses at environmentally relevant doses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2009, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first noticed in the city of Wuhan in China, rapidly spreading to assume pandemic proportions within a short period of time.

In July 2020, 'remote-first' became long-term government policy. AIM: To explore how this change was portrayed in national newspapers and how depictions changed over time. DESIGN AND SETTING: Thematic analysis of newspaper articles referring to remote GP consultations from two time periods: 2 March-31 May 2020 (period 1) and 30 July-12 August 2020 (period 2). METHOD: Articles were identified through, and extracted from, LexisNexis Academic UK. A coding system of themes and narrative devices was developed and applied to the data. The analysis was developed iteratively, amending the coding structure as new data were added. RESULTS: Remote consulting was widely covered in newspapers. Articles in period 1 depicted it positively, equating digital change with progress and linking novel technological solutions with improved efficiency and safety (for example, infection control) in a service that was overdue for modernisation. Articles in period 2 questioned the persistence of a remote-first service now that the pandemic was waning, emphasising, for example, missed diagnoses, challenges to the therapeutic relationship, and digital inequalities. CONCLUSION: As the first wave of the pandemic came and went, media depictions of remote consulting evolved from an 'efficiency and safety' narrative to a 'risks, inequalities, and lack of choice' narrative. To restore public trust in general practice, public communication should emphasise the wide menu of consulting options now available to patients and measures being taken to assure safety and avoid inequity.","output":"Changing media depictions of remote consulting in COVID-19: analysis of UK newspapers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a major pathogen of commercial poultry flocks, circulates in the form of several serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino-acid changes in the S1 subunit of wild-type IBVS proteins may result in mutants unaffected by current vaccines. METHODS: Partial S1 gene sequences of 3 IBV isolates of the Moroccan Italy 02 genotype from vaccinated and unvaccinated broiler chicken flocks, located in southern and central regions of Morocco, were amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced, and aligned for phylogenetic and amino-acid similarity analyses. RESULTS: The three isolates were found genetically highly distant from known avian IBV based on partial sequences of their S1 genes: gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I01/2011(IBV/Morocco/01), gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I30/2010 (IBV/Morocco/30), and gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I38/2013 (IBV/Morocco/38), nucleotide sequence identities reached 89.5 % to 90.9 % among the three isolates. The deduced protein sequence identities ranged from 29.7 % (between IBV/Morocco/38 and Egypt SCU-14/2013-1) to 78.2 % (between IBV/Morocco/01 and Spain/05/866). Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated the emergence of a new Moroccan genotype, clustering with regionally related isolates from Spain (Spain/05/866) and belonging to a new sub-genotype. CONCLUSION: Our sequencing results demonstrate a co-circulation of wild-type infectious bronchitis viruses in broiler chickens. These results justify permanent monitoring of circulating strains in order to rationally modify vaccination strategies to make them appropriate to the evolving field situation.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of avian infectious bronchitis virus S1 glycoprotein regions reveals emergence of a new genotype in Moroccan broiler chicken flocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing through the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted sexuality and relationships, which may also change risk perceptions beyond traditional definitions (e.g. sexually transmitted infections).

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 placed nurses at the forefront of battling this pandemic in the intensive care unit (ICU). Emerging international evidence suggests nurses experience psychological and physical symptoms as a result of caring for these patients. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Using purposive sampling, 11 nurses from one ICU participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded and coded; data were analyzed using content analysis. An audit trail was maintained and member checking was employed. RESULTS: The experiences among critical care nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorized into five themes and subthemes. Emotions experienced was subcategorized into anxiety/stress, fear, helplessness, worry, and empathy. Physical symptoms was subcategorized into sleep disturbances, headaches, discomfort, exhaustion, and breathlessness. Care environment challenges was subcategorized into nurse as surrogate, inability to provide human comforting connection, patients dying, personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation, care delay, changing practice guidelines, and language barrier. Social effects was subcategorized into stigma, divergent healthcare hero perception, additional responsibilities, strained interactions with others, and isolation/loneliness. Short term coping strategies was subcategorized into co-worker support, family support, distractions, mind/body wellness, and spiritualty/faith.

The receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for infection. As ACE2 receptors are highly conserved within vertebrate species, SARS-CoV-2 can infect significant animal species as well as human populations. An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes isolated from human and significant animal species was conducted to compare and identify mutation and adaptation patterns across different animal species. The phylogenetic data revealed seven distinct phylogenetic clades with no significant relationship between the clades and geographical locations. A high rate of variation within SARS-CoV-2 mink isolates implies that mink populations were infected before human populations. Positions of most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes from the different hosts are mostly accumulated in the RBM region and highlight the pronounced accumulation of variants with mutations in the RBM region in comparison with other variants. These SNPs play a crucial role in viral transmission and pathogenicity and are keys in identifying other animal species as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The possible roles in the emergence of new viral strains and the possible implications of these changes, in compromising vaccine effectiveness, deserve urgent considerations.","output":"Comparative phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-possibility effect on virus spillover"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing research on individual preparedness in the United States indicates that we are generally unprepared for disasters.

OBJECTIVES: Here, an in silico approach was employed for deciphering the structure and immune function of the subunit of spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant. METHODS: The partial amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant S protein was analyzed, and its putative secondary and tertiary structure was predicted. Immunogenic analyses including B- and T-cell epitopes, interferon-gamma (IFN-) response, chemokine, and protective antigens for SARS-CoV 2 S proteins were predicted using appropriate tools. RESULTS: B.1.617.1 variant S protein sequence was found to be highly stable and amphipathic. ABCpred and CTLpred analyses led to the identification of two potential antigenic B cell and T cell epitopes with starting amino acid positions at 60 and 82 (for B cell epitopes) and 54 and 98 (for T cell epitopes) having prediction scores > 0.8.

We sampled and genetically characterized in detail a contact zone of two subtaxa of the rodent Mastomys natalensis in Tanzania. We find two distinct arenaviruses, Gairo and Morogoro virus, each spatially confined to a single M. natalensis subtaxon, only co-occurring at the contact zones centre. Inter-subtaxon hybridization at this centre and a continuum of quality habitat for M. natalensis show that both viruses have the ecological opportunity to spread into the other substaxons range, but do not, strongly suggesting host-intrinsic barriers.

Pelger-Hu?t anomaly (PHA) is a common abnormality of neutrophil nuclear morphology of unknown molecular etiology in myeloid neoplasms (MNs). We show that loss of nuclear lamin B1 (LMNB1) encoded on chromosome 5q, which is frequently deleted in MNs, induces defects in nuclear morphology and human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function associated with malignancy. LMNB1 deficiency alters genome organization inducing in vitro and in vivo expansion of HSCs, myeloid-biased differentiation with impaired lymphoid commitment, and genome instability due to defective DNA damage repair. Nuclear dysmorphology of neutrophils in patients with MNs is associated with 5q deletions spanning the LMNB1 locus, and lamin B1 loss is both necessary and sufficient to cause PHA in normal and 5q-deleted neutrophils. LMNB1 loss thus causes acquired PHA and links abnormal nuclear morphology with HSCs and progenitor cell fate determination via genome organization.","output":"Lamin B1 deletion in myeloid neoplasms causes nuclear anomaly and altered hematopoietic stem cell function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Online communication has taken over in the last 2 years due to the frequent lockdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overburdened physicians in this pandemic are struggling to get enough time to teach clinical skills online to the students. Also, due to students safety issues, the students cannot fully attend the clinics. Therefore, in this scenario, online PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) sessions for clinical skill teaching and learning can be an effective alternative for undergraduate medical students. The academic limitations caused by the COVID-19 related lockdown however can have a pleasurable outcome if certain challenges, related to online PAL, are overcome. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the challenges of Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) sessions during online clinical skills training in the Ophthalmology module of undergraduate medical students. METHODS: This qualitative exploratory study, utilizing online focus group discussions to explore the challenges of online PAL in training and learning of clinical skills were carried at the Ophthalmology department of Batterjee Medical College, Jeddah; Saudi Arabia. A purposive convenient sampling technique was used to collect data. Data were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study identified six themes that were further divided into smaller subthemes. The subthemes derived from the collected data were organized under the following major themes; infrastructure, learning environment, psychological problems, interaction deficit, learning desires, and desire for feedback on performance. The major challenge reported by the medical student during online PAL sessions was infrastructure in terms of network connection, scheduling, and timing of the session. The unprofessional learning environment, psychological problems in terms of behavioral issues and personality changes, interaction deficit with peers, tutor, and patient, learning desires, and desire for feedback on performance were the other important challenges faced by the students. CONCLUSION: The challenges explored by our study can be used by the medical educators to incorporate online PAL as an effective, efficient, and alternative teaching and learning modality in the curriculum especially in compromised circumstances like the current COVID-19 pandemic.

We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1.

Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing-termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. METHODS: A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Across most outcomes measured, telegenetics had equivalent outcomes to in-person appointment; however, the extent to which the available evidence is applicable to longer-term use is debatable.","output":"Videoconferencing to deliver genetics services: a systematic review of telegenetics in light of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is the world's largest publicly funded, multi-disciplinary international collaboration facilitating the development of vaccines to prevent HIV/AIDS and has conducted the vast majority of HIV/AIDS clinical trials since its inception in 1999.

The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Certain variants of ACE2 are known to be associated with COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular complications, diabetes, chronic lung disease, etc. In this study, we looked into the geographic distribution of disease-associated variants of ACE2 as well as closely located PIR gene to explore any possible correlation with the disparities in COVID-19 severities and casualties across ethnic groups. Frequencies of the ACE2 variants associated with COVID-19 comorbidities are higher in the European and the admixed American populations. These variants are also present with stronger pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the European and the admixed American populations. On the other hand, the variants with protective role are more prevalent in the East and the South Asian populations. Strong pairwise LD exists among the activity modifying (modifier) variants of the PIR and ACE2 genes only in the European super-population.

Consults to all divisions within general surgery were included. RESULTS: Total surgical consult volume decreased by 43% in the post-COVID-19 period, with a significant reduction in the median daily consult volume from 14 to 8 (P < .0001). Changes in consult volume by patient location, chief complaint, and surgical division were variable, in aggregate reflecting a disproportionate decrease among less acute surgical complaints.

Patients were classified regarding the technical approach used. Six hundred sixty-eight patients were available for the final analysis. Reperfusion rates ranged between 56% and 100% depending on the technical approach. The use of balloon guide catheters and most recently the establishment of combination techniques using balloon guide catheters, aspiration catheters and stent retrievers have shown a further significant increase in the rates of successful recanalization, full recanalization and first-pass recanalization. Additionally, the technical development of interventional techniques has led to a subsequent drop in complications, embolization into previously unaffected territories in particular.

Many online or digital mindfulness programs do not distinguish between live teaching and recorded or asynchronous sessions, yet differences in delivery mode (eg, face-to-face, online live, online self-guided, other) may explain outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use existing data from an online mindfulness solutions company to assess the relative contribution of live and recorded mindfulness training to lower perceived stress in employees. METHODS: Perceived stress and the amount of live and recorded online mindfulness training accessed by employees were assessed during eMindfuls One-Percent Challenge (OPC). The OPC is a 30-day program wherein participants are encouraged to spend 1% of their day (14 minutes) practicing mindfulness meditation on the platform. We used linear mixed-effects models to assess the relationship between stress reduction and usage of components of the eMindful platform (live teaching and recorded options) while controlling for potential reporting bias (completion) and sampling bias. RESULTS: A total of 8341 participants from 44 companies registered for the OPC, with 7757 (93.00%) completing stress assessments prior to the OPC and 2360 (28.29%) completing the postassessment. Approximately one-quarter of the participants (28.86%, 2407/8341) completed both assessments. Most of the completers (2161/2407, 89.78%) engaged in the platform at least once. Among all participants (N=8341), 8.78% (n=707) accessed only recorded sessions and 33.78% (n=2818) participated only in the live programs. Most participants engaged in both live and recorded options, with those who used any recordings (2686/8341, 32.20%) tending to use them 3-4 times. Controlling for completer status, any participation with the eMindful OPC reduced stress (B=C0.32, 95% CI C0.35 to C0.30, SE=0.01, t(2393.25)=C24.99, P<.001, Cohen d=C1.02). Participation in live programs drove the decrease in stress (B=C0.03, SE=0.01, t(3258.61)=C3.03, P=.002, d=C0.11), whereas participation in recorded classes alone did not. Regular practice across the month led to a greater reduction in stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in stark contrast to the rapid evolution of online mindfulness training for the workplace. While the market is reproducing apps and recorded teaching at an unprecedented pace, our results demonstrate that live mindfulness programs with recorded or on-demand programs used to supplement live practices confer the strongest likelihood of achieving a significant decrease in stress levels.","output":"The Relative Contributions of Live and Recorded Online Mindfulness Training Programs to Lower Stress in the Workplace: Longitudinal Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When vaccine supplies are anticipated to be limited, necessitating the vaccination of certain groups earlier than others, the assessment of values and preferences of stakeholders is an important component of an ethically sound vaccine prioritization framework.

METHODS: The priority-setting exercise included a survey of stakeholders that was conducted from July 22 to Aug. 14, 2020. Stakeholders included clinical and public health expert groups, provincial and territorial committees and national Indigenous groups, patient and community advocacy representatives and experts, health professional associations and federal government departments. Survey results were analyzed to identify trends. RESULTS: Of 155 stakeholders contacted, 76 surveys were received for a participation rate of 49%. During a period of anticipated initial vaccine scarcity for all pandemic scenarios, stakeholders generally considered the most important vaccination strategy to be protecting those who are most vulnerable to severe illness and death from COVID-19. This was followed in importance by strategies to protect health care capacity, minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and protect critical infrastructure.

METHODS: Eligible participants consented online and were mailed a participant-collection kit to support collection of three specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing: saliva, OPS, and DBS. Participants performed the specimen collection procedures during a telehealth video appointment while clinical observers watched and documented the suitability of the collection. The biological sufficiency of the specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and serology testing was assessed by laboratorians using visual inspection and quantification of the nucleic acid contents of the samples by ribonuclease P (RNase P) measurements.

Proteins are major chromophores and targets for damage due to their abundance, but the role of proteins in inducing damage to bound DNA, and the effects on DNA-protein interactions is less well characterized. In E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP/CAP) regulates more than 500 genes. In this study we show that exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP to UV modifies specific Met, Trp, Tyr, and Pro side-chains, induces inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links, and decreases DNA binding via oxidation of Met114/Pro110 residues in close proximity at the CRP dimer interface. UV exposure also modifies DNA-bound cAMP-CRP, with this resulting in DNA cleavage at specific G/C residues within the sequence bound to CRP, but not at other G/C sites. Oxidation also increases CRP dissociation from DNA. The modifications at the CRP dimer interface, and the site-specific DNA strand cleavage are proposed to occur via oxidation of two species Met residues (Met114 and Met189, respectively) to reactive persulfoxides that damage neighbouring amino acids and DNA bases.

The resulting method is fast, practical, and free from the identification problem. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closed-form alternatives and as small as the usual Poisson regressions. For counts with many zeros, our approximation has better estimation accuracy than conventional Poisson regression. We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects. The developed method was applied for analyzing COVID-19 data in Japan.

The risk of an increase in the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks, and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Sao Paulo. RESULTS: For a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact tracing strategy is performed.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: (1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; (2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; (3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; (4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; (5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery.

We described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, physical activity, mental health, alcohol use, patterns of social networking service use, and health information data sharing. Analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Multivariate models (multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and multinomial logistic model) were used to assess the sole and joint effect of sex and pandemic.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess immunogenicity, aPL production and safety of Sinovac-Coronavac in PAPS patients. Methods: This prospective controlled phase 4 study of SARS-CoV-2-na?ve PAPS patients and a control group (CG) consisted of a two-dose Sinovac-CoronaVac (D0/D28) and blood collection before vaccination (D0), at D28 and 6 weeks after second dose (D69) for immunogenicity/aPL levels. Outcomes were seroconversion (SC) rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAb) at D28/D69. Safety and aPL production were also assessed. Results: Forty-four PAPS patients and 132 CG had comparable age (p=0.982) and sex (p>0.999). At D69, both groups had high and comparable SC (83.9% vs. 93.5%, p=0.092) and GMT [50.2(95%CI 34.5-73.2) vs. 61.7 (95%CI 52.8-72.3), p=0.249] as well as NAb positivity (77.4% vs. 78.7%, p=0.440), and NAb-activity [64.3% (49.0-77.0) vs. 60.9% (45.6-81.3), p=0.689]. Of note, for D28, the antibody response was very low and also similar in both groups SC (25.8% vs. 30.6% p=0.609). Antiphospholipid levels remained stable throughout the study at D0 vs D28 vs D69 (IgG aCL, p=0.058;IgM aCL, p=0.091;IgG a2GPI, p=0.513 and IgM a2GPI, p=0.468).

It is tenable that the timing of such a gradual drop in the immunity of most of the vaccinated population would synchronize with the near-complete restoration of normalcy.

CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of stage IV pancreatic cancer in a patient with TSC2 and SMAD4 mutations treated with immunotherapy when the disease progressed after multi-line chemotherapy. Next generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the presence of TSC2 and SMAD4 mutations and microsatellite stability (MSS). When the disease progressed after chemotherapy, a combination strategy was devised consisting of chemotherapy (S-1) and sintilimab. The patient had a partial response to therapy with this regimen, the lesions were significantly reduced and nearly disappeared. In metastatic pancreatic cancer, responses of this magnitude are rarely seen.

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","output":"Evolutionary and structural analysis elucidates mutations on SARS-CoV2 spike protein with altered human ACE2 binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A key focus of the CIRP CAT 2020 is the role of standardization in GPS specification, and the constraints and opportunities provided by standards throughout the design lifecycle, including in the verification of products.

University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. METHODS: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Six negative predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students' psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students' psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. CONCLUSION: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students' psychological wellbeing.","output":"Identifying Predictors of University Students' Wellbeing during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Data-Driven Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhinoviruses, a genus of the family Picornaviridae, are the cause of more than 50% of respiratory tract infections.

We assumed that the epidemic crisis, social isolation, and restrictions in hospitals which affect pregnant and postpartum women - lack of family labors, lack of the possibility to be with the newborn when he/she is hospitalized, may increase fear and reduce psychosocial resources of women, hinder their normal process of transition to motherhood and thus contribute to the intensified severity of depressive symptoms. Methods: : The study participants were women seeking support at the on-line platform of the project Next Stop: Mum, which is a part of the postpartum depression preventions program implemented by the Ministry of Health in Poland, and enables remote self-screening for the severity of the postpartum depression symptoms with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale developed by Cox and collaborators. The analyzed data in this study were obtained from 139 women: 61 filled forms from October 1 - November 10, 2019 (non-epidemic period), and 78 filled forms from February 20 - March 30 (beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic), 2020. Results: : A statistically significant difference in the severity of postpartum depression symptoms were observed among women making a self-assessment with EPDS scale at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland (M = 15.71;SD = 6.23), compared to the pre-epidemic neutral period (M = 13.56;SD = 6.46). Conclusions: : The results of this study indicate that the epidemic crisis may be associated with an increased need for additional caution and support of women's mental health in the postpartum period.

When they become maladaptive or overly biased, pathological affective states such as depression can emerge. Despite the importance of moods for human experience, little is known about their causal neurobiological mechanisms. In humans, methodological and interpretational limitations prevent causal investigations into the origins of mood, highlighting the importance of animal models. Nonhuman primates that share key neuroanatomical, affective, and social features with humans will be essential to uncovering their foundation.

RESULTS 28 crias were < or = 31 days old, 11 were 32 to 62 days old, and 6 were 63 to 210 days old. Potential pathogens were isolated from feces from 32 of the 45 crias.

In an application from a COVID-19 setting, we utilize differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand. Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic differentiation.

There are four cpn60 sequence-based subgroups within the genus (A, B, C and D), and thirteen genome species have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth rate of subgroups A, B and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche overlap with the other more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative frequency-dependent selection. Using 40 whole-genome sequences from isolates representing all four subgroups, we found that they could be distinguished based on the content of their predicted proteomes. Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups. Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative frequency-dependent selection in the vaginal microbiome.

Therefore, in August 2020, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey on these topics in 913 participants in Germany. Participants completed a questionnaire on various synonyms and symptoms of corona virus and specified the importance they attributed to individual and regulatory measures. The virus was linked more closely with most synonyms and the discovery in China than with the places of the first larger European outbreaks. General (cold-like) symptoms, such as cough and fever, were more widely known than COVID-19-specific ones, e.g., loss of taste and smell. The widely promoted individual measures distancing, hygiene, and (facial) mask wearing were rated as highly important, as were the corresponding official measures, e.g., the distancing rule and mask mandate. However, the corona warning app and a vaccine mandate were rated as less important. A subgroup analysis showed broad agreement between the subgroups on nearly all issues.

METHODS: We collected data retrospectively from the electronic medical records of all patients receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 11th March and 10th May 2020 undergoing maintenance haemodialysis at four satellite dialysis units from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Mortality was the primary outcome, and the need for hospitalization was the secondary one. RESULTS: Out of 746 patients undergoing regular haemodialysis, 148 symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were included in the analysis. The overall mortality rate was 24.3%. By univariate analysis, older age, ischaemic heart disease, lower systolic blood pressure, lower body mass index (BMI) and higher frailty scores were associated with higher rates of mortality (all p value < 0.05). The laboratory factors associated with mortality were higher values of WBC, neutrophil counts, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin, ferritin, troponin, and lower serum albumin level (all p value < 0.05). In the logistic regression, mortality was associated with older age and higher CRP, while high levels of NLR and CRP were associated with the need for hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Haemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high mortality rate. Our study identifies prognostic risk factors associated with poor outcome including age, frailty and markers of inflammation, which may support more informed clinical decision-making.

The recent implication of a novel beta ()-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population. In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs. Nine were alpha ()-CoVs; four were -CoVs. Twelve were novel. Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs. A -CoV with 96.5 % amino acid identity to the -CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.

Herein we evaluated the interest in measuring the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a biomarker of intestinal injury, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Serum I-FABP was analyzed in 28 consecutive patients hospitalized for a PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in 24 hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases, and 79 patients admitted to the emergency room for abdominal pain. RESULTS: I-FABP serum concentrations were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19, as compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases [70.3 pg/mL (47C167.9) vs. 161.1 pg/mL (88.98C305.2), respectively, p = 0.008].

There is evidence that some communities are disproportionately affected. This may result in geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risk that, if identified, could guide control efforts. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level geographic disparities and identify predictors of COVID-19 hospitalization risk in the St. Louis area. MethodsHospitalization data for COVID-19 and several chronic diseases were obtained from the Missouri Hospital Association. ZCTA-level data on socioeconomic and demographic factors were obtained from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey. Age-adjusted COVID-19 and several chronic disease hospitalization risks were calculated. Geographic disparities in distribution of COVID-19 age-adjusted hospitalization risk, socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as chronic disease risks were investigated using choropleth maps. Predictors of ZCTA-level COVID-19 hospitalization risks were investigated using global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models. ResultsThere were geographic disparities of COVID-19 hospitalization risks. COVID-19 hospitalization risks were significantly higher in ZCTAs with high diabetes hospitalization risks (p<0.0001), high risks of COVID-19 cases (p<0.0001), as well as high percentages of black population (p=0.0416) and populations with some college education (p=0.0005). The coefficients of the first three predictors varied across ZCTAs, implying that the associations between COVID-19 hospitalization risks and these predictors varied by geographic location. This implies that a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" approach may not be appropriate for management and control. ConclusionsThere is evidence of geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risks that are driven by differences in socioeconomic, demographic and health-related factors. The impacts of these factors vary by geographical location with some factors being more important predictors in some locales than others. Use of both global and local models leads to a better understanding of the determinants of geographic disparities in health outcomes and utilization of health services. These findings are useful for informing health planning to identify geographic areas likely to have high numbers of individuals needing hospitalization as well as guiding vaccination efforts.","output":"Geographic Disparities and Predictors of COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk in the St. Louis Area, Missouri (USA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the results of a preliminary survey in a central urban area of Rome, Italy.

We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.10.6 (MeanSE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests.

Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a Minimum Health Standards policy, MHS) to represent the first wave of the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and interventions. FINDINGS: Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at ~8%, population recovered at ~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, mobility, and MHS adherence. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new variants of concern.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, and due to the high morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic many Governments have introduced social restrictions.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter, retrospective review of patients undergoing open ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated/contaminated fields using biologic or synthetic mesh. Patient and hernia details were characterized. Primary outcomes included 90-day surgical site event, surgical site infection, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS A total of 126 patients undergoing major ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated/contaminated fields (69 biologic and 57 synthetic meshes) were analyzed. Groups were similar in both patient and hernia characteristics. There were 13 (22.8%) surgical site events in the synthetic cohort compared to 29 (42.0%) in the biologic cohort, P = .024. Similarly, surgical site infections were less frequent in the synthetic group, with 7 (12.3%) vs 22 (31.9%), P = .01.

CONCLUSION The choice of mesh for clean-contaminated/contaminated ventral hernia repair remains debatable. We demonstrated that using synthetic sublay mesh resulted in a significantly lower wound morbidity and more durable outcomes versus a similar cohort of biologic repairs. This is likely secondary to improved bacterial clearance and faster integration of macroporous synthetics.

inhabitants) and several other areas affecting over 60 million of people Since February 18, China has reported the number of recovered cases is vastly outpacing the number of new confirmed cases each day  (Roper 2020) In the meantime, the coronavirus has crossed the borders of China, and Western countries have been much slower in their response On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world and the sustained risk of further global spread (Ducharme 2020) and on 13 March, [i] nternational health officials said Friday that Europe has become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, as the continent is now producing more new cases each day than China did at the height of its crisis (Coote and Jacobson 2020) In popular media, the Covid-19 pandemic has started an infodemic of unprecedented scale;fake news and bullshit flourish alongside credible information from sources such as the World Health Organization In the context of research, the Covid-19 pandemic has initiated historically unprecedented levels of collaboration and openness, prompting some authors to suggest that [w] hen the story of the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) is finally written, it might well become a template for the utopian dream of open science  where research data is shared freely, unrestrained by competition, paywalls and patents (Crowe 2020) Worldwide closures of schools and universities have pushed millions of students and teachers online, bringing decades of experience in the field under the public eye (Bates 2020) Commentators compare Chinese and Western responses to the crisis, often under bombastic titles such as Coronavirus and the Clash of Civilizations (Maes 2020) Political scientists discuss whether the pandemic is an argument for total dismissal of capitalism or just a passing aberration in its functioning (Roberts 2020) Economists advise us to prepare the new recession (Elliott 2020) Sociologists see worldwide border closures as an anti-globalization experiment (Peters et al 2020), and philosophers go back to questions pertaining to human nature Worldwide governments are responding in radically different waysthe government of Montenegro has closed down the whole country before it registered the first patient within its borders (World Health Organization 2020b), while the UK has opted for a laissez faire approach which is hoped to result in herd immunity (Dunn and Kahn 2020) From official news to social networks,

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing are needed for detection of current or past infections. A wide range of commercial tests is available. However, most of them need to be validated. STUDY DESIGN: The aim was to compare a commercial IgG and IgA ELISA (Euroimmun) with three lateral flow immunoassays (LFI): Hangzhou Alltest Biotech, Wuhan UNscience Biotechnology and Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Specificity was calculated with 62 available serum samples from 2018/19. The study included 152 sera from patients of which 109 were RT-PCR positive. Sensitivities for ELISA anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were 81.5 % and 93.1 % and specificities 100 % and 80.6 %, respectively. LFI showed variable performances, overall results being better for Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial serological tests are useful for detection of antibodies in patients with COVID-19. ELISA presented better results than LFI.

This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement. Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization. Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14  14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Is there any effect of smoking status on severity and mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1186/s40560-020-00445-4.].","output":"Correction to: Nationwide system to centralize decisions around ECMO use for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Japan (Special Correspondence)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PHENOMENON With increasing mobility of people across borders and medical tourism, more countries are called to make their healthcare environment ready to accept foreign patients. Patient communication skills in English are indispensable for healthcare professionals in non-English-speaking countries. This is not only in caring for foreign patients within the country but also contributing to the global health by practicing outside of the country. Although Japanese-speaking simulated patients have been involved in medical education in Japan since the 1970s and with Objective Structured Clinical Examinations formally implemented in 2005, very few medical schools have been working with English-speaking simulated patients (ESSPs). APPROACH A nationwide survey was conducted to investigate the involvement of ESSPs at medical schools in Japan. A questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was mailed to the deans of 80 medical schools to determine the current ESSP involvement and the problems educators were facing in regard to working with or not working with ESSPs. The survey was conducted from November 2015 through March 2016. Data were analyzed to find problems regarding ESSPs so that their involvement could be enhanced toward developing medical students' patient communication skills. FINDINGS Responses from 60 medical schools (75% response rate) were received and analyzed. Among them, 22 schools were working with ESSPs, and 23 schools were willing to introduce them into their programs. The background of ESSPs varied with international students or faculty often filling the role. Many ESSPs received less than two hours of training. ESSP programs were required in the preclinical years, and more often elective in the clinical years. Medical schools mentioned the difficulty of recruiting and training ESSPs and finding the funding to pay for their remuneration and travel expenses. INSIGHTS ESSPs were increasingly used in Japanese medical schools but they were haphazardly recruited from within the school or from the local community, not trained fully, and inconsistent performers. Nevertheless, an encounter with a non-Japanese English-speaking simulated patient was regarded effective in developing medical students' patient communication skills in English (language skills and cultural sensitivity). Ways must be found to assure the availability, quality, and sustainability of trained ESSPs so that more authentic practices and high-stakes skills exams can be introduced to ensure patient safety in the globalized world. As countries become more multicultural and international migration of healthcare professionals expands, ESSPs can be a valuable source for training and assessing international medical students and trainees' English-language patient interviewing skills. Regional hubs of ESSPs and the use of telehealth in collaboration with educators around the world could enhance the use of ESSPs worldwide.","output":"Survey of Japanese Medical Schools on Involvement of English-speaking Simulated Patients to Improve Students' Patient Communication Skills."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stroke prevention is essential for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but some receive sub-optimal management. We reviewed those with a recorded AF diagnosis assessed with CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score (SRS) and socio-demographic determinants of anticoagulation prescribing. The objective was to compare with national guidance recommendations, which recommend anticoagulant therapy for SRS  2, to determine if there were inequalities in management. METHODS A cross-sectional design was used to analyze records from all (n = 41) general practices in one London borough. Patients were excluded if they were <18 years, had AF resolved or diagnosed < 3 months. Logistic regression identified socio-demographic factors associated with high SRS and anticoagulant prescribing. RESULTS Of 2913 patients, 2885 (99.0%) had an SRS, and 2411 (83.6%) a score  2 and 82.9% (1999 of 2411) were prescribed anticoagulation. Women (compared with men), Black and Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups (compared with White), and those living in most deprived areas (compared with least) were more likely to have a score  2. Patients with a high SRS from Black and Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups and aged 18-74 years were less likely to be prescribed anticoagulation.

This notion is ambiguous as its interpretation can range from an electricity-only policy to portfolios of different energy vectors with a dominance of electricity. This ambiguity adds to the uncertainty that already pervades todays investment environment. This paper examines the centrality of electricity through a so-called variational scenario analysis with policies obtained by a mix of electricity-only and green gas penetration while maintaining constant decarbonization objectives. Electricity is a complex product that can only be further complicated by the high penetration of renewables and its interaction with the production and use of synthetic fuels. The variational scenario analysis is conducted with sufficiently fine (hourly) granularity to produce an adequate representation of these phenomena. It shows that tilting the central role of electricity to a mix of electricity and green gas offers several advantages in terms of efficiency, flexibility of investment strategies, and robustness with respect to major uncertainties. It shows that the variational scenario analysis can be extended to more complex mixes of policies.","output":"The Role of Electrification in the Decarbonization of Central-Western Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Removed (SEIAR) epidemic model is one of most frequently used epidemic models.

The many papers that have been written on this topic collectively stress the importance of this a priori analysis in the model development process. The story however, often ends with a structurally unidentifiable model. This may leave a model developer with no plan of action on how to address this potential issue. We continue this model exploration journey by identifying one of the possible sources of a models unidentifiability: problematic initial conditions. It is well-known that certain initial values may result in the loss of local structural identifiability. Nevertheless, literature on this topic has been limited to the analysis of small toy models. Here, we present a systematic approach to detect problematic initial conditions of real-world systems biology models, that are usually not small. A models identifiability can often be reinstated by changing the value of such problematic initial conditions. This provides modellers an option to resolve the unidentifiable model problem. Additionally, a good understanding of which initial values should rather be avoided can be very useful during experimental design. We show how our approach works in practice by applying it to five models. First, two small benchmark models are studied to get the reader acquainted with the method. The first one shows the effect of a zero-valued problematic initial condition. The second one illustrates that the approach also yields correct results in the presence of input signals and that problematic initial conditions need not be zero-values. For the remaining three examples, we set out to identify key initial values which may result in the structural unidentifiability. The third and fourth examples involve a systems biology Epo receptor model and a JAK/STAT model, respectively. In the final Pharmacokinetics model, of which its global structural identifiability has only recently been confirmed, we indicate that there are still sets of initial values for which this property does not hold.","output":"Assessing the role of initial conditions in the local structural identifiability of large dynamic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contemporary European societies are increasingly diverse. Migration both within and to Europe has contributed over the past decades to the rise of new religious, racial, ethnic, social, cultural and economic inequality. Such transformations have raised questions about the (multi-level) governance of diversity in Europe, thus determining new challenges for both scholars and policy-makers. Whilst the debate around diversity stemming from migration has become a major topic in urban studies, political science and sociology in Europe, Critical Race Studies and Intersectionality have become central in US approaches to understanding inequality and social injustice. Among the fields where managing diversity has become particularly pressing, methodological issues on how to best approach minorities that suffer from multiple discrimination represent some of the hottest subjects of concern. Stemming from the interest in putting into dialogue the existing American scholarship on CRT and anti-discrimination with the European focus on migrant integration, this paper explores the issue of integration in relation to intersectionality by merging the two frames. In doing so, it provides some observations about the complementarity of a racial justice approach for facing the new diversity-related challenges in European polity. In particular, it illustrates how Critical Race Studies can contribute to the analysis of inequality in Europe while drawing on the integration literature.","output":"Antidiscrimination Meets Integration Policies: Exploring New Diversity-Related Challenges in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are considered a promising therapeutic alternative for cancer. However, despite the development of novel OVs with improved efficacy and tumor selectivity, their limited efficacy as monotherapeutic agents remains a significant challenge. This study extended our previously observed combination effects of propranolol, a nonselective ?-blocker, and the T1012G oncolytic virus into colorectal cancer models. A cell viability assay showed that cotreatment could induce synergistic killing effects on human and murine colorectal cell lines. Moreover, cotreatment caused sustained tumor regression compared with T1012G monotherapy or propranolol monotherapy in human HCT116 and murine MC38 tumor models. The propranolol activity was not via a direct effect on viral replication in vitro or in vivo. Western blotting showed that cotreatment significantly enhanced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in HCT116 and MC38 cells compared with the propranolol or T1012G alone. In addition, propranolol or T1012G treatment induced a 35.06%  0.53% or 35.49%  2.68% reduction in VEGF secretion in HUVECs (p < 0.01/p < 0.01).

Accumulating evidence suggests that modern lifestyle characteristics such as the intake of energy-dense foods, adopting sedentary behavior, or exposure to environmental factors such as industrial endocrine disruptors all contribute to the rising obesity epidemic. Recent advances in the study of DNA and its alterations have considerably increased our understanding of the function of epigenetics in regulating energy metabolism and expenditure in obesity and metabolic diseases. These epigenetic modifications influence how DNA is transcribed without altering its sequence. They are dynamic, reflecting the interplay between the body and its surroundings. Notably, these epigenetic changes are reversible, making them appealing targets for therapeutic and corrective interventions.

The new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak is spreading rapidly worldwide. We collect arterial blood samples from 51 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Blood gas analysis is performed using a Siemens RAPID Point 500 blood gas analyzer. To accurately determine the factors that play a decisive role in the early recognition and discrimination of COVID-19 severity, a prediction framework that is based on an improved binary Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm in combination with a kernel extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. This method uses specular reflection learning to improve the original HHO algorithm and is referred to as HHOSRL. The experimental results show that the selected indicators, such as age, PaO(2), SaO(2)%, Na(+), and LAC, are essential for the early accurate assessment of COVID-19 severity by the feature selection method that is proposed in this paper.

In the attempt to control the spread of the disease and the pandemic, numerous COVID-19 vaccines are in development. A review of the evidence on their efficacy and safety are critical. Methods. A search for trials was done using the COVID-19 Living OVerview of Evidence (LOVE) platform. We also searched for relevant authorization documents and trial reports for COVID-19 vaccines of the US-Food and Drug Authority (US-FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United Kingdom Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the WHO website. We included studies that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: population C humans;intervention C COVID-19 vaccines;comparison C control or placebo;outcomes C efficacy and adverse events;methods C phase 3 randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened the reports, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data on the trial characteristics and results on vaccine efficacy and safety. The date of last search was March 11, 2021. Results. Interim results of trials investigating five vaccines were identified and included in the review. All five vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence: BNT162b2, VE 95% (95% CI 90.3, 97.6);mRNA-1273, VE 93.6% (95% CI 88.6, 96.5);ChAdOx1, VE 66.7% (95% CI 57.4, 74.0), Gam-COVID-Vac, VE 91.1% (95% CI 83.6, 95.1);and Ad26.CoV2.S, VE 67.2% (95% CI 59.3, 73.7). Data on the efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive, except for Ad26.CoV2.S, which demonstrated good efficacy in preventing moderate and/or severe COVID-19 infection and acceptable protection against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 28 days after vaccination (moderate certainty of evidence). Efficacy data on preventing death from COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive. Very limited phase 3 trial data is available to inform vaccine efficacy against the different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination with these five vaccines was associated with higher adverse reactions compared to control. These adverse events, due to reactions to the vaccines, were mild to moderate and of short duration. Available evidence on vaccine efficacy and safety is limited, mainly due to the short follow up and the small sample size of specific populations. Conclusion. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Gam-COVID-Vac and Ad26.CoV.S vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence.

However, questions remain regarding the sensitivity of WBE and its use in low prevalence settings. In this study, we estimated the total number of COVID-19 cases required for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. To do this, we leveraged a unique situation where, over a 4-month period, all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in a population of approximately 120,000, were precisely known and mainly located in a single managed isolation and quarantine facility (MIQF) building. From 9 July to 6 November 2020, 24-hr composite wastewater samples (n = 113) were collected daily from the sewer outside the MIQF, and from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located 5 km downstream. New daily COVID-19 cases at the MIQF ranged from 0 to 17, and for most of the study period there were no cases outside the MIQF identified. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 54.0% (61/113) at the WWTP, compared to 95.6% (108/113) at the MIQF. We used logistic regression to estimate the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into wastewater based on four infectious shedding models. With a total of 5 and 10 COVID-19 infectious cases per 100,000 population (0.005 % and 0.01% prevalence) the predicated probability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection at the WWTP was estimated to be 28 and 41%, respectively. When a more realistic proportional shedding model was used, this increased to 58% and 87% for 5 and 10 cases, respectively. In other words, when 10 individuals were actively shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a catchment of 100,000 individuals, there was a high likelihood of detecting viral RNA in wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detections at the WWTP were associated with increasing COVID-19 cases. Our results show that WBE provides a reliable and sensitive platform for detecting infections at the community scale, even when case prevalence is low, and can be of use as an early warning system for community outbreaks.

Nomograms for outcome prediction were constructed for the two treatment modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data for 1,745 Siewert II type AEG patients who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2015 were retrieved from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database. Patients were assigned to neoadjuvant radiotherapy (nRT) and non-neoadjuvant radiotherapy (non-nRT) groups based on treatment modality. Independent prognostic predictors were used to develop nomograms. Concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA) were used to determine the performance and prognostic value of the nomograms. The predictive accuracy of nomograms was compared with the prognostic value of the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. RESULTS The results showed that age, lymph node rate (LNR), and the number of removed lymph nodes (RLN) were independent prognostic factors for CSS in the nRT group. Tumor size, tumor grade, T stage, LNR, and therapy type were independent prognosis factors for CSS in patients in the non-nRT group. The C-indices for the nomograms were 0.652 (95% CI, 0.614-0.690) and 0.663 (95% CI, 0.606-0.720) in the training and validation cohort, respectively, for the nRT group. C-indices for the nomogram in non-nRT group were 0.754 (95% CI, 0.723-0.785) and 0.747 (95% CI, 0.688-0.800) for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. C-indices and ROC curves showed good predictive value compared with the TNM staging system in both groups. C-indices, as well as the AUC values of the nomograms and the TNM staging system for both cohorts in the non-nRT group were higher compared with those in the nRT group. Analysis of the survival calibration curve revealed high consistency between actual versus predicted outcomes determined by the nomograms. Decision curve analyses revealed that the new models had higher prediction value and clinical significance compared with TNM staging system. CONCLUSION The established nomograms showed high prognostic value for Siewert type II AEG patients in both nRT and non-nRT groups. In addition, the nomogram and the TNM staging systems showed better prognostic performance for patients in the non-nRT group compared with patients in the nRT group.","output":"Prognostic nomogram for Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction patients with and without neoadjuvant radiotherapy: a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated unprecedented changes to the functioning of hospitals across the world.

However, high legislative requirements on total contents of heavy metals represent a high barrier for bottom ash recycling in Switzerland. Therefore, the recycling potential is further evaluated based on the waste legislation applied in the Netherlands, where recycling of bottom ash has a long tradition. There, threshold values for bottom ash recycling are based on leachate concentrations and not on total contents as in Switzerland.

Data on COVID-19 vaccinations reported to CDC from 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and eight territories and freely associated states were analyzed to ascertain coverage with booster or additional primary doses among adults aged 65 years. During August 13-November 19, 2021, 18.7 million persons aged 65 years received a booster or additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine, constituting 44.1% of 42.5 million eligible* persons in this age group who previously completed a primary vaccination series.? Coverage was similar by sex and age group, but varied by primary series vaccine product and race and ethnicity, ranging from 30.3% among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons to 50.5% among non-Hispanic multiple/other race persons. Strategic efforts are needed to encourage eligible persons aged 18 years, especially those aged 65 years and those who are immunocompromised, to receive a booster and/or additional primary dose to ensure maximal protection against COVID-19.","output":"Booster and Additional Primary Dose COVID-19 Vaccinations Among Adults Aged 65 Years  United States, August 13, 2021CNovember 19, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to compare maternal and pregnancy outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women were divided into two groups based on status at admission, symptomatic or asymptomatic. All testing was done by nasopharyngeal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery. Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [n = 60] or exposure only [n = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic). In total, there were 46 symptomatic women and 22 asymptomatic women (tested based on exposure only [n = 12] or as part of universal screening [n = 10]) with confirmed COVID-19. Of symptomatic women (n = 46), 27.3% had preterm delivery and 26.1% needed respiratory support while none of the asymptomatic women (n = 22) had preterm delivery or need of respiratory support (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women. It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.

This study aimed to determine the durability of skills acquired after initial training. METHODS For this study, 21 novice medical students were enrolled in institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols at two institutions. As previously reported, all the participants successfully completed a structured proficiency-based training curriculum by practicing the five FLS tasks in a distributed fashion over a 2-month period. Pre- and posttesting was conducted, and standard testing metrics were used. The participants were recruited for repeat testing 6 months (retention 1) and 1 year (retention 2) after initial curriculum completion. Of the original 21 students, 15 (10 at University of Texas Southwestern and 5 at Uniformed Services University) were available and agreed to participate. The participants had no additional skills lab training and minimal clinical laparoscopic exposure. RESULTS None of the 15 participants demonstrated proficiency at the initial pretest (mean score, 146  65), and performance showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) at the posttest (469  20). The participants retained a very high level of performance at retention 1 (437  39; 93% retention of the posttest score) and retention 2 (444  55; 95% retention of the posttest score). Their performance at both retention testing-intervals was sufficient for passing the certification exam (270 cutoff score for passing) with a comfortable margin. There were no significant differences in performance between the two institutions at any time points. CONCLUSION The proficiency-based FLS skills curriculum reliably results in a high level of skill retention, even in the absence of ongoing simulator-based training or clinical experience. This curriculum is suitable for widespread implementation.","output":"Proficiency-based Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery skills training results in durable performance improvement and a uniform certification pass rate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutational inactivation of VHL is the earliest genetic event in the majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), leading to accumulation of the HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcription factors. While correlative studies of human ccRCC and functional studies using human ccRCC cell lines have implicated HIF-1 as an inhibitor and HIF-2 as a promoter of aggressive tumour behaviours, their roles in tumour onset have not been functionally addressed. Herein we show using an autochthonous ccRCC model that Hif1a is essential for tumour formation whereas Hif2a deletion has only minor effects on tumour initiation and growth. Both HIF-1 and HIF-2 are required for the clear cell phenotype. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that HIF-1 regulates glycolysis while HIF-2 regulates genes associated with lipoprotein metabolism, ribosome biogenesis and E2F and MYC transcriptional activities. HIF-2-deficient tumours are characterised by increased antigen presentation, interferon signalling and CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Single copy loss of HIF1A or high levels of HIF2A mRNA expression correlate with altered immune microenvironments in human ccRCC. These studies reveal an oncogenic role of HIF-1 in ccRCC initiation and suggest that alterations in the balance of HIF-1 and HIF-2 activities can affect different aspects of ccRCC biology and disease aggressiveness.","output":"HIF-1 and HIF-2 differently regulate tumour development and inflammation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cell line, designated A-72, for virus studies was established from a tumor surgically removed from a female, 8-year-old Golden Retriever dog.

The drugs were primarily screened against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. With an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat the virus, we have explored natural products isolated from edible and medicinal mushrooms that have been reported to possess anti-HIV protease. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: We have examined 36 compounds for their potential to be SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors using molecular docking study. Moreover, drug-likeness properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity were evaluated by in silico ADMET analysis. RESULTS: Our AutoDock study showed that 25 of 36 candidate compounds have the potential to inhibit the main viral protease based on their binding affinity against the enzymes active site when compared to the standard drugs. Interestingly, ADMET analysis and toxicity prediction revealed that 6 out of 25 compounds are the best drug-like property candidates, including colossolactone VIII, colossolactone E, colossolactone G, ergosterol, heliantriol F and velutin.

Demographic and disease-specific data were recorded. Humoral response was compared across treatment and disease groups, and with respect to receipt of booster vaccinations. Age and sex adjusted SARS-CoV-2 antibody response was modelled over time. Marginal mean antibody levels and marginal risks of poor response were calculated at weekly intervals starting from week-8 after the first vaccination up to week 40.

Methods: Real-time data query was done based on daily observations using publicly available data from reference websites for COVID-19 and other government official reports for the period (15th February, 2020 to April 28th, 2020). Statistical analysis was performed to draw important inferences regarding COVID-19 trend in India. Results: A decrease in growth rate of cases due to COVID-19 in India post lockdown and improvement in recovery rate during the month of April was identified.

Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, is well-established throughout the state of Florida, United States. Autochthonous transmission of dengue virus to humans in Florida has been increasing since 2009, alongside consistent importation of dengue cases. However, most cases of first infection with dengue are asymptomatic and the virus can be maintained in mosquito populations, complicating surveillance and leading to an underestimation of disease risk. Metagenomic sequencing of A. aegypti mosquitoes in Manatee County, Florida revealed the presence of dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4) genomes in mosquitoes from multiple trapping sites over 2years, in the absence of a human DENV-4 index case, and even though a locally acquired case of DENV-4 has never been reported in Florida. This finding suggested that: (i) DENV-4 may circulate among humans undetected; (ii) the virus was being maintained in the mosquito population, or (iii) the detected complete genome sequence may not represent a viable virus. This study demonstrates that an infectious clone generated from the Manatee County DENV-4 (DENV-4M) sequence is capable of infecting mammalian and insect tissue culture systems, as well as adult female A. aegypti mosquitoes when fed in a blood meal. However, the virus is subject to a dose dependent infection barrier in mosquitoes, and has a kinetic delay compared to a phylogenetically related wild-type (WT) control virus from a symptomatic child, DENV-4H (strain Homo sapiens/Haiti-0075/2015, GenBank accession MK514144.1). DENV-4M disseminates from the midgut to the ovary and saliva at 14days post-infection. Viral RNA was also detectable in the adult female offspring of DENV-4M infected mosquitoes. These results demonstrate that the virus is capable of infecting vector mosquitoes, is transmissible by bite, and is vertically transmitted, indicating a mechanism for maintenance in the environment without human-mosquito transmission. These findings suggest undetected human-mosquito transmission and/or long-term maintenance of the virus in the mosquito population is occurring in Florida, and underscore the importance of proactive surveillance for viruses in mosquitoes.","output":"Infection Kinetics and Transmissibility of a Reanimated Dengue Virus Serotype 4 Identified Originally in Wild Aedes aegypti From Florida"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic with a high growth rate of confirmed cases.

Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3UTR. Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. This analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cis-regulatory RNA structures or sequences, as rapidly emerging variations in these regions could lead to drug resistance.","output":"Analysis of Rapidly Emerging Variants in Structured Regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was to evaluate the potential of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA MEG3) in predicting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk and its correlation with prognosis in sepsis patients. METHODS: The plasma samples were obtained from 112 sepsis patients within 24 hours after admission and 100 healthy controls (HCs) at enrollment. The lncRNA MEG3 expression in plasma samples was determined by RT-qPCR. In sepsis patients, ARDS occurrence was assessed based on Berlin definition of ARDS and 28-day mortality risk was evaluated. RESULTS: LncRNA MEG3 expression was increased in sepsis patients compared with HCs. During 28-day duration, 30 sepsis patients occurred ARDS and 82 sepsis patients did not occur ARDS. LncRNA MEG3 expression was elevated in ARDS sepsis patients compared with non-ARDS sepsis patients, then the following receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis disclosed that lncRNA MEG3 predicted ARDS risk (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.775), which was further validated as an independent risk factor by multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG3 was positively correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, sequential organ failure assessment score, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein, while negatively correlated with albumin in sepsis patients. Additionally, lncRNA MEG3 was elevated in 28-day deaths compared with 28-day survivors, and it predicted 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients (AUC = 0.708) by ROC curve analysis. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 might represent as a valuable biomarker for individualizing prevention strategies against ARDS and improving prognosis in sepsis.","output":"The value of circulating long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 as a predictor of higher acute respiratory distress syndrome risk and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Has the world's most populous nation learnt the lessons of last year's SARS outbreak?

The biosensors are capable of being on-site, fast, and extremely sensitive to the target viral antigen, opening the door for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. They can screen individuals in hospitals, airports, and other crowded locations. Microfluidics and nanotechnology are promising cornerstones for the development of biosensor-based techniques.

Eligible studies included those that reported on performing a virtual spine physical examination. Two reviewers independently assessed all potential studies for eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcome of interest was the reliability of the virtual spine physical exam. Secondary outcomes of interest were patient satisfaction with the virtual encounter. RESULTS: A total of 2321 studies were initially screened.

These studies showed acceptable reliability for portions of the low back virtual exam. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2 of the studies and showed general satisfaction (>80% would recommend). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the virtual spine examination may be comparable to the in-person physical examination for low back pain, though there is a significant void in the literature regarding the reliability of the physical examination as it pertains to specific surgical pathology of the spine.

Five quinoa proteins were hydrolyzed in silico by papain and subtilisin. Among the 1465 peptides generated, seven could interact stably with the key binding residues and catalytic residues of the viral targets, mainly via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The seven peptides were comparable or superior to previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on docking scores. Key residues in the seven peptides contributing to binding to viral targets were determined by computational alanine scanning. The seven peptides were predicted in silico to be non-toxic and non-allergenic. The peptides ranged between 546.66 and 3974.87 g/mol in molecular mass, besides exhibiting basic and cationic properties (isoelectric points: 8.26C12.10; net charges: 0.1C4.0).

Our group has published that bronchial epithelial cells from atopic normal and asthmatic patients and treated with Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a type 2 cytokine, suppressed gene expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Kimura H, et al. 2020). To further complement our studies, we examined ACE2 gene expression from individuals with severe asthma, and also assessed ACE2 protein levels from all groups. Because ACE2 is expressed in nasal epithelium, we also examined the effects of IL-13 on ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells. Objective: To determine if ACE2 gene and protein expression in upper and lower airways is modulated by IL-13. Methods: Non-atopic and atopic non-asthmatic normal, nonsevere and severe asthmatic participants were recruited and underwent bronchoscopy and nasal brushings to obtain primary bronchial and nasal epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were cultured at ALI for 2 weeks. Cells were treated with IL-13 (10 ng/ml) for 48 hours for gene expression and at 10, 50 and 100 ng/ml for 72 hours to determine protein expression from cell lysates by ELISA. Results: In bronchial epithelial cells, gene expression of ACE2 decreased following IL-13 treatment compared to untreated control: mean reduction: 0.52  0.12 (p&lt;.001) in atopic normal cells, 0.67  0.14 (p=0.038) in non-severe asthma cells, and 0.66  0.03 (p&lt;.001) in severe asthma cells. There was no significant difference in the reduction in ACE2 gene expression between these three groups following IL-13 treatment. In nasal epithelial cells, the mean reduction in ACE2 gene expression was 0.42  0.08 (p&lt;.001) in atopic normal cells and 0.48  0.01 (p&lt;.001) in non-severe asthma cells) compared to untreated control.

IL-13 also reduced ACE2 protein expression in atopic normal and non-severe asthma group (p=0.033 and 0.003, respectively) in nasal epithelial cells. Conclusion: IL-13 attenuates ACE2 gene expression and protein production in both nasal and bronchial epithelial cells regardless of asthma and atopic status.

METHODS 24 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients were selected from the intensive care unit (ICU) or the high acuity ward of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. RESULTS The rate of VTE was 25% and mortality rate was 16.7%. Fibrinogen and D-Dimers were elevated, 7.9 (1.6) g/L and 2.4 (2.02) ug/ml respectively. Factor VIIIc and von vWF antigen levels were both extremely elevated at 279 (148) u/dL and 350 (131) % respectively, which are comparable to levels seen in ICU patients with severe sepsis. vWF levels were significantly higher in patients that died (p=0.017) and showed a positive correlation with age.

The MME principle is one of the three universal design for learning (UDL) key principles, which guides on how diverse groups of learners can be effectively catered for. The empirical processes, premised on a phenomenological case study, commenced with focus group discussions with 8 high school mathematics teachers from a previously disadvantaged area, who have prior-training in MME. A free attitude interview (FAI) technique was used, to afford the teachers the opportunity to share their insights into the application of MME in their pandemic-regulated classrooms. The content analysis of the teachers' reflections revealed the following aspects: clear instructions, step-by-step guides, checklists to enhance self-regulation, varying demand and resources to meet challenges, fostering collaboration, providing corrective feedback to sustain effort and persistence, addressing mathematical vocabulary and using real-life situations to recruit interest. These strategies were found not only essential in maximising learning in mathematics under normal circumstances, but also indispensable during the prevailing conditions of the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot natural experiment, only a subset of patients used inpatient virtual care. When used, virtual care was associated with reductions in PPE use, reductions in exposure risk, and patient and provider satisfaction.","output":"Evaluation of an Intrahospital Telemedicine Program for Patients Admitted With COVID-19: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution of the national vaccination programme in Norway and how changes in national policy informed by risk and equity shaped international vaccine debates, public trust and vaccine hesitancy.

RESULTS: Process equity founded on social solidarity was central to the approach taken to vaccination in Norway but within the context of a very low level of COVID-19 Infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of Norway with very low levels of infection, the risks associated with vaccine side effects were of a similar order to the risk of infection which led to an early decision to exclude the AstraZeneca vaccine and limit access to the Janssen vaccine. Public trust in the way the state managed the changes in the vaccination programme resulted in very limited public resistance to the vaccine programme, high levels of vaccine uptake and an acceptance of delays associated with the exclusion of two approved vaccines.

METHODS: All citizens above ten years of age resident in 5 municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, were invited to participate in the study. Overall, among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between May 5 and 15, 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyzer. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positives for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least 1 symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those resulting seropositive was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was 3-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially of younger age, and/or who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in an area of North-eastern Italy with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition in which kidney function has permanently declined such that renal replacement therapy* is required to sustain life (1). The mortality rate for patients with ESRD in the United States has been declining since 2001 (2). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients are at high risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, which is due, in part, to weakened immune systems and presence of multiple comorbidities (3-5). The ESRD National Coordinating Center (ESRD NCC) supports the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the ESRD Networks?, through analysis of data, dissemination of best practices, and creation of educational materials. ESRD NCC analyzed deaths reported to the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb), a system that facilitates the collection of data and maintenance of information about ESRD patients on chronic dialysis or receiving a kidney transplant who are treated in Medicare-certified dialysis facilities and kidney transplant centers in the United States. Excess death estimates were obtained by comparing observed and predicted monthly numbers of deaths during February 1-August 31, 2020; predicted deaths were modeled based on data from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. The analysis estimated 8.7-12.9 excess deaths per 1,000 ESRD patients, or a total of 6,953-10,316 excess deaths in a population of 798,611 ESRD patients during February 1-August 31, 2020. These findings suggest that deaths among ESRD patients during the early phase of the pandemic exceeded those that would have been expected based on previous years' data. Geographic and temporal patterns of excess mortality, including those among persons with ESRD, should be considered during planning and implementation of interventions, such as COVID-19 vaccination, infection control guidance, and patient education. These findings underscore the importance of data-driven technical assistance and further analyses of the causes and patterns of excess deaths in ESRD patients.","output":"Excess Death Estimates in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease  United States, FebruaryCAugust 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an overview of the response of Australian courts to the COVID-19 crisis, and critically examines a number of structures and systemic issues that arise from the shift to the online deliver of justice It places the current responses in the context of the emerging literature regarding online dispute resolution, and draws upon that literature to consider issues including open justice, symbolism and 'court architecture' in the digital space, technological limitations, access to justice and issues of systemic bias It argues that by examining these issues, the present crisis will help map opportunities for future reform","output":"Civil courts and COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the widespread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the inactivation of bacteria and viruses using ultraviolet (UV) light has been reevaluated.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but mice are resistant to the infection because their ACE2 is incompatible with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Methods: We generated a mouse-adapted strain SARS-CoV-2 by serial passages in the lung of BALB/c mice. Complete genome deep sequencing of different generations of viruses was performed to characterize the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis and Biolayer interferometry experiments demonstrated that two mutations in RBD significantly increased its binding affinity towards mouse ACE2. Significantly, TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod block SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo. Findings: We adapted a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 by serial passages in the lung of BALB/c mice. The mouse-adapted strain WBP-1 showed increased infectivity in BALB/c mice and led to severe interstitial pneumonia. We characterized the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that Q493K and Q498H in RBD significantly increased its binding affinity towards mouse ACE2. Additionally, The TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod was able to protect mice against WBP-1 challenge, demonstrating this mouse-adapted strain is a useful tool to investigate COVID-19 and develop new therapies. Interpretation: We found for the first time that the Q493K and Q498H mutations in the RBD of WBP-1 enhanced its interactive affinities with mACE2. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 provides a valuable tool for the evaluation of novel antiviral and vaccine strategies, especially in determining the immunopathological consequences of any intervention.

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of 'proximity events' these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for 'intelligent physical distancing' in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response.

The data were analyzed by codes diarrhea, dyspnea, fever and general discomfort that were used as predictor variables, and their relationship with hospital admissions and ICU admissions. Results. A total of 831,943 calls were received at the CLM emergency call center through 112, with a maximum on March 13, 2020 with 10,582 calls. On COVID line, a total of 208,803 calls were received in that period, with a maximum on March 15 with 23,744.

However, SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect vascular endothelium and subsequently cause vascular inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque instability and thereby result in both endothelial dysfunction and myocardial inflammation/infarction. Interestingly, up to 50% of patients suffer from persistent exercise dyspnoea and a post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) after having overcome an acute COVID-19 infection. In the present study, we assessed the presence of coronary microvascular disease (CMD) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in post-COVID-19 patients still suffering from exercise dyspnoea and PVFS. N = 22 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, N = 16 patients with classic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and N = 17 healthy control patients without relevant cardiac disease underwent dedicated vasodilator-stress CMR studies on a 1.5-T MR scanner. The CMR protocol comprised cine and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging as well as velocity-encoded (VENC) phase-contrast imaging of the coronary sinus flow (CSF) at rest and during pharmacological stress (maximal vasodilation induced by 400 g IV regadenoson). Using CSF measurements at rest and during stress, global myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated. There was no difference in left ventricular ejection-fraction (LV-EF) between COVID-19 patients and controls (60% [57C63%] vs. 63% [60C66%], p = NS). There were only N = 4 COVID-19 patients (18%) showing a non-ischemic pattern of LGE. VENC-based flow measurements showed that CSF at rest was higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (1.78 ml/min [1.19C2.23 ml/min] vs. 1.14 ml/min [0.91C1.32 ml/min], p = 0.048). In contrast, CSF during stress was lower in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.33 ml/min [2.76C4.20 ml/min] vs. 5.32 ml/min [3.66C5.52 ml/min], p = 0.05). A significantly reduced MPR was calculated in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (2.73 [2.10C4.15C11] vs. 4.82 [3.70C6.68], p = 0.005). No significant differences regarding MPR were detected between COVID-19 patients and HCM patients. In post-COVID-19 patients with persistent exertional dyspnoea and PVFS, a significantly reduced MPR suggestive of CMDsimilar to HCM patientswas observed in the present study. A reduction in MPR can be caused by preceding SARS-CoV-2-associated direct as well as secondary triggered mechanisms leading to diffuse CMD, and may explain ongoing symptoms of exercise dyspnoea and PVFS in some patients after COVID-19 infection.","output":"A cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging-based pilot study to assess coronary microvascular disease in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nothing is as it seems, nothing happens by chance, and everything is connectedThese three basic assumptions characterize conspiracy theories of different provenance.

Since COVID-19 management differs over time, it is hard to determine which therapy is more efficacious.

METHODS: A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, we found that early initiation of FPV treatment did not have a positive effect on the estimated survival time.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether the distribution of conventional (CD16neg) and CD16pos monocytes is different in patients with COVID-19 and whether the variations could be predictive of the outcome of the disease. METHODS We performed a prospective study on 390 consecutive patients referred to the Emergency Unit, with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection by RT-PCR. Using the CytoDiff? reagent, an automated routine leukocyte differential, we quantified CD16neg and CD16pos monocytes. RESULTS In the entire population, median CD16neg and CD16pos monocyte levels (0.398 and 0.054  109/L, respectively) were in the normal range [(0.3-0.7  109/L) and (0.015-0.065  109/L), respectively], but the 35 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a significantly (p<0.001) lower CD16pos monocyte count (0.018  109/L) in comparison to the 70 patients who were discharged (0.064  109/L) or were hospitalized in conventional units (0.058  109/L).

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically.

METHODS: A real-time reverse transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of canine distemper virus (CDV) using primers and exo probe targeting the CDV nucleocapsid protein gene was developed. A series of other viruses were tested by the RT-RPA.Thirty-two field samples were further tested by RT-RPA, and the resuts were compared with those obtained by the real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The RT-RPA assay was performed successfully at 40 C, and the results were obtained within 3 minC12 min. The assay could detect CDV, but did not show cross-detection of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), demonstrating high specificity. The analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA was 31.8 copies in vitro transcribed CDV RNA, which is 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was validated by testing 32 field samples and compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-RPA and a reference real-time RT-PCR method. Both assays provided the same results, and R(2) value of the positive results was 0.947.

Along with the rest of India, lockdowns (of varying degrees) have been in effect in Mumbai since March 25, 2020. Given the large economic toll on the country from the lockdown and the related restrictions on mobility of people and goods, swift opening of the economy especially in a financial hub such as Mumbai becomes critical. In this report, we use the IISc-TIFR agent based simulator to develop long term projections for Mumbai under realistic scenarios related to Mumbai's opening of the workplaces, or equivalently, the economy, and the associated public transportation through local trains and buses. These projections were developed taking into account a possible second wave if the economy and the local trains are fully opened either on November 1, 2020 or on January 1, 2021. The impact on infection spread in Mumbai if the schools and colleges open on January first week 2021 is also considered. We also try to account for the increased intermingling amongst the population during the Ganeshotsav festival as well as around the Navratri/Dussehra and Diwali festival. Our conclusion, based on our simulations, is that the impact of fully opening up the economy on November 1 is manageable provided reasonable medical infrastructure is in place.

The impact of shelter-in-place orders on older adults' health and well-being is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with and without frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study based on structured telephone interviews. SETTING: Four geriatric outpatient clinics in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 557 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: The Life-Space Assessment was used to measure community mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a previously validated decrease of &#8805; 5 points defined restricted life-space mobility. Frailty was assessed through the FRAIL (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight) scale. The impact of shelter-in-place orders on QoL was evaluated with the question ?How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your QoL, to which participants could respond ?not at all?, ?to some extent?, or ?to a great extent?. We used ordinal logistic regressions to investigate the relationship between restricted life-space mobility and impact on QoL, adjusting our analyses for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, cognition, functionality, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. We explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on QoL. RESULTS: Participants were on average 808 years old, 65% were women, and 33% were frail. The COVID-19 quarantine led to a restriction of community mobility in 79% of participants and affected the QoL for 77% of participants. We found that restricted life-space mobility was associated with impact on QoL in older adults during the pandemic, although frailty modified the magnitude of the association (P-value for interaction=0.03). Frail participants who experienced restricted life-space mobility had twice the odds of reporting an impact on QoL when compared with non-frail individuals, with respective adjusted odds ratios of 4.20 (95% CI=2.36-7.50) and 2.18 (95% CI=1.33-3.58). CONCLUSION: Older adults experienced substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this unexpected change impacted their QoL.

This feasibility study aimed to gather the essential data needed to design and power a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of a digital intervention in reducing the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy. In order to do this, we carried out a single-centre RCT, which explored the knowledge, attitudes and risk reduction behaviours in women in the intervention and treatment as usual groups, pre- and post-intervention. METHODS: CMV seronegative women living with a child less than four years old, receiving antenatal care at a single UK tertiary centre, were randomised to the digital intervention or 'treatment as usual' groups. Participants completed questionnaires before the digital intervention and after and at 34 gestational weeks, and responses within groups and between groups were compared using tailored randomisation tests. CMV serology was tested in the first trimester and at the end of pregnancy. RESULTS: Of the 878 women screened, 865 samples were analysed with 43% (n = 372) being CMV seronegative and therefore eligible to take part in the RCT; of these, 103 (27.7%) women were enrolled and 87 (84%) of these completed the study. Most participants (n = 66; 64%) were unfamiliar with CMV at enrolment, however at 34 gestational weeks, women in the intervention group (n = 51) were more knowledgeable about CMV compared to the treatment as usual group (n = 52) and reported engaging in activities that may increase the risk of CMV transmission less frequently. The digital intervention was highly acceptable to pregnant women. Overall, four participants seroconverted over the course of the study: two from each study group. CONCLUSIONS: A large multi-centre RCT investigating the efficacy of a CMV digital intervention is feasible in the United Kingdom; this study has generated essential data upon which to power such a study. This single-centre feasibility RCT demonstrates that a digital educational intervention is associated with increase in knowledge about CMV and can result in behaviour change which may reduce the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy.

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","output":"Multi-Center Study of Temporal Changes and Prognostic Value of a CT Visual Severity Score in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global crisis, resulting in 0.5 billion infections and over 6 million deaths as of March 2022. Fortunately, infection and hospitalization rates were curbed due to the rollout of DNA and mRNA vaccines. However, the efficacy of these vaccines significantly drops a few months post immunization, from 88% down to 47% in the case of the Pfizer BNT162 vaccine. The emergence of variant strains, especially delta and omicron, have also significantly reduced vaccine efficacy. We propose peptide vaccines as a potential solution to address the inadequacies of the current vaccines. Peptide vaccines can be easily modified to target emerging strains, have greater stability, and do not require cold-chain storage. We screened five peptide fragments (B1CB5) derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to identify neutralizing B-cell peptide antigens. We then investigated adjuvant systems for efficient stimulation of immune responses against the most promising peptide antigens, including liposomal formulations of polyleucine (L10) and polymethylacrylate (PMA), as well as classical adjuvants (CFA and MF59). Immune efficacy of formulations was evaluated using competitive ELISA, pseudovirion neutralization, and live virus neutralization assays. Unfortunately, peptide conjugation to L10 and PMA dramatically altered the secondary structure, resulting in low antibody neutralization efficacy. Of the peptides tested, only B3 administered with CFA or MF59 was highly immunogenic. Thus, a peptide vaccine relying on B3 may provide an attractive alternative to currently marketed vaccines.","output":"Peptide-Based Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: Peptide Antigen Discovery and Screening of Adjuvant Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delayed delivery, poor fitting and discomfort of customised orthoses are reported in rehabilitation clinics as resulting in more invasive interventions.

A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations, while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.","output":"Staggered Release Policies for COVID-19 Control: Costs and Benefits of Sequentially Relaxing Restrictions by Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study has investigated the role of meteorology and air quality for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

During late monsoon onwards, recovery rate was getting more than the infections which indicate that lesser temperature and good rainfall could help the air to be freshen. Through air pollution was greater during winter and post monsoon than the summer season in India the higher recovery rate was counted during post-monsoon and winter which suggest that patients may require lesser temperate ambient for better recovery. Spatial patterns also suggest that north-eastern hilly region followed by districts located in the northern mountain had better recovery where the pollutants concentration was also quite lower during the study period.

DESIGN: cross-sectional study based on the record linkage of the COVID-19 notification system, the regional population health register and the 2011 census data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: residents in Emilia-Romagna who were grouped according to three ESEMs calculated at census block level: the index of deprivation, the household crowding, and the percentage of the foreign resident population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. RESULTS: during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COVID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COVID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gradients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality.

At issue is whether a compromise emerges as the dust of conflict thickens. Military coups more than parliamentary solutions determined past outcomes after unworkable tension and turmoil. But this time, a putsch under a new reign may not succeed in clearing the slate for a reset. Thailand is facing an uncharted and precarious frontier.

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020. STUDY DESIGN: From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.","output":"The implications of preliminary screening and diagnosis: Clinical characteristics of 33 mild patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hunan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 brought unprecedented publicity for modelling and simulation But a broad audience was left with very little information about what modern simulation models have to take into account and how valuable they have become as decision-support-tool And how versatile: by far not limited to health-care","output":"How an Agent-Based Population Model Became a Key-Element of the Austrian Effort Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Japan, routine two-dose immunization against varicella has been conducted among children at ages of 12 and 36 months since 2014, and the vaccination coverage has reached around 90%. To understand the impact of routine varicella vaccination, we reconstructed the epidemiological dynamics of varicella in Japan. METHODS: Epidemiological and demographic datasets over the past three decades were analyzed to reconstruct the number of susceptible individuals by age and year. To estimate the annual risk of varicella infection, we fitted a balance equation model to the annual number of cases from 1990 to 2019. Using parameter estimates, we reconstructed varicella dynamics starting from 1990 and modeled future dynamics until 2033. RESULTS: Overall varicella incidence declined over time and the annual risk of infection among children younger than 10 years old decreased monotonically starting in 2014. Conversely, varicella incidence among teenagers (age 10 to 14 years) has increased each year since 2014. A substantial number of unvaccinated individuals born before the routine immunization era remained susceptible and aged without contracting varicella, while the annual risk of infection among teenagers aged 10 to 14 years increased starting in 2011 despite gradual expansion of varicella vaccine coverage. The number of susceptible individuals decreased over time in all age groups. Modeling indicated that susceptibility rates among pre-school children aged 1 to 4 years will remain low. CONCLUSION: Routine varicella vaccination has successfully reduced infections in pre-school and early primary school age children, but has also resulted in increased infection rates among adolescents. This temporary increase was caused both by the increased age of susceptible individuals and increased transmission risk among adolescents resulting from the dynamic nature of varicella transmission.

An outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to submission of rats with dyspnea, sneezing, lethargy, nasal discharge, and/or unexpected death for diagnostic evaluation. Necropsy revealed underlying megaesophagus in Rbm20(C/C) rats. Further phenotyping of this rat strain and determination of the size of esophageal TTN was undertaken. The Rbm20-defective rats developed megaesophagus at an early age (26 weeks) with high frequency (13/32, 41%). They also often exhibited secondary rhinitis (9/32, 28%), aspiration pneumonia (8/32, 25%), and otitis media/interna (6/32, 19%). In addition, these rats had a high prevalence of hydronephrosis (13/32, 41%). RBM20 is involved in splicing multiple RNA transcripts, one of which is the muscle-specific protein TTN. Rbm20 mutations are a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. In Rbm20-defective rats, TTN size was significantly increased in the skeletal muscle of the esophagus. Megaesophagus in this rat strain (maintained on a mixed genetic background) is hypothesized to result from altered TTN stretch signaling in esophageal skeletal muscle.

METHOD: We conducted a prospective study in 2 gerontologic COVID units in Paris, France, from March 14, 2020, to May 7, 2020. Patients with dementia hospitalised for confirmed COVID-19 infection were systematically enrolled. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality at 21 days. RESULTS: We included 125 patients. Median age was 86 (IQI 82-90); 59.4% were female. Most common causes of dementia were Alzheimer's disease, mixed dementia and vascular dementia. 67.2% had &#8805; 2 comorbidities; 40.2% lived in a long-term care facility. The most common symptoms at COVID-19 onset were confusion and delirium (82.4%), asthenia (76.8%) and fever (72.8%) before polypnea (51.2%) and desaturation (50.4%). Falls were frequent at the initial phase of the disease (35.2%). The fatality rate at 21 days was 22.4%. Chronic kidney disease and CRP at admission were independent factors of death. Persisting confusion, mood and behavioural disorders were observed in survivors (19.2%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in demented individuals is associated with severe outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and is characterised by specific clinical features and complications, with confusion and delirium at the forefront.

The government is strategically expanding the scope of community ownership and increasing understanding in the population through risk communication and engagement; still, the situation remains very austere and is even affecting the psychological health of caregivers. We, therefore, sought to determine the impact of psychosocial job demands and resources associated with the psychological health of nurses in a time lag duration of 3 months, i.e., since the start of the pandemic, from January to March 2020. We hypothesized the significant mediating roles of stress and eustress in a direct relationship with psychosocial work environment job demands, job resources, and nurses wellbeing. METHODS: In this cross-sectional self-administrated study, we distributed the survey in two parts by using a time-lag strategy to collect data at the start of pandemic (Time 1) and then again 3 months later (Time 2). Data on 53 items was collected from 208 female nurses who had participated in both the time phases and met the eligibility protocols of the study (such as being certified female nurses who have a registration number (RN) through the Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC), having 4 years of a generic nursing degree, and 2 years of nursing experience). FINDINGS: We have achieved three stages through our analytic study on the nurses samples to determine the predictive abilities for the quality of the psychosocial work environment model. The coefficient of determination is R2, while the effect size is f2. We found 29.0% variance, 0.05 and 0.03 effect size, and 0.153 predictive abilities on stress as explained by job demands, and 53.4% variance, 0.19 and 0.39 effect size, and 0.275 predictive abilities on eustress as explained by job resources.

The global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems, and caused widespread social and economic disruption. Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment and mitigation. The process of collecting and recording vital signs can be a time- consuming process without the right tools. The main motive of the invention disclosed here is the integrated portable healthcare solution that will help in quickly carrying out Covid screening vital test measurements such as temperature, pulse and blood pressure which will not only be used during epidemic/pandemic but also during other emergencies/patient triages and also to keep a track of all affected Covid patient's screening results by the healthcare professionals. Monitoring of vital signs is necessary for the efficient and effective patient management. Vital signs are regularly measured at specific intervals in patients in the Emergency department or remotely. This project mainly focuses on the integration of three sensors (i.e.) MAX30100 sensor, MLX sensor and digital BP sensor and producing the values in the same kit. This smart device is used to monitor the person's temperature, blood pressure, SpO2, heart rate and by comparing all the four threshold values, the final result is displayed as normal or abnormal values simultaneously in the mobile app and the LCD display. The system can be used remotely as well in the healthcare setting where patients are in the waiting queue. Based on the results, intimation messages are sent to the concerned patient or healthcare professional who's mobile is linked with the device and in abnormal conditions, the alert message is sent to quarantine themselves from the general public. This continuous monitoring helps in the initial screening for Covid-19 at the early stage, where the results can be checked and timely advices can be given by the family members, doctors and the medical professionals. ? 2022 IEEE.","output":"Smart Multifunctional Vital Testing Kit for Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adjuvants are common vaccine components Novel adjuvants may improve the protective immunity conferred by vaccines against poultry diseases Here, a less-hemolytic saponin, platycodin D (PD), isolated from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum was investigated as a potential alternative adjuvant PD was tested as an adjuvant in the infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine, because the existing IB vaccine has often failed to induce effective immune responses The adjuvant activity of PD in conjunction with IB vaccine was evaluated in this study Compared to control treatment, PD treatment significantly increased the proliferation of chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concentration of interferon-gamma in culture supernatants, and anti-IB antibody titer In chickens pre-challenged with the Mass 41 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), PD administration resulted in fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower mortality rate, and higher protection compared to control treatment Histopathological examination showed that the lungs and kidneys of PD-treated chickens displayed fewer pathological lesions than those of control chickens Our results also demonstrated that this new vaccine adjuvant improved chicken humoral and cellular immune responses without any side effects Hence, our findings suggest that PD might serve as an effective adjuvant in IBV vaccines","output":"Adjuvant effects of platycodin D on immune responses to infectious bronchitis vaccine in chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genetic determinism of viral traits can generally be dissected using either forward or reverse genetics because the clonal reproduction of viruses does not require the use of approaches based on laboratory crosses.

This study compared the anxiety level of the frontline dental staff (FDS) to the general public in Yichang during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examined potential explanatory factors to the differences. Methods: : Two online questionnaires were used separately to collect data from FDS and the general public. The Chinese version of Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was included for the assessment of anxiety. Firstly, a Chi-square test was conducted to compare the anxiety state between these two groups. Then, a bivariate analysis using Cramers V and Eta squared was conducted to find the potential factors. Lastly, a binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between potential factors and the anxiety state of FDS. Results: : In general, FDS were 4.342 (95% CI: 2.427-7.768) times more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public. The bivariate analysis showed that age, Level Three Protective Measures (PM-3), conflicts with patients and/or colleagues were moderately associated with the anxiety state of FDS. But the knowledge of COVID-19, the treatment to suspected or confirmed cases both had a weak association with the anxiety among FDS. Conversely, workload, the exposure to potential infectious substance and conducting aerosol generated performance were not significantly related to the anxiety of FDS. As the model indicated, an elder age and PM-3 protective measures could lower the anxiety state of FDS, whereas the conflict with patients or/and colleagues would worsen it. Conclusions: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDS were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public.

While data on safety is increasingly available, evidence for efficacy is still sparse.

In particular, patients with primary and secondary antibody deficiency might benefit from this approach. However, testing of neutralizing antibodies is limited to specialized biosafety level 3 laboratories and is a time- and labor-intense procedure. In this single center study of 206 COVID-19 convalescent patients, clinical data, results of commercially available ELISA testing of SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG and CIgA, and levels of neutralizing antibodies, determined by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT), were analyzed. At a medium time point of 58 days after symptom onset, only 12.6% of potential plasma donors showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies (PRNT50  1:320). Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression analysis revealed need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (odds ratio 6.87; p-value 0.0004) and fever (odds ratio 3.00; p-value 0.0001) as leading factors affecting levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors.

In 2013 US food and drug administration issued a warning against the pro-arrhythmogenic activity of this drug in the presence of pre-existing cardiac conditions, known QT prolongation or QT-prolonging drug use and electrolyte abnormalities.(1) A recent study collected data on over 12 million patients showing the risk of cardiac events with AZ was rare ~0.03%, and there was no increased risk when compared to amoxicillin.(1,2) Here we report a patient with no known cardiac comorbidities who developed torsades des pointes (TdP) after 2 days of initiating AZ. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old African American female with a history of acid reflux, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and dry cough for one day. On arrival, patient had a temperature of 99.5F, pulse 115 beats/min, respirations at 32 breaths/min, blood pressure 120/66 and saturating in the 80s on room air, with an unremarkable physical exam. She had leukocytosis at 12.8k, d-dimer 2.15. Computed tomography with angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed bibasilar opacities. She had normal sinus rhythm with a QTc of 393 on ECG at presentation. COVID test was negative;She was empirically treated for community-acquired pneumonia with IV ceftriaxone and IV AZ, with which patient had significant clinical improvement and oxygen requirement. However on day 2 of hospitalization, she developed an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure followed by a cardiac arrest secondary to TdP with successful resuscitation in 15 minutes. Magnesium was 1.9, potassium 3.8. In the absence of risk factors like, cardiac disease, arrhythmias, concomitant use of QT prolonging drugs, and significant electrolyte abnormality, this event was attributed to the use of azithromycin. Naranjo adverse drug reaction scale score was 6. While in the ICU, patient was managed with amiodarone, metoprolol, AZ was discontinued. She made marked recovery and was extubated within 3 days, transferred to the floor where no further arrhythmias were noted. She was subsequently discharged to rehab on a short course of amoxicillin-clavulanate, amiodarone, metoprolol, and close cardiology follow-up. DISCUSSION: AZ is a relatively safe drug compared to other macrolides, and reports of cardiac arrhythmias induced solely by this drug with no concomitant risk factors are extremely rare. The evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the association of AZ with cardiac events are conflicting (3), and further investigations are warranted to assess this association. CONCLUSIONS: This case serves to reiterate the association of potentially fatal arrhythmias induced by a commonly prescribed antibiotic. Although these events are rare, they should be on our radar in clinical practice. REFERENCE #1: Patel H, Calip GS, DiDomenico RJ, Schumock GT, Suda KJ, Lee TA.

Their process structure may not be known before their execution. One way to cope with this uncertainty is to defer decisions regarding the process structure until run time. In this paper, we consider the definition of the process structure as a planning problem. Our approach uses automated planning techniques to generate plans that define process models according to the current context. The generated plan model relies on a metamodel called METAKIP that represents the basic elements of KiPs. Our solution explores Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to generate plan models. This technique allows uncertainty representation by defining state transition probabilities, which gives us more flexibility than traditional approaches. We construct an MDP model and solve it with the help of the PRISM model-checker. The solution is evaluated by means of a proof of concept in the medical domain which reveals the feasibility of our approach.","output":"Automated Planning for Supporting Knowledge-Intensive Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents the design of a DL-framework to deliver anatomy teaching that provides a microfiche of the onsite anatomy learning experience during the mandated COVID-19 lockdown. First, using nominal-group technique, we identified the DL learning theories to be employed in blueprinting the DL-framework. Effectiveness of the designed DL-framework in anatomy teaching was demonstrated using the exemplar of the Head and Neck (H&N) course during COVID-19 lockdown, in the pre-clerkship curriculum at our medical school. The dissemination of the DL-framework in the anatomy course was informed by the Analyse, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate (ADDIE) model. The efficiency of the DL-framework was evaluated using the first two levels of Kirkpatrick's model. Versatility of the DL-framework was demonstrated by aligning its precepts with individual domains of key learning outcomes framework. The framework's blueprint was designed amalgamating principles of: Garrison's community inquiry, Siemens' connectivism and Harasim's online-collaborative-learning; and improved using Anderson's DL-model. Following the implementation of the DL-framework in the H&N course informed by ADDIE, the framework's efficiency was evaluated. In total, 70% students responded to the survey assessing perception toward DL (Kirkpatrick's Level: 1). Descriptive analysis of the survey results showed that the DL-framework was positively received by students and attested that students had an enriched learning experience, which promoted collaborative-learning and student-autonomy. For, Kirkpatrick's Level: 2 i.e., cognitive development, we compared the summative assessment performance in the H&N course across three cohort of students. The results show that the scores of the cohort, which experienced the course entirely through DL modality was statistically higher (P < 0.01) than both the other cohorts, indicating that shift to DL did not have an adverse effect on students' learning. Using Bourdieu's Theory of Practice, we showed that the DL-framework is an efficient pedagogical approach, pertinent for medical schools to adopt; and is versatile as it attests to the key domains of students' learning outcomes in the different learning outcomes framework. To our knowledge this is the first-study of its kind where a rationale and theory-guided approach has been availed not only to blueprint a DL framework, but also to implement it in the MBBS curriculum.","output":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Distance Learning Framework to Adapt to the Changing Landscape of Anatomy Instruction in Medical Education During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Proof-of-Concept Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether a generic posterior tibial neurostimulator was noninferior to Urgent PC in the treatment of nonneurogenic OAB, urgency urinary incontinence, and mixed urinary incontinence. Secondary outcomes include rates of starting and completing 3 months of maintenance therapy, treatment success after 3 months, and adverse events. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of women whose nonneurogenic OAB, urgency urinary incontinence, or mixed urinary incontinence was treated with either Urgent PC or a generic posterior tibial neurostimulator. Previous research shows a 55% treatment success rate for posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). To demonstrate noninferiority with a limit of 14% and 80% power, our analysis required 157 patients per group. RESULTS: We included 267 Urgent PC and 234 generic patients and excluded 51 patients from analysis. A per-protocol analysis demonstrated treatment success in 55.3% (121 of 219) of the Urgent PC and 48.6% (85 of 175) of the generic cohort (P = 0.187). An intention-to-treat analysis showed treatment success in 45.3% (121 of 267) of the Urgent PC and 36.3% (85 of 234) of the generic cohort (P = 0.690). There were no significant differences in rates of starting (82.2% vs 78.2%, P = 0.409) or completing (79.9% vs 70.9%, P = 0.129) 3 months of maintenance therapy, treatment success after 3 months (78.5% vs 73.8%, P = 0.485), and adverse events (0.37% vs 0.85%, P = 1.000) in the Urgent PC versus generic group, respectively.

Despite the increased demand for economic evidence to support resource allocation for scaled-up implementation of mental health services in these contexts, economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The proposed systematic review aims to synthesize findings on methods and outcomes of economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs in LMICs and appraise quality. METHODS: We will identify, select, and extract data from published economic evaluations of psychological interventions for CMDs conducted in LMICs. We will search bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EconLit, PsycINFO, Africa-Wide Information, Cochrane library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry), and the African Journals Online (AJOL) and Google Scholar platforms. Only full economic evaluations (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), Cost-Consequence Analysis (CCA), or Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)) of psychological treatments for CMDs (defined as depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders) conducted in LMICs will be included. There will be no restrictions based on date of publication, perspective, follow-up duration or sample size. Data extraction will be guided by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. RESULTS: The results presented will be examined using a narrative synthesis approach. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the Drummond & Jefferson checklist. CONCLUSION: The fledgling evidence base in this area provides an opportunity to promote improved economic evaluation methods in line with repeated calls for economic evidence alongside effectiveness evidence in these settings. A rigorously developed economic evaluation evidence base will support resource allocation decisions for scaled up implementation of psychological interventions in LMIC settings.

All glial types internalized the bacteria within phagolysosomes, and S. aureus-conjugated BioParticles could be tracked with subtle but significant differences in time-course of phagocytosis between glial types. Live bacteria could be isolated from all glia after 24 h in culture, and microglia, OECs and TgSCs exhibited better protection against intracellular S. aureus survival than astrocytes. All glial types responded to the bacteria by cytokine secretion. Overall, OECs secreted the lowest level of cytokines, suggesting that these cells, despite showing strong capacity for phagocytosis, have immunomodulatory functions that can be relevant for neural repair.","output":"Antimicrobial responses of peripheral and central nervous system glia against Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital transformation is considered a major change process that takes time and often meets employee resistance and avoidance The outbreak of COVID-19 forced educators and students to skip the gradual transformation and transfer all teaching activities online The present paper views this phenomenon as an 'extreme' case and a unique opportunity to gather real time data on how students respond to digital transformation with particular focus on student diversity with regard to the digital threshold Based on a mixed-data survey with students from a graduate master programme during the first three months of the lockdown, we aim at mapping students' online learning experiences in terms of adaptability, learning outcomes and learning climate The results are held against current exam performance in order to surface possible correlations between students' response to the online transition and their general study performance Our research hypothesis is that capturing and understanding initial experiences during the sudden transition to online teaching can be of particular value in rethinking university teaching in a digitized perspective Such experiences convey a response to an actual need for digitized modes of teaching and tap into the procedural knowledge domain We conclude by reflecting on the value of creating hybrid learning spaces that may respond to specific educational needs under changing conditions ? 2020 Academic Conferences Limited All rights reserved","output":"Towards hybrid learning in higher education in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections are common among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims which pose a public health risk of spread of respiratory infections. Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir.

We find that some teleworkers earn a wage premium, but it varies by gender, parental status, and teleworking intensity. Fathers who telework earn more than fathers in office-based jobs, regardless of teleworking intensity. Women without children who telework occasionally earn more than their office counterparts. In industries and occupations where telework is more prevalent, mothers who work from home most days of the week pay a wage penalty compared to mothers in office-based jobs. Using time diaries, we find differences in work patterns and hours across worker groups that could drive these teleworker wage differentials. Most teleworkers work less on home days; however, those who earn wage premiums are working longer hours on weekdays, regardless of their work location. When teleworking, mothers experience more interruptions in their workdays than other workers, which could have negative effects on their productivity. We also find that teleworkers spend less time on commuting and grooming activities but more time on leisure activities and with family on work-at-home days than on office days, and female teleworkers spend more time sleeping and on household production activities.","output":"Telework, Wages, and Time Use in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Depression is one of the major causes for sick leave and loss of productivity at work. Many studies have investigated return to work (RTW) interventions for people with common mental disorders. However, a paucity of studies has targeted depressive symptoms in the workplace, as well as work productivity. Objectives This study presents preliminary results on a novel group intervention based on cognitive behavioral principles in order to optimize sustainable RTW, by reducing clinical symptoms (anxiety and depression) and improving work productivity. Method This pilot study followed a quasi-experimental design, with participants randomly receiving the group intervention (N = 19) or only receiving usual services (N = 11, control group). The group intervention called Healthy Minds for Sustainable RTW consists of eight sessions based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles and techniques. Outcome measures on depressive and anxiety symptoms and work productivity were administered at baseline (i.e. the start of return-to-work or gradual RTW), as well 2 months later (post-intervention), and at 6-month follow-up. Results The results did not show a time  group interaction for symptoms of depression or anxiety (p = 0.07). Those who received the group intervention however did see a within-group reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms over time, clinically significant for the group intervention only. A significant time  group interaction for work productivity was found, with those in the intervention group improving over time compared to the control condition.

Screen time, one of the most documented reasons for the obesogenic environment, enhances childhood obesity, since advertisements for unhealthy food products are still broadcast on channels for children. This is presently one of the main challenges for the government in Spain, since the current laws and obligations are not updated. This study aims to analyze food advertising aimed at children on Spanish television in 2013 and 2018 on childrens and general channels to test the effect of laws and obligations over time. In total, we viewed 512 h of the most viewed channels, two childrens and two general channels, during the week and on weekends during specific periods of 2013 and 2018. Food advertising was categorized as core, non-core, and other food advertisement (CFA, NCFA, and OFA, respectively) according to the nutritional profile. A total of 2935 adverts were analyzed, 1263 in 2013 and 1672 in 2018. A higher proportion of NCFAs were broadcast on childrens channels than in prior years, rising from 52.2% to 69.8% (p < 0.001). Nowadays, the risk of watching NCFAs on childrens channels compared to general channels turns out to be higher (Odds ratio > 2.5; p < 0.001), due to exposure to adverts for high-sugar and high-fat foods such as cakes, muffins, cookies, and fried and frozen meals rich in fat. In conclusion, the trends of nutritional profiles in food advertising on television are worsening over time, since the prevalence of NCFAs was higher in 2018 than in 2013. Currently, CFAs are not mainly broadcast on childrens channels, confirming high-risk exposure to non-core food advertising by watching them. Thus, food advertising laws and obligations should be adapted to increase compliance.","output":"The Nutritional Profile of Food Advertising for School-Aged Children via Television: A Longitudinal Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

From a nutritional point of view, the production of milk with a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially of those from the n3 group, is desirable because consumption of a diet with a lower n6/n3 ratio is considered to be beneficial for humans. The most effective way to achieve this goal is via dietary manipulations in ruminants. In addition to the feedstuffs commonly used in dairy animal nutrition, there are some alternative or unconventional feedstuffs that are often used for other purposes, e.g., for the reduction of methane production in the rumen. However, such feedstuffs can also alter the fatty acid profile of milk, and thus they can have an impact on the health properties of milk fat. ABSTRACT: Milk fat is an important nutritional compound in the human diet. From the health point of view, some fatty acids (FAs), particularly long-chain PUFAs such as EPA and DHA, have been at the forefront of interest due to their antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties, which play a positive role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as well as linoleic and -linolenic acids, which play an important role in CVD treatment as essential components of phospholipids in the mitochondria of cell membranes. Thus, the modification of the FA profileespecially an increase in the concentration of polyunsaturated FAs and n-3 FAs in bovine milk fatis desirable. The most effective way to achieve this goal is via dietary manipulations. The effects of various strategies in dairy nutrition have been thoroughly investigated; however, there are some alternative or unconventional feedstuffs that are often used for purposes other than basic feeding or modifying the fatty acid profiles of milk, such as tanniferous plants, herbs and spices, and algae. The use of these foods in dairy diets and their effects on milk fatty acid profile are reviewed in this article. The contents of selected individual FAs (atherogenic, rumenic, linoleic, -linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) and their combinations; the contents of n3 and n6 FAs; n6/n3 ratios; and atherogenic, health-promoting and S/P indices were used as criteria for assessing the effect of these feeds on the health properties of milk fat.","output":"Alternative and Unconventional Feeds in Dairy Diets and Their Effect on Fatty Acid Profile and Health Properties of Milk Fat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bile acids, the main organic solutes in bile, have been established to play an important role at physiological concentrations in gastrointestinal metabolism.

RESULTS: Out of 73 patients, data of 50 were analyzed. Twenty-five received tofacitinib and the other 25 were managed with standard of care. Age, comorbidities, and gender distribution between the two groups were similar. On day 7 of admission, the change in SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 1.26  1 and 0.72  1 in the tofacitinib group and control group, respectively. Similarly, a higher number of subjects in the control group showed worsening in the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale (36 vs 12%, p = 0.01). The clinical objective improvement was similar in the two groups. The intubation rates in the tofacitinib group were significantly lower than that in the control group (32% vs 8%, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib, in this retrospective single-center experience, was found to be associated with reduced intubation rates and reduced worsening in the WHO ordinal scale. There was no difference in mortality in the two groups. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Singh PK, Lalwani LK, Govindagoudar MB, Aggarwal R, Chaudhry D, Kumar P, et al.

Here, we analyse, quantify and compare viral adaptation in genomic sequence data derived from seven zoonotic events in the Coronaviridae family among primary, intermediate and human hosts. Rates of nonsynonymous (dN ) and synonymous (dS ) changes on specific amino acid positions were quantified for each open reading frame (ORF). Purifying selection accounted for 77% of all sites under selection. Diversifying selection was most frequently observed in viruses infecting the primary hosts of each virus and predominantly occurred in the orf1ab genomic region. Within all four intermediate hosts, diversifying selection on the spike gene was observed either solitarily or in combination with orf1ab and other genes. Consistent with previous evidence, pervasive diversifying selection on coronavirus spike genes corroborates the role this protein plays in host cellular entry, adaptation to new hosts and evasion of host cellular immune responses. Structural modelling of spike proteins identified a significantly higher proportion of sites for SARS-CoV-2 under positive selection in close proximity to sites of glycosylation relative to the other coronaviruses. Among human coronaviruses, there was a significant inverse correlation between the number of sites under positive selection and the estimated years since the virus was introduced into the human population. Abundant diversifying selection observed in SARS-CoV-2 suggests the virus remains in the adaptive phase of the host switch, typical of recent host switches.

However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW). Unlike predecessors, method optimization of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads. This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering the molecular weight cut-off did not improve our limit of detection and quantification (approximately 10(0) copies/L for all genes). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E -gene fragments. This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (10(0) copies/L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical methods for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 might be substantial. dPCR results in IWW were in line with the results found with qPCR. On average, the N2-gene fragment showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene fragment proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene fragment and showed higher variability.

The infrared absorption spectra are analyzed using the principal component analysis method to identify the key characteristic differences between infected and control samples. The SEIRA-based biosensor demonstrates rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, completing the detection of 1 M viral nucleic acids within less than 5 min without any amplification. When combined with the recombinase polymerase amplification treatment, the detection capability of 2.98 copies per L (5 aM) can be completed within 30 min.

METHODS: In this prospective multicentre randomised wait-list controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02771028), eligible cancer survivors had completed curative treatment, were 18 years or older and screened positive for sr-CRCI with  43 on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). Participants were randomised to the immediate treatment group (ITG) or wait-list control (WLC) group, based on age (< or  65 years), gender, treatment (chemotherapy or not), and centre. The ITG started to apply EFT after inclusion and performed this for 16 weeks. The WLC group could only start the application of EFT after 8 weeks of waiting. Evaluations took place at baseline (T0), 8 weeks (T1) and 16 weeks (T2). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with sr-CRCI according to the CFQ score. FINDINGS: Between October 2016 and March 2020, 121 patients were recruited with CFQ  43 indicating sr-CRCI. At T1, the number of patients scoring positive on the CFQ was significantly reduced in the ITG compared to the WLC group (40.8% vs. 87.3% respectively; p<0.01). For the WLC group, a reduction in CFQ scores was observed at T2, comparable to the effect of the ITG at T1. Linear mixed model analyses indicated a statistically significant reduction in the CFQ score, distress, depressive symptoms, fatigue and also an improvement in quality of life.

However, recently virus variants have emerged that can evade the immunity in a host achieved through vaccination. Consequently, new therapeutic agents that can efficiently prevent infection from these new variants, and hence COVID-19 spread are urgently required. To achieve this, extensive characterization of virus-host cell interactions to identify effective therapeutic targets is warranted. Here, we report a cell surface entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 that exists in a cell type-dependent manner is TMPRSS2-independent but sensitive to various broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors such as marimastat and prinomastat. Experiments with selective metalloproteinase inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs revealed that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is partially involved in the metalloproteinase pathway. Consistent with our finding that the pathway is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, both the furin cleavage motif in the S1/S2 boundary and the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are essential for metalloproteinase-dependent entry. In contrast, the two elements of SARS-CoV-2 independently contributed to TMPRSS2-dependent S2 priming. The metalloproteinase pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation and cytopathicity, leading us to theorize that it is also involved in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Thus, targeting the metalloproteinase pathway in addition to the TMPRSS2 and endosome pathways could be an effective strategy by which to cure COVID-19 in the future. Author Summary To develop effective therapeutics against COVID-19, it is necessary to elucidate in detail the infection mechanism of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, including recently emerging variants. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2 via the Spike protein, and then the Spike protein is cleaved by host proteases to enable entry. Selection of target cells by expression of these tissue-specific proteases contributes to pathogenesis. Here, we found that the metalloproteinase-mediated pathway is important for SARS-CoV-2 infection, variants included. This pathway requires both the prior cleavage of Spike into two domains and a specific sequence in the second domain S2, conditions met by SARS-CoV-2 but lacking in the related human coronavirus SARS-CoV. The contribution of several proteases, including metalloproteinases, to SARS-CoV-2 infection was cell type dependent, especially in cells derived from kidney, ovary, and endometrium, in which SARS-CoV-2 infection was metalloproteinase-dependent. In these cells, inhibition of metalloproteinases by treatment with marimastat or prinomastat, whose safety was previously confirmed in clinical trials, was important in preventing cell death. Our study provides new insights into the complex pathogenesis unique to COVID-19 and relevant to the development of effective therapies.","output":"Metalloproteinase-dependent and TMPRSS2-independnt cell surface entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 requires the furin-cleavage site and the S2 domain of spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study assesses the daily percentage of floor and intensive care unit bed available at in-network hospitals for patients with COVID-19 in Tennessee.","output":"Access to In-Network Hospitals in Tennessee During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic and the move to teletherapy has created uncertainty among both clinicians and patients As therapists who work with children, we have heard from parents who are desperate for support and advice about how to respond to their childrens behavioral changes, as well as those who feel too overwhelmed to continue their childrens sessions at the moment and want to take a break from treatment We have had to rethink the frame in concrete ways, reimagine how to play, and renegotiate parameters around confidentiality At a time when fear and uncertainty make mentalizing difficult, the hallmarks of a mentalizing approachcuriosity and flexibilityare most critical This paper will describe how the Mentalization-Based Treatment for Children (MBT-C) model offers a framework for an integrative approach that can inform treatment via teletherapy, so that clinicians can continue supporting young people and their families through this period We will begin by describing how the mentalizing stance, particularly an awareness of our own mentalizing capacities in the moment, has become more important than ever Ways in which clinicians maintain their mentalizing in the face of the mentalizing breakdowns will be also discussed Finally, we illustrate with clinical vignettes how the developmental levels of mentalizingattention control, emotion regulation, and explicit mentalizingcan inform the structure, techniques and interventions in teletherapy with children and parents","output":"Containing the Anxieties of Children, Parents and Families from a Distance During the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We offer an efficient mathematical model for forecasting the course of an emerging epidemic, with COVID-19 as a use case.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed in the aforementioned tissues. However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that the complement system was one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells. Infection of respiratory epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 generated activated complement component C3a and could be blocked by a cell-permeable inhibitor of complement factor B (CFBi), indicating the presence of an inducible cell-intrinsic C3 convertase in respiratory epithelial cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the interferon-JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system and NF-B as the main drivers of their expression. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, normalized interferon signature genes and all complement gene transcripts induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cell lines, but did not affect NF-B-regulated genes. Ruxolitinib, alone or in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, inhibited C3a protein produced by infected cells. Together, we postulate that combination therapy with JAK inhibitors and drugs that normalize NF-B-signaling could potentially have clinical application for severe COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 drives JAK1/2-dependent local complement hyperactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A real-time quantitative (q)RT-PCR employing consensus degenerate PCR primers was developed to detect all six genotypes known currently to comprise the yellow head virus (YHV) complex and found commonly in Penaeus monodon shrimp.

Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.","output":"Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To study the spectrum of chest dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging findings in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) or COVID-19 infected Indian patients and classify them on the basis of the Radiological Society of North America CT classification. Method A total of 110 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients (subjects) in which noncontrast chest DECT was done in our COVID-19 care center (CCC) were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of various abnormalities of lung parenchyma due to SARS-COV-2 and their distribution with extent was recorded. Various types of lung parenchyma abnormalities due to COVID-19 were evaluated in all patients. Data were analyzed and various prevalent abnormalities were calculated as a percentage for each type. All the cases were also sorted into four major groups on the basis of the Radiological Society of North America CT classification of COVID patients. Result Among the total 110 patients that were enrolled in this study, 80 (72.7%) were males and 30 (27.3%) were females with a mean age of 40.5  7 years (range 24-84). Out of this, we observed that 59 (53.6%) cases had abnormalities of lung parenchyma and were designated as DECT positive, whereas 51 (46.3%) cases had completely normal DECT. Only 14 (12.7%) of the patients (cases) presented with dyspnoea, 10 (9%) had hyperpnoea, whereas 12 (10.8%) had other associated comorbidities. Among the patients having abnormal DECT findings, multilobar (86%), bilateral lung field involvement (72.8%) with the ascendancy of peripheral and posterior distribution was most commonly noted. With respect to the different types of opacities noted in various patients, we found that ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the common abnormality found in almost all cases for the greatest part. Pure GGO was reported in 16 (28%), GGO admixed with a crazy-paving pattern were elicited in 17 (28.8%) and GGO mixed with consolidation was noted in 25 (42.3%) cases. Thirty-eight (64.4%) cases were having peri-lesional or intra-lesional segments or involving a small segment enlargement of the pulmonary vessel. Among the cases showing DECT positivity, the typical pattern on the basis of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) classification was noted in 71.2% of cases, whereas the atypical pattern was found in 1.2% percent of cases and the intermediate type was depicted in 25.4% percent of cases. Forty-six point three percent (46.3%) of the total cases that were enrolled in the study were grouped as the no pneumonia category. Conclusion The result of this study proved that the maximum number of RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients had mild symptoms and few comorbidities with normal chest DECT and fell under the no pneumonia category of the RSNA CT classification of COVID patients. However, out of the remaining patients, the majority of patients had GGO on DECT as a typical finding mixed with other patterns in a bilateral distribution and peripheral predominance. A preponderance of patients presented with the typical appearance of pneumonia followed by an intermediate type.","output":"Spectrum of Chest Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Findings in COVID Patients in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1COVID-19 has caused tremendous death and suffering since it first emerged in 2019.

Nsp5 from several coronaviruses have also been found to cleave host proteins, disrupting molecular pathways involved in innate immunity. Nsp5 from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with and can cleave human proteins, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Based on the continuing global pandemic, and emerging understanding of coronavirus Nsp5-human protein interactions, we set out to predict what human proteins are cleaved by the coronavirus Nsp5 protease using a bioinformatics approach. RESULTS: Using a previously developed neural network trained on coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage sites (NetCorona), we made predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in all human proteins. Structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then examined, generating a list of 92 human proteins with a highly predicted and accessible cleavage site. Of those, 48 are expected to be found in the same cellular compartment as Nsp5. Analysis of this targeted list of proteins revealed molecular pathways susceptible to Nsp5 cleavage and therefore relevant to coronavirus infection, including pathways involved in mRNA processing, cytokine response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study combines predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins with protein structure information and protein network analysis. We predicted cleavage sites in proteins recently shown to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, and we discuss how other potentially cleaved proteins may be relevant to coronavirus mediated immune dysregulation. The data presented here will assist in the design of more targeted experiments, to determine the role of coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage of host proteins, which is relevant to understanding the molecular pathology of coronavirus infection.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, sensorimotor and executive function performance was examined in a group of children (n = 40; 8C12 years), adolescents (n = 39; 13C17 years), and young adults (n = 83; 18C24 years) to investigate maturation of these functions, and how the relationships between these functions differ between groups. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents outperformed children on all sensorimotor and executive functions. Adults and adolescents exhibited similar levels of executive functioning, but adults outperformed adolescents on two sensorimotor functioning measures (eye-hand coordination spatial precision and proprioceptive variability). Regression analysis demonstrated that executive functions contribute to childrens sensorimotor performance, but do not contribute to adolescents sensorimotor performance. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the key role that developmental stage plays in the relationship between sensorimotor and executive functions. Specifically, executive functions appear to contribute to more successful sensorimotor function performance in childhood, but not during adolescence. It is likely that sensorimotor functions begin to develop independently from executive functions during adolescence, and therefore do not contribute to successful sensorimotor performance.

This supralinear synaptic integration is subject to modulation by inhibition. However, the specific rules by which different subtypes of interneurons affect the modulation have remained largely elusive. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of two subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Optogenetic activation of SST interneurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the supralinear response without affecting its threshold. PV interneuron activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on the supralinear response. Taken together, these results delineate the roles for SST and PV neurons in active synaptic integration. Differential effects of inhibition by SST and PV interneurons likely increase the computational capacity of the pyramidal neurons in modulating the nonlinear integration of synaptic output.Significance StatementThe principal function of neurons is to integrate a barrage of synaptic inputs and convert them into spike output. Such integration of inputs in the sensory neocortex ensures the transformation of environmental stimuli into a meaningful perception of the outside world. Synaptic integration in neuronal dendrites is shaped by passive electrical properties, active voltage-gated mechanisms, and inhibition from interneurons. Our results show that two genetically distinct subtypes of interneurons exert different types of inhibitory influence on active dendritic integration. Subtype-specific inhibitory influences provide a modulatory repertoire for the single cell computations that occur during synaptic integration.","output":"The impact of SST and PV interneurons on nonlinear synaptic integration in the neocortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the educational landscape worldwide. One year after the disease outbreak, blended learning, which combines distance and face-to-face learning, became an alternative to fully online learning to address the demands of ensuring students health and education. Physical education teachers faced an additional challenge, given the experiential nature of their subject, but research on teachers perspectives is scarce. This study aims to explore high school physical education teachers perceptions of the potential, advantages, and disadvantages of the blended learning model of instruction. An online survey was used to register the views of 174 Spanish high school physical education teachers (120 men and 54 women). The main findings revealed that physical education teachers considered that blended learning, compared with full face-to-face learning, implied a work overload, worsened social relationships, and did not help to increase students motivation. Likewise, most teachers considered the physical activity performed by students during the blended learning period as being lower than usual. Furthermore, teachers reported that the students from lower-income families were the ones that experienced a lack of technological means the most. These results may guide both present and future policies and procedures for blended physical education.

METHOD: The audit aim was to assess the impact of guideline change on clinical outcomes and readmission rate for acute cholecystitis. The revised Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (AUGIS) guidelines were the gold standard. All inpatient admissions for acute cholecystitis during the 4-week peak of the pandemic (17/04/2020 C 14/05/2020) were included.

RESULTS We enrolled 59 out of 90 patients (65%) that were identified and considered eligible during a 5-month period (target enrollment 60 patients over 12 months). The median patient age was 7 years (interquartile range 4-9 years), 61% (N = 36) were male, and 92% (N = 54) were African American. Quality DNA collection was successful for all 59 patients. The ED provider survey response rate was 100%. Most ED providers reported that the study did not impact their workflow (98% of physicians, 88% of nurses, and 90% of respiratory therapists). ED providers did report difficulties with spirometry in the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacogenomic studies can be conducted in the ED setting, and enroll a younger patient population with a high proportion of minority participants. By disseminating this study's methods and feasibility analysis, we aim to increase interest in pharmacogenomic studies set in the ED and aimed toward future ED-based pharmacogenomic decision-making.","output":"Methods and implementation of a pediatric asthma pharmacogenomic study in the emergency department setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repurposed drugs that are safe and immediately available constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we evaluate the success of prophylactic treatment with different drug types to prevent viral infection. We find that there exists a critical efficacy that a treatment must reach in order to block viral establishment. Treatment by a combination of drugs reduces the critical efficacy, most effectively by the combination of a drug blocking viral entry into cells and a drug increasing viral clearance. Below the critical efficacy, the risk of infection can nonetheless be reduced. Drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance reduce the risk of infection more than drugs that reduce viral production in infected cells. The larger the initial inoculum of infectious virus, the less likely is prevention of an infection. In our model, we find that as long as the viral inoculum is smaller than 10 infectious virus particles, viral infection can be prevented almost certainly with drugs of 90% efficacy (or more). Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. The largest delay of viral infection is achieved by drugs reducing viral production in infected cells. A delay of virus infection flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","output":"Success of prophylactic antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2: Predicted critical efficacies and impact of different drug-specific mechanisms of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Despite studies showing that repeated cannabis use may worsen depressive symptoms, the popular media increasingly presents cannabis as beneficial to mental health, and many members of the public view cannabis as beneficial for depression. Therefore, cannabis use among individuals with depression may be becoming more prevalent. Objective: To examine the association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults and the time trends for this association from 2005 to 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study used data from 16a?216 adults aged 20 to 59 years who were surveyed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national, annual, cross-sectional survey in the United States, between 2005 and 2016. Data analysis was conducted from January to February 2020. Exposures: Survey year and depression, as indicated by a score of at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any past-month cannabis use (ie, &#8805;1 use in the past 30 days) and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use (ie, &#8805;20 uses in the past 30 days). Logistic regression was used to examine time trends in the prevalence of cannabis use, depression, and the association between cannabis use and depression from 2005 to 2016. Results: The final analysis included 16a?216 adults, of whom 7768 (weighted percentage, 48.9%) were men, 6809 (weighted percentage, 66.4%) were non-Hispanic White participants, and 9494 (weighted percentage, 65.6%) had at least some college education. They had a weighted mean age of 39.12 (95% CI, 38.23-39.40) years. Individuals with depression had 1.90 (95% CI, 1.62-2.24) times the odds of any past-month cannabis use and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.80-2.92) times the odds of daily or near-daily cannabis use compared with those without depression. The association between cannabis use and depression increased significantly from 2005 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and any past-month cannabis use increased from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.07-1.99) in 2005 to 2006 to 2.30 (95% CI, 1.82-2.91) in 2015 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use increased from 1.37 (95% CI, 0.81-2.32) in 2005 to 2006 to 3.16 (95% CI, 2.23-4.48) in 2015 to 2016. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study indicate that individuals with depression are at increasing risk of cannabis use, with a particularly strong increase in daily or near-daily cannabis use. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and the evidence that cannabis does not treat depression effectively when discussing cannabis use with patients.","output":"Association of Depression With Past-Month Cannabis Use Among US Adults Aged 20 to 59 Years, 2005 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged &#8805; 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18-30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown.

This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identified compounds with broad 3CLpro-inhibitory activity. We also adapted the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncovered additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CLpro inhibitors. We observed strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live-virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identified two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested, including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last 2 decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We developed and validated a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identified compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncovered structural insights into features that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.","output":"Inhibitors of Coronavirus 3CL Proteases Protect Cells from Protease-Mediated Cytotoxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adequate swab specimen collection, release and detection of nucleic acids by molecular diagnostic assays is largely attributed to the physical and chemical characteristics of different swab types.

Ltd, China) used in clinical diagnostics with the aim to establish if different swab designs and configurations had any effect on swab performance. Properties investigated included viral absorption, release, capture, extraction and recovery efficiency from each swab for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). All swab types (n=18) were inoculated with different amounts of SARS-CoV-2 live viral cultures (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 copies/ml) and eluted in sterile phosphate buffer saline. RNA was extracted from all swab eluates using a fully automated system (BD MAX System) and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. RNA stability was also investigated after dry storage of swabs at room temperature for 72 hours. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in the absorption and release capabilities between Type 1 and 3 as well as between Type 2 and 3 swabs, however, no significant difference was observed between Type 1 and 2. Ct values and extraction efficiency amounts of SARS-CoV-2 varied amongst the swab types.

In this paper, we use a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive framework to study the effects of the pandemic on prices, unemployment rates, and interest rates in nine countries that took distinctive approaches in tackling the pandemic, where we introduce lockdowns as shocks to unemployment. Based on impulse response functions, we find that in most countries the unemployment rate rose, interest rates fell or turned negative, and prices fell initially following the implementation of the lockdown measures. However, the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus packages to counteract the effects of the pandemic reversed some of the effects on the variables, suggesting that models with explicit recognition of such effects should be developed.","output":"The COVID-19 Shock: A Bayesian Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper I explore several issues related to how the COVID\\\\19 pandemic might impact consumer demand for food.

Although nurses are indispensable healthcare professionals, programs to develop nurses with global health competencies and relevant studies are rare. Accordingly, this study was designed to develop a program to increase global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students and test its effect. Methods: A single group pre- and post-test study design was used. A 13-weeks program was developed and implemented with 204 students. Data were analyzed using paired t-test. The program to promote global health competencies was designed to improve nursing students' knowledge of global health, global leadership, global health competencies, critical thinking ability, and student-student partnership. Results: Global health competencies (t = ?19.96, p < 0.001), self-assessed global leadership (t = ?7.67, p < 0.001), and critical thinking ability (t = ?7.67, p < 0.001) all significantly increased. Discussion: The study findings of increased global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students after participation in the program indicated ways in which global health competencies of nurses need to be developed. Therefore, the following aspects should be considered. First, nursing educators should understand the need and importance of global health education and accordingly, current nursing curriculums should be revised to include courses about global health. A systematic course of studies about global health should be developed and implemented based on discussions among experts and researchers. Second, as future health care professionals, nursing students should take an interest in global health problems and recognize various issues that need to be solved beyond borders between countries.

In addition, case managers have been on the front lines of the response across the health care spectrum to reduce risks of contagion, including among health care workers. The purpose of this article is to discuss the case management response, highlighting the importance of individual care plans to provide access to the right care and treatment at the right time to address both the consequences of the disease and patient comorbidities. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS The COVID-19 response spans the full continuum of health and human services, including acute care, subacute care, workers' compensation (especially catastrophic case management), home health, primary care, and community-based care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE From the earliest days of the pandemic, case managers have assumed an important role on the front lines of the medical response to COVID-19, ensuring that procedures are in place for managing a range of patients: those who were symptomatic but able to self-isolate and care for themselves at home; those who had serious symptoms and needed to be hospitalized; and those who were asymptomatic and needed to be educated about the importance of self-isolating. Across the care spectrum, individualized responses to the clinical and psychosocial needs of patients with COVID-19 in acute care, subacute care, home health, and other outpatient settings have been guided by the well-established case management process of screening, assessing, planning, implementing, following up, transitioning, and evaluating. In addition, professional case managers are guided by values such as advocacy, ensuring access to the right care and treatment at the right time; autonomy, respecting the right to self-determination; and justice, promoting fairness and equity in access to resources and treatment. The value of justice also addresses the sobering reality that people from racial and ethnic minority groups are at an increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. Going forward, case management will continue to play a major role in supporting patients with COVID-19, in both inpatient and outpatient settings, with telephonic follow-up and greater use of telehealth.","output":"Case Management on the Front Lines of COVID-19: The Importance of the Individualized Care Plan Across Care Settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a serious pathogen that causes high morbidity and substantial mortality.

PURPOSE: Our objectives are three-fold: (1) highlight compliance failures with standardized handoffs; (2) identify factors contributing to compliance failures; and (3) develop guidelines for sustainable handoff interventions and processes. METHODS: We used ethnographic data collection methods-general observations, handoff shadowing, and semi-structured clinician interviews-with 84 participants from OR, ICU, and telemedicine teams at a large academic medical center. We conducted thematic analysis supported by inductive and deductive coding using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework. RESULTS: Post-operative handoffs can be characterized into four phases: pre-transfer preparation, transfer and setup, report preparation and delivery, and post-transfer care. We identified compliance failures with standardized handoff protocols and associated risk factors within the OR-ICU work system including limited teamwork, absence of handoff-specific tools, and poor clinician buy-in. To improve handoffs, clinicians provided suggestions for developing collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated handoff tools and re-engineering the handoff process.

This issue has been most recently highlighted in the individual and systemic attitudes, beliefs, and responses towards the recent, ongoing crisis following the global surge of COVID-19. In this paper, we provide examples and discuss lessons gleaned from the public health response to this crisis, particularly in the areas and intersections of gender, individualism, and neoliberalism, and the parallels of these issues in sex education. We make an appeal for a collectivist and community-oriented approach to sex education, which would focus not only on prevention and protection, but on inequities, ethics, and care for others.","output":"How to Provide Sexual Education: Lessons from a Pandemic on Masculinity, Individualism, and the Neoliberal Agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT IMPACT: Understanding the longitudinal glucose changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform point-of-care guidelines and elucidate the viral hypothesis of diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Hyperglycemia has emerged as an important manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Whether clinically-detectable glycemic changes persist following SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. This work aims to characterize temporal patterns in glucose dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Electronic health records of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2, and negative history of Diabetes Mellitus prior to infection were extracted from the TriNetX database. 7,502 patients with at least one blood glucose value 2 years to 2 weeks before, 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after, and 2 weeks after to 1 year after COVID-19 diagnosis were used for analysis. Temporal patterns are characterized by training state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, including fuzzy short time-series clustering, k-means for longitudinal data, and spectral clustering. Clustering performance is evaluated using internal evaluation metrics of the Silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz score, and Davies Bouldin index. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Based on the success of prior clustering methods with random blood glucose measurements, we anticipate that the proposed time-series clustering algorithms will appropriately characterize temporal patterns of glycemic dysregulation. The best performing algorithm based on interval evaluation metrics will be selected for further analysis. Associations between blood glucose values and cluster membership will be evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and effect size will be calculated using unbiased Cohens d. Clinical phenotypes for each cluster will be characterized in terms of current diagnoses, prior medication use, pertinent laboratory tests, and vital signs. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: A clearer understanding of the longitudinal glucose changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection can elucidate clinically-detectable patterns of glycemic dysregulation, identify sub-phenotypes of patients who are more susceptive to glycemic dysregulation, and inform appropriate point-of-care guidelines.","output":"27337 Characterizing Temporal Patterns in Glucose Dysregulation Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a debilitating muscular dystrophy with a variable age of onset, severity, and progression. While there is still no cure for this disease, progress towards FSHD therapies has accelerated since the underlying mechanism of epigenetic derepression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene leading to skeletal muscle toxicity was identified. This has facilitated the rapid development of novel therapies to target DUX4 expression and downstream dysregulation that cause muscle degeneration. These discoveries and pre-clinical translational studies have opened new avenues for therapies that await evaluation in clinical trials. As the field anticipates more FSHD trials, the need has grown for more reliable and quantifiable outcome measures of muscle function, both for early phase and phase II and III trials. Advanced tools that facilitate longitudinal clinical assessment will greatly improve the potential of trials to identify therapeutics that successfully ameliorate disease progression or permit muscle functional recovery.

The spike protein expressed on the surface of this virus is highly glycosylated and plays an essential role during the process of infection. We conducted a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis of the N-glycosylation profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using signature ions-triggered electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) mass spectrometry. The patterns of N-glycosylation within the recombinant ectodomain and S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were characterized using this approach. Significant variations were observed in the distribution of glycan types as well as the specific individual glycans on the modification sites of the ectodomain and subunit proteins. The relative abundance of sialylated glycans in the S1 subunit compared to the full-length protein could indicate differences in the global structure and function of these two species. In addition, we compared N-glycan profiles of the recombinant spike proteins produced from different expression systems, including human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) insect cells.

How one starts with a question, formulates it into a hypothesis upon which a clinical trial is then built, is integrated with statistics and probability, such as determining the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when its actually true (type I error) and the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (type II error). There are a variety of tests for different types of data and the appropriate test must be chosen for which the sample data meet the assumptions. Correcting of the type I error in the presence of multiple testing is needed to control the error's inflation. Within diagnostic testing, identifying false positive and false negative patients is critical to understanding the performance of a test. These are utilized to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a test along with the test's negative predictive value and positive predictive value. These quantities, specifically sensitivity and specificity, are used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test using receiver operating characteristic curves.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) and the relationship of GIS with readmission to the hospital within 30 days in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were hospitalized in a specified pandemic hospital. Materials and Methods: Symptomatic patients diagnosed with rapid antibody positivity with real-time polymerase chain reaction and typical thorax computed tomography findings were included in this retrospective cohort observational study. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. Hospital-associated GIS were considered as experiencing at least one of the GIS such as gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation developing within72 h after hospital admission. Results: The mean age of the patients was 58  14.4 years and 60.7% were men. 82% of hospitalizations were a moderate and severe disease. 71.4% of patients without GIS had at least one of the GIS after hospitalization. As the severity of the disease increased, the frequency of the severity of gastrointestinal symptom increased. GIS bowel disorders were more prominent in patients with moderate and severe disease. Antibiotic and specific treatment (anti-Il-1, anti-Il-6) contributed to the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptom in SARS-CoV-2 inpatients. Conclusion: According to our observations of the second wave of the pandemic, the presence, frequency, and severity of gastrointestinal symptom in inpatient is associated with severity of lung disease and increased readmission rate after discharge.

We previously described von willebrand factor (VWF) and their high molecular weight multimers (HMWMs) as potential trigger of microthrombosis. OBJECTIVES: Investigate VWF activity with collagen-binding assay and ADAMTS13 in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study enrolled 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 37 suffering from a non-critical form and 40 with critical form. Plasma levels of VWF collagen-binding ability (VWF:CB) and ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13:Act) were measured in the first 48 hours following admission. VWF:CB was increased in critical (631% IQR [460C704]) patients compared to non-critical patients (259% [235C330], p < 0.005). VWF:CB was significantly associated (r = 0.564, p < 0.001) with HMWMs. Moreover, median ADAMTS13:Act was lower in critical (64.8 IU/dL IQR 50.0C77.7) than non-critical patients (85.0 IU/dL IQR 75.8C94.7, p < 0.001), even if no patients displayed majors deficits. VWF:Ag-to-ADAMTS13:Act ratio was highly associated with VWF:CB (r = 0.916, p < 0.001). Moreover, VWF:CB level was highly predictive of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality as shown by the ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.92, p < 0.0001) in which we identified a VWF:CB cut-off of 446% as providing the best predictor sensitivityCspecificity balance. We confirmed this cut-off thanks to a KaplanCMeier estimator analysis (log-rank p < 0.001) and a Cox-proportional Hazard model (HR = 49.1, 95% CI 1.81C1328.2, p = 0.021) adjusted on, BMI, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:CB levels could summarize both VWF increased levels and hyper-reactivity subsequent to ADAMTS13 overflow and, therefore, be a valuable and easy to perform clinical biomarker of microthrombosis and COVID-19 severity.","output":"Von Willebrand factor collagen-binding capacity predicts in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients: insight from VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio imbalance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Total thyroidectomy makes up the majority of all thyroidectomy cases.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number of COVID-19 swarmed in the scientific community and public media due to its simplicity in explaining an infectious disease dynamic. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 over time in Bangladesh and its districts using reported cases. Methods Adapted methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), which is a sequential Bayesian approach using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, have been used to estimate Rt. Findings As of July 21, the mean Rt is 1.32(0.98-1.70, 90% HDI), with a median of 1.16(0.99-1.34 90% HDI). The initial Rt of Bangladesh was 3, whereas the Rt on the day of imposing nation-wide lockdown was 1.47, at the end of lockdown phase 1 was 1.06, at the end of lockdown phase 2 was 1.33. Each phase of nation-wide lockdown has contributed to the decline of effective reproduction number (Rt) for Bangladesh by 28.44%, and 26.70%, respectively, implying moderate effectiveness of the epidemic response strategies. Interpretation and Conclusion The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. The Rt continued to fall below the threshold value one steadily from the beginning of July and sustained around 1. The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. As of July 21, the current estimate of Rt is 1.07(0.92-1.15: 90% HDI), meaning that an infected individual is spreading the virus to an average of one other, with 0.07 added chance of infecting a second individual. This whole research recommends two things- broader testing and careful calibration of measures to keep Rt a long way below the crucial threshold one.","output":"Estimation of Effective Reproduction Number for COVID-19 in Bangladesh and its districts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a general method for measuring complex variables on a continuous, interval spectrum by combining supervised deep learning with the Constructing Measures approach to faceted Rasch item response theory (IRT). We decompose the target construct, hate speech in our case, into multiple constituent components that are labeled as ordinal survey items. Those survey responses are transformed via IRT into a debiased, continuous outcome measure. Our method estimates the survey interpretation bias of the human labelers and eliminates that influence on the generated continuous measure. We further estimate the response quality of each labeler using faceted IRT, allowing responses from low-quality labelers to be removed. Our faceted Rasch scaling procedure integrates naturally with a multitask deep learning architecture for automated prediction on new data. The ratings on the theorized components of the target outcome are used as supervised, ordinal variables for the neural networks' internal concept learning. We test the use of an activation function (ordinal softmax) and loss function (ordinal cross-entropy) designed to exploit the structure of ordinal outcome variables. Our multitask architecture leads to a new form of model interpretation because each continuous prediction can be directly explained by the constituent components in the penultimate layer. We demonstrate this new method on a dataset of 50,000 social media comments sourced from YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit and labeled by 11,000 U.S.-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to measure a continuous spectrum from hate speech to counterspeech.

PURPOSE: To understand which aspects of the publics perception of government handling of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted engagement of protective behaviors among older adults, who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. METHODS: Participants were recruited from an ongoing biopsychosocial study on aging amongst community-dwelling older adults. There were two rounds of data collection, during the national lockdown and post-lockdown. The average length of follow-up was 5.88 months. N = 421 completed the first round of data collection and N = 318 subsequently completed the second round of questionnaires. RESULTS: During the lockdown, perceptions that pandemic-related measures in place were sufficient, effective, timely, provided a sense of safety, important information was easily accessible, and government handling of the pandemic could be trusted, were found to significantly predict engagement in protective behaviors. During post-lockdown, only perceptions that measures in place were sufficient, provided a sense of safety, and important information was easily accessible, remained significant predictors. The perception that COVID-19 measures were clear and easy to understand now became a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Public perceptions of government handling of the pandemic predicted engagement in protective behaviors but were less important during post-lockdown.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in massive amounts of international and national information and guidance. This guidance was often conflicting and not suited to New Zealand midwifery. AIM: To examine and map the national and international guidance and information provided to midwifery regarding COVID-19 and foreground learnt lessons for future similar crises. METHODS: A systematic scoping review informed by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. A range of sources from grey and empirical literature was identified and 257 sources included. FINDINGS: Four categories were identified and discussed: (1) guidance for provision of maternity care in the community; (2) guidance for provision of primary labour and birth care; (3) Guidance for midwifery care to women/wahine with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, including screening processes and management of neonates of infected women/wahine (4) Guidance for midwives on protecting self and own families and whanau (extended family) from COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSION: Guidance was mainly targeted and tailored for hospital-based services. This was at odds with the NZ context, where primary continuity of care underpins practice. It is evident that those providing continuity of care constantly needed to navigate an evolving situation to mitigate interruptions and restrictions to midwifery care, often without fully knowing the personal risk to themselves and their own families.

In the weighted cohort, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome (8.2% vs 8.0%; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91-1.16), secondary composite outcome, nor individual component outcomes between current PPI users and non-users. There was no significant interaction between age and PPI use on outcomes. Conclusion: Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, current PPI use vs non-use is not associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Proton pump inhibitor use is not associated with severe COVID-19 related outcomes: A propensity score weighted analysis of a national veteran cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to end-of-life decision-making and advance care planning. Advance directives (ADs) are documents that express an individual's wishes regarding their medical care if they are incapacitated and may appoint someone to make decisions for them. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the widely available state-approved AD documents provided to the public online. Their content was coded using a grounded theory approach, and the reading level of the documents was assessed. Preferences related to important issues, such as pain relief, were commonly included (92.2% of forms), but other issues, such as whether someone would approve of artificial respiration (39.2%) or CPR (35.3%), were less often addressed. The average reading level of the forms (M = grade 7.64; SD = 1.28) was above the recommended 5th grade level. Overall, there was meaningful variability in the comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of AD documents, suggesting incompatibility for those recording their end-of-life preferences across states and the need for future work to increase their user-friendliness and ability to record authentic advance care wishes.","output":"The comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of publicly-available, state-approved advance directive documents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer have worse clinical outcomes compared to those without cancer. Primary studies have examined this population, but most had small sample sizes and conflicting results. Prior meta-analyses exclude most US and European data or only examine mortality. The present meta-analysis evaluates the prevalence of several clinical outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19, including new emerging data from Europe and the US. Methods: A systematic search of PubMED, medRxiv, JMIR and Embase by two independent investigators included peer-reviewed papers and preprints up to July 8, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality. Other outcomes were ICU and non-ICU admission, mild, moderate and severe complications, ARDS, invasive ventilation, stable, and clinically improved rates. Study quality was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random effects model was used to derive prevalence rates, their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: Thirty-four studies (N = 4,371) were included in the analysis. The mortality prevalence rate was 25.2% (95% CI: 21.1-29.7;95% PI: 9.8-51.1;I2= 85.4), with 11.9% ICU admissions (95% CI: 9.2-15.4;95% PI: 4.3- 28.9;I2= 77.8) and 25.2% clinically stable (95% CI: 21.1-29.7;95% PI: 9.8-51.1;I2= 85.4). Furthermore, 42.5% developed severe complications (95% CI: 30.4-55.7;95% PI: 8.2- 85.9;I2= 94.3), with 22.7% developing ARDS (95% CI: 15.4-32.2;95% PI: 5.8-58.6;I2= 82.4), and 11.3% needing invasive ventilation (95% CI: 6.7-18.4;95% PI: 2.3-41.1;I2= 79.8). Post-follow up, 49% clinically improved (95% CI: 35.6-62.6;95% PI: 9.8-89.4;I2= 92.5). All outcomes had large I2 , suggesting high levels of heterogeneity among studies, and wide PIs indicating high variability within outcomes. Despite this variability, the mortality rate in cancer patients with COVID-19, even at the lower end of the PI (9.8%), is higher than the 2% mortality rate of the non-cancer with COVID-19 population, but not as high as what other meta-analyses conclude, which is around 25%. Conclusions: Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 have a higher probability of mortality compared to the general population with COVID-19, but possibly not as high as previous studies have shown. A large proportion of them developed severe complications, but a larger proportion recovered. Prevalence of mortality and other outcomes published in prior meta-analyses did not report prediction intervals, which compromises the clinical utilization of such results.","output":"Clinical outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and metaanalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Doctors are often been judged negatively as a consequence of high expectation and demand from their job and face violence at workplace. Continuous worry of facing aggression at workplace may seriously affect job satisfaction and intention to job turnover. However, the association between workplace safety and job satisfaction had not been studied earlier in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among doctors from November 2019 to April 2020 using a pre-tested, semi-structured, anonymous Google forms based questionnaire among doctors working in private and/or public healthcare settings across India. Perception of safety was assessed by scoring in a scale. Cronbach's coefficient of the scale was calculated to be 0.88. Job satisfaction was assessed using the 5-item Brayfield and Rothe measure of job satisfaction. Cronbach's coefficient of the scale was 0.76. The data was coded and analyzed with the help of STATA-12. RESULTS: 617 doctors practicing modern medicine participated in this study from all over India. 262 (42.5%) doctors were found to be satisfied at their job. Perception of safety at workplace was found to have 2.5 times greater influence on job satisfaction of doctors. 23.2% of the doctors expressed job turnover intention which was positively correlated with job satisfaction and perception of safety. CONCLUSION: Perception of safety from workplace violence was found to have significant effect on job satisfaction and turnover intention than actual violence.

To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1C64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove.

Cartilage, meniscus, and tendon tissue demonstrated 97%, 99%, and 96% reduction in DNA content after decellularization, respectively, and with effective decellularization confirmed visually via histology. High retentions of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen, and other proteins were observed in meniscus and tendon following decellularization. Results with manual decellularization with meniscus tissue were consistent with the automated decellularization process. Decellularized cartilage demonstrated a 34% decrease in GAG content while protein and collagen content did not significantly change.

In response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies, these vulnerabilities are being experienced in the context of adapted drug treatment service provision, including reduced in-person support and increased regulatory flexibility in opioid substitution therapy (OST) guidelines. This study aimed to explore the longer-term impact of the pandemic on the health and wellbeing of PWID in the UK, including provider and client experiences of treatment changes. Methods : Interviews were conducted with 19 PWID and 17 drug treatment providers between May C September 2021, recruited from drug and homelessness charities providing treatment services and healthcare in the UK. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results : Most participants expressed ongoing fears of COVID-19 transmission, although socio-structural inequalities limited the contexts in which physical distancing could be practised. In addition, virus mitigation strategies altered the risk environment for PWID, resulting in ongoing physical (e.g. changing drug use patterns, including transitions to crack cocaine, benzodiazepine and pregabalin use) and socio-economic harms (e.g. limited opportunities for sex work engagement and income generation). Finally, whilst clients reported some favourable experiences from service adaptations prompted by COVID-19, including increased regulatory flexibility in OST guidelines, there was continued scepticism and caution among providers toward sustaining any treatment changes beyond the pandemic period. Conclusions : Whilst our findings emphasize the importance of accessible harm reduction measures attending to changing indices of drug-related harm during this period, there is a need for additional structural supports to ensure pre-existing disparities and harms impacting PWID are not exacerbated further by the conditions of the pandemic. In addition, any sustained policy and service delivery adaptations prompted by COVID-19 will require further attention if they are to be acceptable to both service users and providers.","output":"A qualitative study exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) and drug service provision in the UK: PWID and service provider perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 associated with haematological manifestations (thrombolytic events).

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. METHOD: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200C1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19.

Moreover, we have used cell type-specific antigen targeting to define critical cells and molecules that sustain long-term antigen presentation and T cell activity after Adenovirus vector immunization in mice. While antigen targeting to myeloid cells was insufficient to activate antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, genetic activation of antigen expression in Ccl19-Cre-expressing fibroblastic stromal cells induced inflating CD8(+) T cells. Local ablation of vector-targeted cells revealed that lung fibroblasts support protective support protective function and metabolic fitness inflating memory T cells in an IL-33-dependent manner.

Multivariate Cox regression and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were both used to identify high-risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. The prediction model was developed based on four high-risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity [hazard ratio (HR) 3.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-5.11], albumin (ALB) level (HR 3.67, 95% CI 1.91-7.02), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.68-5.96), and age &#8805;60 years (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.43-3.73) were independent risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. OPLS-DA identified that the top five influencing parameters for COVID-19 severity were CRP, ALB, age &#8805;60 years, comorbidity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. When incorporating the above four factors, the nomogram had a good concordance index of 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) and had an optimal agreement between the predictive nomogram and the actual observation with a slope of 0.95 (R 2 = 0.89) in the 7-day prediction and 0.96 (R 2 = 0.92) in the 14-day prediction after 1,000 bootstrap sampling.

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented for solving a lot of real-world problems on machines based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, one dimension (1D) CNN is suggested and implemented to diagnose respiratory diseases of COVID-19 from human respiratory sounds such as a voice, cough, and breath. An augmentation-based mechanism is applied to improve the preprocessing performance of the COVID-19 sounds dataset and to automate COVID-19 disease diagnosis using the 1D convolutional network. Furthermore, a DDAE (Data De-noising Auto Encoder) technique is used to generate deep sound features such as the input function to the 1D CNN instead of adopting the standard input of MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient), and it is performed better accuracy and performance than previous models.","output":"Automatic COVID-19 disease diagnosis using 1D convolutional neural network and augmentation with human respiratory sound based on parameters: cough, breath, and voice (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing small\\\\scale soft continuum robots with large\\\\angle steering capacity and high\\\\precision manipulation offers broad opportunities in various biomedical settings.

The epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 should be analyzed in our country. The current study aims to evaluate the demographic features and clinical profile of COVID-19 patients ina Tertiary Care Hospital of Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan. Materials and Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted on 85 patients with positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) verified by nasopharyngeal swabs and throat at Covid 19 setup in Sheikh Zayed Hopsital, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan for period of six months i.e from September 2020 to February 2021. Institutional consensus protocol and COVID-19 SOPs were followed to investigate each individual. Various parameters such as symptom presentation, demographics' details, ventilator therapy and oxygen required, and co-morbidities were studied. Results: The mean age of the patients was 37.6 +/- 5.7 years with an age range of 15 to 81 years. Of the total 104 patients enrolled, 60 (58%)were male and 44 (42%). The prevalence of COVID-19 caused by contact was 67 (65%).Symptomatic patients out of enrolled were 49 (47.1%). In this study, a significant association was found between severe COVID-19 and parameters such ashypertension and diabetes history, and patients having age above 65 years. Out of 104 COVID-19 positive patients, symptomatic complaints were as follows;Cough 29(27.9%), fever 63 (60.6%), and breathe shortness 12 (11.5%). Tachypnea (RR>24), hypoxia and comorbid illness were found 32 (31%), 27 (25.8%), and 45 (43.2%)respectively. About 19 (18.2%) patients needed intensive care unit admission with 5 (4.8%) required immediate ventilation assistance. Mortality was 3.8% (4 patients) observed in this study. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic mortalityrate is higher among patients above 60 years of age and with comorbidities. The COVID-19 majority of patients presented in our hospital were of young or average age and asymptomatic. Respiratory symptoms were present in half and fever was recorded in more than half patients.

During two years of predominantly working from home, employees and managers alike formed expectations about what post-pandemic working life should look like. Many companies are currently experimenting with new work policies that balance both employee- and manager expectations to where, when and how work should be done in the future. In this article, we gather experiences from 17 companies and their sites, covering 12 countries. We share the results of corporate surveys of employee preferences for working from home and analyse new work policies. Our results are threefold. First, through the new work policies all companies are formally giving more flexibility to the employees with regards to working time and work location. Second, there is a great variation in how much flexibility the companies are willing to yield to the employees. The variation is related both to industry type, size of the companies, and company culture. Third, we document a change in the psychological contract between employees and managers, where the option of working from home is converted from an exclusive perk that managers could choose to give to the few, to a core privilege that all employees feel they are entitled to. Finally, there are indications that as the companies learn and solicit feedback regarding the efficiency of the chosen strategies, we might see further developments and changes of the work policies with respect to how much flexibility to work whenever and from anywhere they grant. Through these findings, the paper contributes to a growing literature about the new trends emerging from the pandemic in tech companies and spells out practical implications onwards.","output":"Work-From-Home is Here to Stay: Call for Flexibility in Post-Pandemic Work Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been great provision of open data across the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response, with, for example, dashboards presenting real-time descriptions of new daily cases and risk factors.

In this study, we developed a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the N gene to efficiently discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs in human clinical samples. Without compromising the sensitivity, this method significantly enhanced the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 100-fold as compared to conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we designed an RT-qPCR method for the sensitive and universal detection of ORF3ab-E genes of SARSr-CoV with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.3 RNA copies per microliter. Thus, the developed assay serves as a confirmative dual-target detection method. Our PNA-mediated dual-target RT-qPCR assay can detect clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples in the range of 18.10-35.19 Ct values with an 82.6-100% detection rate. Furthermore, our assay showed no cross-reactions with other coronaviruses such as human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza viruses (Type B, H1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5Nx, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (MPV, RSV A, RSV B, PIV, AdV, and HRV).

Fungi, particularly mushrooms, are the principal source of naturally occurring psychedelics. The mushroom extract, psilocybin has historically been used as a psychedelic agent for religious and spiritual ceremonies, as well as a therapeutic option for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelic use was largely associated with the hippie counterculture movement, which, in turn, resulted in a growing, and still lingering, negative stigmatization for psychedelics. As a result, in 1970, the U.S. government rescheduled psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs, ultimately ending scientific research on psychedelics. This prohibition on psychedelic drug research significantly delayed advances in medical knowledge on the therapeutic uses of agents such as psilocybin. A 2004 pilot study from the University of California, Los Angeles, exploring the potential of psilocybin treatment in patients with advanced-stage cancer managed to reignite interest and significantly renewed efforts in psilocybin research, heralding a new age in exploration for psychedelic therapy.

Stigma is likely to play a negative role in this regard and yet, no study has investigated the impact of stigma on depression and self-esteem of persons with disabilities. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted in June 2017 a random sample disability case control household study in Soweto, a township in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using propensity score analysis and structural equation modeling, we investigated the relationship between disability, stigma, depression and self-esteem controlling for socioeconomic covariates. Our main empirical results showed that stigma significantly mediates the association between disability and higher depression on the one hand and between disability and lower self-esteem on the other. This mediating effect exists even after controlling for age, gender, marital status, education, employment and wealth. We also found strong direct associations between disability and depressive mood, somatic indicators and negative feelings such as unhappiness and low self-esteem. Unemployment aggravates depression and low self-esteem while low education worsens self-esteem only. In addition, depression exacerbates low self-esteem. Both unemployment and low education are more common among persons with disabilities aggravating the disability, depression, poor self-esteem nexus. Similarly, persons with disabilities who are more likely to be depressed are also at higher risk of low self-esteem.These results point to a vicious reinforcing circle of exclusion from society, despair and self-deprecation, which could prove difficult to break.

This is based on the fact that POI lists are user generated content and can be considered as collections of related POIs. Our method attempts to extract these relations and express the notion of similarity using graph theoretic, set theoretic and statistical measures.

A low rating was obtained for engaging in other activities while driving the partially automated car (M = 2.27). Partial automation did, however, increase reported engagement in secondary tasks that are already performed during manual driving (i.e., the proportion of respondents reporting to observe the landscape, use the phone for texting, navigation, music selection and calls, and eat during partially automated driving was higher in comparison to manual driving). Unsafe behaviour was rare with 1% of respondents indicating to rarely monitor the road, and another 1% to sleep during partially automated driving. Structural equation modeling revealed a strong, positive relationship between perceived safety and trust ( = 0.69, p = 0.001). Performance expectancy had the strongest effects on automation use, followed by driver engagement, trust, and non-driving related task engagement. Perceived safety interacted with automation use through trust. We recommend future research to evaluate the development of perceived safety and trust in time, and revisit the influence of driver engagement and non-driving related task engagement, which emerged as new constructs related to trust in partial automation.","output":"Perceived safety and trust in SAE Level 2 partially automated cars: Results from an online questionnaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Severely ill patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop circulatory failure. We aimed to report patterns of left and right ventricular dysfunction in the first echocardiography following admission to intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive study that collected echocardiographic and clinical information from severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to 14 ICUs in 8 countries. Patients admitted to ICU who received at least one echocardiography between 1st February 2020 and 30th June 2021 were included. Clinical and echocardiographic data were uploaded using a secured web-based electronic database (REDCap). RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-seven patients were included and the first echo was performed 2 [1, 4] days after ICU admission. The median age was 65 [56, 73] years, and 71% were male. Left ventricle (LV) and/or right ventricle (RV) systolic dysfunction were found in 234 (34.5%) patients. 149 (22%) patients had LV systolic dysfunction (with or without RV dysfunction) without LV dilatation and no elevation in filling pressure. 152 (22.5%) had RV systolic dysfunction. In 517 patients with information on both paradoxical septal motion and quantitative RV size, 90 (17.4%) had acute cor pulmonale (ACP). ACP was associated with mechanical ventilation (OR > 4), pulmonary embolism (OR > 5) and increased PaCO(2). Exploratory analyses showed that patients with ACP and older age were more likely to die in hospital (including ICU). CONCLUSION: Almost one-third of this cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients exhibited abnormal LV and/or RV systolic function in their first echocardiography assessment. While LV systolic dysfunction appears similar to septic cardiomyopathy, RV systolic dysfunction was related to pressure overload due to positive pressure ventilation, hypercapnia and pulmonary embolism. ACP and age seemed to be associated with mortality in this cohort.

However, assessment of their effectiveness in COVID-19 patients is necessary before prioritizing them for further study. We attempted to shortlist the candidate drugs using an in-silico approach. First, we analysed two published transcriptomic data sets of COVID-19- and SARS-infected patients compared to healthy individuals to find the key pathways altered after infection. Then, using publicly available drug perturbational data sets in human cell lines from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP), we assessed the effects of the approved drugs on the altered pathways. We also used the available pharmacogenomic data sets from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) portal to assess the effects of the altered pathways on resistance or sensitivity to the drugs in human cell lines.

METHODS: Fifty-nine eyes with corneal dystrophy (26 eyes with GCD, 18 eyes with LCD and 15 eyes with MCD) and 48 eyes from healthy subjects were included in this study. All subjects received ocular examination and anterior segment photography under slit-lamp microscope. Corneal biomechanical parameters were obtained using CST. IOP and CCT were obtained using GAT and USP, respectively. Mixed-effects models were fitted for group comparisons and Bland-Altman analyses were applied for assessing the agreement of IOP or CCT between devices. RESULTS: GCD, LCD and MCD showed higher First Applanation Deformation Amplitude (A1DA) and Corvis Biomechanical Index (CBI), and a lower Stiffness Parameter at First Applanation (SPA1), compared to controls. After CCT adjustment, MCD group showed a higher A1DA compared to GCD or LCD. The IOP measured by CST demonstrated an overestimated bias to the one obtained by GAT in all groups.

A total of 503 men and women from the Spanish general population completed the survey. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data, fear of COVID-19, PTSS symptoms, and current psychological history were assessed. Prevalence of informal caregiving in the sample was 16.5%. Increased levels of fear and PTSS were found in caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Female gender and high number of COVID-19 related risk factors was also associated with fear and PTSS severity. The moderation analyses showed an interaction effect between caregiving and fear of COVID-19 when predicting PTSS symptoms. Particularly, results showed that informal caregivers reported greater PTSS symptoms, when compared to non-caregivers with same levels of fear of COVID-19.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. METHODS: A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second people's Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42( 10.99) and 45.23( 11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (p < 0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased.

The effective policy requires taking into account public information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c) transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments.

In our previous study, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces human nasopharyngeal commensal microbiome (bacteria, archaea and commensal respiratory viruses) but increases the abundance of pathobionts. This study aimed to assess the possible changes in the resident fungal diversity by the inclusion of opportunistic fungi due to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the NT of humans. Twenty-two (n = 22) nasopharyngeal swab samples (including COVID-19 = 8, Recovered = 7, and Healthy = 7) were collected for RNAseq-based metagenomics analyses. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) the population and diversity of NT fungi with a high inclusion of opportunistic pathogens. We detected 863 fungal species including 533, 445, and 188 species in COVID-19, Recovered, and Healthy individuals, respectively that indicate a distinct microbiome dysbiosis due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, 37% of the fungal species were exclusively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, where S. cerevisiae (88.62%) and Phaffia rhodozyma (10.30%) were two top abundant species in the NT of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, 16% commensal fungal species found in the Healthy control were not detected in either COVID-19 patients or when they were recovered from the COVID-19. Pairwise Spearmans correlation test showed that several altered metabolic pathways had significant positive correlations (r > 0.5, p < 0.01) with dominant fungal species detected in three metagenomes. Taken together, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant dysbiosis of fungal microbiome and alters some metabolic pathways and expression of genes in the NT of human. Findings of our study might be helpful for developing microbiome-based diagnostics, and also devising appropriate therapeutic regimens including antifungal drugs for prevention and control of concurrent fungal coinfections in COVID-19 patients. Author summary The SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic betacoronavirus that primarily enters into the human body through NT to cause fearsome COVID-19 disease. Recent high throughput sequencing and downstream bioinformatic analyses revealed that microbiome dysbiosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not limited to bacteria, and fungi are also implicated in COVID-19 development in susceptible individuals. This study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in remarkable depletion of NT commensal fungal microbiomes with inclusion of various opportunistic fungal pathogens. We discussed the role of these altered fungal microbiomes in the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that dysbiosis in fungal microbiomes and associated altered metabolic functional pathways (or genes) possibly play a determining role in the progression of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Thus, the identifiable changes in the diversity and composition of the NT fungal population and their related genomic features demonstrated in this study might lay a foundation for better understanding of the underlying mechanism of co-pathogenesis, and the ongoing development of therapeutic agents including antifungal drugs for the resolution of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Metagenomic analysis reveals the abundance and diversity of opportunistic fungal pathogens in the nasopharyngeal tract of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lean Management method has been applied in several fields before its implementation in healthcare area.

The decrease in CHPV infectivity to Neuro-2a cells was observed in the presence of recombinant vimentin or anti-vimentin antibody. Vimentin mRNA expression remains unaltered in CHPV infected Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted the residues in vimentin and CHPV glycoprotein (G); probably involved in cell-virus interactions. Overall, we conclude that surface vimentin in Neuro-2a cells interact with CHPV and facilitate the binding of CHPV to the cells; it could be acting as a co-receptor for the CHPV. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the exact role of vimentin in CHPV infection in neuronal cells.","output":"Role of cell surface vimentin in Chandipura virus replication in Neuro-2a cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between worry about COVID-19 infection in the workplace and while commuting to work and psychological distress in Japan.

Using high-throughput screening, nearly 20,000 \\"lead-like\\" compounds were tested for inhibitory activity against the NoV genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) RdRp. The four most potent hits demonstrated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between 5.0 M and 9.8 M against the target RdRp. Compounds NIC02 and NIC04 revealed a mixed mode of inhibition, while NIC10 and NIC12 were uncompetitive RdRp inhibitors. When examined using enzymes from related viruses, NIC02 demonstrated broad inhibitory activity while NIC04 was the most specific GII.4 RdRp inhibitor. The antiviral activity was examined using available NoV cell culture models; the GI.1 replicon and the infectious GV.1 murine norovirus (MNV). NIC02 and NIC04 inhibited the replication of the GI.1 replicon, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 30.1 M and 71.1 M, respectively, while NIC10 and NIC12 had no observable effect on the NoV GI.1 replicon. In the MNV model, NIC02 reduced plaque numbers, size, and viral RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (EC50s between 2.3 M and 4.8 M). The remaining three compounds also reduced MNV replication, although with higher EC50s, ranging from 32 M to 38 M.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the tele-triage system on urgent visit volume and explore the characteristics of acute visit requests at a tertiary referral eye center. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed acute visit requests between April 6, 2020 and June 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and bivariate logistic regression were used to compare variables with a p-value of 0.05. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-eight surveys were completed. Mean age was 49.7  18.8 years (range 2C91). The majority of requests were determined as urgent (63.0%) or emergent (0.8%). Forty-nine patients had recent eye trauma (13.7%), and the most common reported symptoms were new onset eye pain (25.7%) and photophobia (22.9%). Most patients were self-referred (63.7%), though provider referral was more common in patients with symptoms of new onset lid swelling (p < 0.01), diplopia (p < 0.01), flashing lights (p = 0.02), or droopy eyelid (p < 0.01). Patients presenting with symptom onset within 48 h tended to be younger (45.8 years) versus those with symptom duration of 48 h to 1 week (49.6 years), or more than 1 week (52.6 years; p < 0.01).

Structural and biophysical studies have recently characterized the conformational landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins in the prefusion form, revealing a spectrum of stable and more dynamic states. By employing molecular simulations and network modeling approaches, this study systematically examined functional dynamics and identified the regulatory centers of allosteric interactions for distinct functional states of the wild-type and mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike trimer. This study presents evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can function as an allosteric regulatory engine that fluctuates between dynamically distinct functional states. Perturbation-based modeling of the interaction networks revealed a key role of the cross-talk between the effector hotspots in the receptor binding domain and the fusion peptide proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results have shown that the allosteric hotspots of the interaction networks in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can control the dynamic switching between functional conformational states that are associated with virus entry to the host receptor. This study offers a useful and novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the lens of allosteric signaling as a regulatory apparatus of virus transmission that could open up opportunities for targeted allosteric drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 proteins and contribute to the rapid response to the current and potential future pandemic scenarios.","output":"Molecular Simulations and Network Modeling Reveal an Allosteric Signaling in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic challenged parental resources pertinent to coping with lockdowns.

For stent delivery, we used a 300-cm 0.014-in microguidewire (Transend), which was placed into the target branch using an exchange technique. A 0.027-in microcatheter (Excelsior XT-27), which was designed for the stent, was advanced over the exchange microguidewire. If we had trouble in advancing the microcatheter over the exchange microguidewire, we inserted a regular microguidewire (Traxcess), into the microcatheter lumen in a parallel fashion. We also analyzed the mechanism underlying microcatheter positioning failure and the success rate of the 'parallel-wire technique'.

Our results validate reports that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14Cnsp10 complex has RNase activity. Detailed functional characterization reveals nsp14Cnsp10 is a versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3-terminus.

We propose that the role of nsp14Cnsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading by purging the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication-terminating aberrations.

The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is not limited to the respiratory system but has widespread involvement including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver, with evidence of prolonged fecal shedding and feco-oral transmission. This finding has stirred up a hornets nest of not only a newer modality of the spread of the virus but also a risk of the unpredictable duration of the infective potential of the shedders. We reviewed the literature on fecal shedding and possible implications on prevention and surveillance strategies. The pandemic is changing the management of underlying chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other diseases. Moreover, for the gastroenterologist, doing endoscopic procedures in this COVID-19 era poses a high risk of contamination, as it is an aerosol-generating procedure. There is a daily influx of data on this disease, and multiple societies are coming up with various recommendations. We provide a comprehensive review of all the reported GI manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the side effects of confounding drugs. We have summarized the management recommendations for diseases such as IBD with COVID-19 and nutritional recommendations and provided a concise review of the endoscopy guidelines by the various societies.

These two frameworks have not yet been jointly investigated in the context of esports. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the APA and WHO frameworks for disordered gaming among professional and non-professional gamers and to ascertain the suitability of existing psychometric tools for use in esports. METHODS A sample of 5,734 gamers (Mage = 21.47 years, SD = 6.69 years; 6.94% female) recruited through an online survey prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that included an age and gender matched group of professional (n = 2,867) and non-professional gamers (n = 2,867) was investigated. Pairwise comparisons, measurement invariance (MI), and latent mean difference tests were conducted to distinguish the two groups of gamers. RESULTS Overall, professional gamers showed greater time spent gaming and prevalence of disordered gaming than non-professional gamers. Additionally, MI was supported and both disordered gaming levels and latent means were significantly higher among professional gamers when compared to non-professional gamers across both APA and WHO frameworks. CONCLUSIONS Esports is cross-sectionally associated with greater disordered gaming vulnerability through increased time spent gaming and disordered gaming prevalence rates. Furthermore, the APA and WHO frameworks are viable in the context of esports gaming with existing assessment tools being effective in the assessment of disordered gaming in esports. The results and implications are further discussed in light of the extant literature.","output":"Disordered gaming in esports: Comparing professional and non-professional gamers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the cumulative effect of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway and minimally invasive robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) in comparison with open radical cystectomy (ORC) on length of hospital stay (LOS) and peri-operative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2009 and October 2017, 304 radical cystectomy cases were performed at a single institution (ORC, n = 54; robot-assisted radical cystectomy [RARC], n = 250). Data were prospectively collected. We identified 45 consecutive ORC cases performed without ERAS before the commencement of the RARC programme (Cohort A), 50 consecutive iRARC cases performed without ERAS (Cohort B) and 40 iRARC cases with ERAS (Cohort C). The primary outcome measure was LOS, while secondary outcome measures included peri-operative 90-day complications and readmission rate. Complications were accessed using the Clavien-Dindo system. RESULTS Patients in all cohorts were evenly matched with regard to age, sex, body mass index, neoadjuvant treatment, tumour stage, lymph node yield, previous pelvic radiotherapy and surgery, peri-operative anaemia, as well as physiological state. Patients who underwent iRARC with ERAS had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (III-IV) and were more likely to receive neobladder reconstruction. The median (interquartile range) LOS was shorter in the iRARC with ERAS group (7 [6-10]) days than in the iRARC without ERAS group (11 [8-15]) days and the ORC group (17 [14-21] days). In a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who underwent iRARC, patients who followed the ERAS pathway had significantly lower 90-day readmission rates. Additionally, implementing ERAS in an iRARC cohort resulted in a significantly lower 90-day all (P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal-related complications (P = 0.001). The ERAS pathway and younger patients were independently associated with an LOS of 10 days on multinomial logistic regression. CONCLUSION A comprehensive ERAS programme can significantly reduce LOS in patients undergoing iRARC without increasing 90-day readmission rates. An ERAS programme can augment the benefits of iRARC in improving peri-operative outcomes. In studies comparing ORC and RARC, the presence or absence of an ERAS programme will be a confounding factor and only level 1 evidence can be interpreted reliably.","output":"Intracorporeal robot-assisted radical cystectomy, together with an enhanced recovery programme, improves postoperative outcomes by aggregating marginal gains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease effects about 4.2 million people in Poland, yet Polish organ donation research is rare. In addition, compared to other countries in the world, Poland has a relatively low living donation rate. Still, little is known about how Poles would react to the possibility of living kidney donation to strangers. A study was conducted to examine public opinion about living kidney donation, as well as their knowledge about it, willingness to donate to a stranger, and support for a possible expansion of existing Polish organ donation legislation to include living donation to strangers. METHODS: A self-report questionnaire, which included a socio-demographic datasheet (9 questions), 16 questions about attitudes towards living donation, and 1 question about knowledge concerning transplantation law was sent to the respondents from December 2020 C February 2021. Logistic regression was used to assess factors affecting the support of the legalization of unspecified kidney donation amongst the participants. RESULTS: More than sixty percent (62.1) of respondents supported legalization of unspecified living kidney donation. Such legalization would be accepted by people who accept a choice of a family member to donate a kidney to a stranger (OR = 3.50; Cl 95%: 1.49 to 4.85), who think bone-marrow transplant is safe (OR = 2.65; Cl 95%: 1.80 to 3.91), recognize the benefit of carrying out tests before donating a kidney (OR = 2.56; Cl 95%: 1.79 to 3.69), would agree to receive a kidney from another person (OR = 2.24; Cl 95%: 2.53 to 3.13), or would agree to donate organs after death (OR = 2.06; Cl 95%: 1.45 to 2.95). However, support for unspecified living kidney donation would not be given by respondents fearing the risk of organ trafficking (OR = 0.54; Cl 95%: 0.38 to 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: In Poland there is strong support for legalization of unspecified living kidney donation. It is vital that future legislation define organ trafficking as a crime with serious punishment so that legal unspecified living kidney donation is not hindered.

Given the intermittent nature of certain cardiac arrhythmias, mECGs allow instant access to a recording device. In the COVID-19 pandemic, ways to limit in-person patient interactions and avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services would add value. Our goal was to evaluate whether a mECG device would reduce healthcare utilization overall, particularly those of urgent nature. Objective: To evaluate whether the use of a mobile ECG device would lead to decreased urgent healthcare utilization in individuals with symptomatic arrhythmias. Methods: We identified a cohort of KardiaMobile (AliveCor, USA) mECG users and compared their healthcare utilization 1 year prior to obtaining the device and 1 year after device activation. Results: 128 patients were studied (mean age 64, 47% female). Mean duration of follow-up pre-intervention was 9.78 months. 123 of 128 individuals completed post-intervention follow-up. Patients were less likely to have cardiac monitors ordered (30 vs 6;p&lt;0.01), outpatient office visits (525 vs 382;p&lt;0.01), cardiac-specific ED visits (51 vs 30;p&lt;0.01), arrhythmia related ED visits (45 vs 20;p&lt;0.01), and unplanned arrhythmia admissions (34 vs 11;p&lt;0.01) in the year after obtaining a KardiaMobile device compared to the year prior. Conclusion: Mobile technology is available for heart rhythm monitoring and can give feedback to the user. This study showed a reduction of in-person healthcare utilization with mECG device use. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to limit unnecessary patient contact have value. The use of mECG devices can decrease the risk of exposure to patient and provider from COVID-19, avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services during the pandemic, and may decrease healthcare costs. Given the increases in healthcare costs in recent years, methods to safely and effectively limit cost are needed. One possible strategy could be the use of mECG devices.","output":"B-po03-184 Reduction in Urgent Healthcare Visits by Using a Mobile Electrocardiographic Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 30-year-old male with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever, two days of intermittent abdominal pain, dry cough, nausea, vomiting, four days of diarrhea, and worsening dyspnea.

However, there is still significant debate in the scientific community as to which transmission pathways are most significant and how settings and behaviour affect risk of infection, which all have implications for which mitigation strategies are most effective. This study presents a general model to estimate the rate of viral transfer between individuals, objects, and the air. The risk of infection to individuals in a setting is then computed considering the behaviour and interactions of individuals between themselves and the environment in the setting, survival times of the virus on different surface types and in the air, and mitigating interventions (ventilation, hand disinfection, surface cleaning, etc.). The model includes discrete events such as touch events, individuals entering/leaving the setting, and cleaning events. We demonstrate the model capabilities on three case studies to quantify and understand the relative risk associated with the different transmission pathways and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in different settings. The results show the importance of considering all transmission pathways and their interactions, with each scenario displaying different dominant pathways depending on the setting and behaviours of individuals therein. The flexible model, which is freely available, can be used to quickly simulate the spread of any respiratory virus via the modelled transmission pathways and the efficacy of potential mitigation strategies in any enclosed setting by making reasonable assumptions regarding the behaviour of its occupants. It is hoped that the model can be used to inform sensible decision-making regarding viral infection mitigations that are targeted to specific settings and pathogens.","output":"A semi-continuous model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in enclosed spaces via multiple pathways to assess risk of infection and mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data for India and some of its states between March 10 till October 3, 2020.

The aim of our study was to describe COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in Romanian children and vaccine acceptability in the general population. As parental consent is required for child vaccination in Romania, these aspects have a significant association. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey was conducted in October and November 2021 during the peak of the 4th COVID-19 wave. Results: After validation, 1645 participants formed the main study group: median age 35 years, 72.83% women, and 35.44% from the medical domain. In total, 1311 (79.70%) participants were vaccinated against COVID-19 and 188 (11.42%) had vaccinated their 12C18-year-old children against COVID-19. Parents' level of education, geographic area of residence, and COVID-19 vaccination status were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination. The hesitancy factors of child vaccination included the novelty of COVID-19 vaccines (62, 47.32%), fear of adverse reactions (32, 24.42%), and anti-vaccinism in general (29, 22.13%). In the studied group, only 188 (11.42%) participants recommended vaccination of 5C11-year-old children. Vaccine acceptability was higher in the general population (1311, 79.70%) than in the medical domain (326 out of 583, 55.91%). General vaccine hesitancy was based mainly on beliefs regarding inefficiency (131, 39.22%) and fears about the side effects of the vaccine (76, 22.75%).

However, critical care faces an additional challenge in that it has often been deemed too costly or complicated for resource-poor settings. This lack of prioritization is not justified. Hospital care for the sickest patients affects overall mortality, and public health interventions depend on community confidence in healthcare to ensure participation and adherence. Some of the most effective critical care interventions, including rapid fluid resuscitation, early antibiotics, and patient monitoring, are relatively inexpensive. Although cost-effectiveness studies on critical care in resource-poor settings have not been done, evidence from the surgical literature suggests that even resource-intensive interventions can be cost effective in comparison to immunizations and human immunodeficiency virus care. In the developing world, where many critically ill patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, critical care presents a remarkable opportunity to provide significant incremental benefit, arguably much more so than in the developed world. ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS Key areas of consideration in developing critical care in resource-poor settings include: Personnel and training, equipment and support services, ethics, and research. Strategies for training and retaining skilled labor include tying education to service commitment and developing protocols for even complex processes. Equipment and support services need to focus on technologies that are affordable and sustainable. Ethical decision making must be based on data when possible and on transparent articulated policies always. Research should be performed in resource-poor settings and focus on needs assessment, prognostication, and cost effectiveness. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The development of critical care in resource-poor settings will rely on the stepwise introduction of service improvements, leveraging human resources through training, a focus on sustainable technology, ongoing analysis of cost effectiveness, and the sharing of context-specific best practices. Although prevention, public health, and disease-specific agendas dominate many current conversations in global health, this is nonetheless a time ripe for the development of critical care. Leaders in global health funding hope to improve quality and length of life. Critical care is an integral part of the continuum of care necessary to make that possible.","output":"Critical care in resource-poor settings: lessons learned and future directions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antimicrobial effect of solvent extracts from the rhizome of a thick-stemmed wood fern (Dryopteris crassirhizoma) was evaluated and its phloroglucinol components, flavaspidic acids PB and AB.

AML is the most common leukemia in adults and remains a highly fatal disease with a five-year survival rate of 24%. More than 50% of AML patients have mutations in the FLT3 gene, rendering FLT3 an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition. Currently, there are several FLT3 inhibitors in the clinic, and others remain in clinical trials. However, these inhibitors face challenges due to lack of efficacy against several FLT3 mutants. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers is vital to stratify AML patients and target AML patient population with a particular FLT3 mutation. Additionally, there is an unmet need to identify alternative approaches to combat the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the utilization of diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for FLT3-mutated AML. The resistance mechanisms to various FLT3 inhibitors and alternative approaches to combat this resistance are also discussed and presented.","output":"Role of Biomarkers in FLT3 AML"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) that was emerged as a new member of coronaviruses since December 2019 in Wuhan, China and then after was spread in all continentals. Since SARS-CoV-2 has shown about 77.5% similarity to SARS-CoV, the transcriptome and immunological regulations of SARS-CoV-2 was expected to have high percentage of overlap with SARS-CoV. RESULTS: In this study, we applied the single cell transcriptomics data of human bronchial epithelial cells (2B4 cell line) infected with SARS-CoV, which was annotated in the Expression Atlas database to expand this data to COVID-19. In addition, we employed system biology methods including gene ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway analyses to define functional genes and pathways in the infected cells with SARS-CoV. The transcriptomics analysis on the Expression Atlas database revealed that most genes from infected 2B4 cell line with SARS-CoV were downregulated leading to immune system hyperactivation, induction of signaling pathways, and consequently a cytokine storm. In addition, GO:0016192 (vesicle-mediated transport), GO:0006886 (intracellular protein transport), and GO:0006888 (ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport) were shown as top three GOs in the ontology network of infected cells with SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, R-HAS-6807070 (phosphatase and tensin homolog or PTEN regulation) showed the highest association with other Reactome pathways in the network of infected cells with SARS-CoV. PTEN plays a critical role in the activation of dendritic cells, B- and T-cells, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which cooperates with downregulated genes in the promotion of cytokine storm in the COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the high similarity percentage of the transcriptome of SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2, the data of immunological regulations, signaling pathways, and proinflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV infection can be expanded to COVID-19 to have a valid platform for future pharmaceutical and vaccine studies.","output":"Expansion of Single Cell Transcriptomics Data of SARS-CoV Infection in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the COVID-19 pandemic had claimed over one million lives globally by late 2020, Africa had avoided a massive outbreak Patterson and Balogun analyze pandemic responses by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and various states collaborating with civil society They argue that responses display forms of agency rooted in contextually relevant expertise, pan-African solidarity, and lessons learned about health messaging and community mobilization from previous health crises Yet collaboration has not always been harmonious, as actors have adopted various approaches in their interactions with global health institutions and civil society partnerships, and they have actively debated the use of traditional medicine as a COVID-19 treatment ?

Lidocaine spray is a common anesthetic option and is safe for unsedated EGD. Although several studies have compared different topical anesthetic agents, their formulations, and delivery techniques, questions still remain concerning the optimal mode of administration. We have designed a lidocaine formulation in the form of an ice popsicle and compared its effectiveness and tolerability with lidocaine spray in patients undergoing unsedated EGD. Methods: This was a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial. Unsedated EGD patients were randomly allocated the lidocaine spray [Group (Gp) A] or lidocaine ice popsicle (Gp B) formulation. Results: In total, 204 unsedated EGD patients were evaluated.

After the preliminary tests of data description, unit root analysis and cointegration test, we find that positive and negative components of both the crude oil and petroleum prices move together in the long run. The result suggests evidence of long-run asymmetry in Nigeria. The empirical findings from both the long-run and short-run results show that petroleum prices in Nigeria respond asymmetrically to changes in crude oil prices. Specifically, the outcomes from the study reveal that positive changes (increase) in crude oil prices produce a larger and stronger effect on petroleum prices than the effect of negative changes (decrease) in crude oil prices indicating evidence of an asymmetric relationship between the two prices in Nigeria.

This infection was first reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, and afterward, it became a global pandemic spreading rapidly around the world. As the virus spreads through human to human contact, it has affected our lives in a devastating way, including the vigorous pressure on the public health system, the world economy, education sector, workplaces, and shopping malls. Preventing viral spreading requires early detection of positive cases and to treat infected patients as quickly as possible. The need for COVID-19 testing kits has increased, and many of the developing countries in the world are facing a shortage of testing kits as new cases are increasing day by day. In this situation, the recent research using radiology imaging (such as X-ray and CT scan) techniques can be proven helpful to detect COVID-19 as X-ray and CT scan images provide important information about the disease caused by COVID-19 virus. The latest data mining and machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied along with X-ray and CT scan images of the lungs for the accurate and rapid detection of the disease, assisting in mitigating the problem of scarcity of testing kits. Methods: Hence a novel CNN model called CoroDet for automatic detection of COVID-19 by using raw chest X-ray and CT scan images have been proposed in this study. CoroDet is developed to serve as an accurate diagnostics for 2 class classification (COVID and Normal), 3 class classification (COVID, Normal, and non-COVID pneumonia), and 4 class classification (COVID, Normal, non-COVID viral pneumonia, and non-COVID bacterial pneumonia). Results: The performance of our proposed model was compared with ten existing techniques for COVID detection in terms of accuracy. A classification accuracy of 99.1% for 2 class classification, 94.2% for 3 class classification, and 91.2% for 4 class classification was produced by our proposed model, which is obviously better than the state-of-the-art-methods used for COVID-19 detection to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the dataset with x-ray images that we prepared for the evaluation of our method is the largest datasets for COVID detection as far as our knowledge goes. Conclusion: The experimental results of our proposed method CoroDet indicate the superiority of CoroDet over the existing state-of-the-art-methods. CoroDet may assist clinicians in making appropriate decisions for COVID-19 detection and may also mitigate the problem of scarcity of testing kits.","output":"CoroDet: A deep learning based classification for COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ensuring accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and for the clinical management of COVID-19. Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment and skilled staff limit the use of these time-consuming molecular techniques. Recently, several easy to perform rapid antigen detection tests were developed and recommended in some countries as the first line of diagnostic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test, a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, in comparison to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 148 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates.

Two methods of online delivery were employed: (1) students gathered with a teaching assistant via Zoom to watch a prerecorded video of the laboratory procedure and (2) students gathered on Zoom to watch a livestream of the teaching assistant performing the experiment in the laboratory. A single TA implemented both methods, one in each of two laboratory sections. Student satisfaction with the two delivery methods was compared using a survey and semistructured interviews. Overall, the livestream section received significantly more positive feedback in all aspects, including student investment, perceived conceptual gains, understanding of glassware and techniques, ability to make proper experimental observations, engagement in critical thinking and problem-solving, and general satisfaction with their online lab experience. However, students expressed the belief that the primary role of a teaching laboratory is hands-on experience with chemistry equipment and techniques and that their experience was lacking in this aspect regardless of the lab delivery method. Students described two principal advantages of the livestream delivery. One was the inclusion of opportunities to witness mistakes or unexpected outcomes and then having to take part in the development of a resolution to address those errors;such opportunities were absent for students watching a prerecorded and edited video with a predetermined conclusion. A second aspect was that waiting periods inherent in the live performance of an experimental procedure allowed for unstructured interactions among students and the TA, both to discuss the experiment and to simply socialize.

However, limited data are available on how tracheostomy affects COVID-19 outcomes, and uncertainty surrounding risk of infectious transmission has led to divergent recommendations and practices. METHODS: It is a multicenter, retrospective study; data were collected on all tracheostomies performed in COVID-19 patients at 7 hospitals in 5 tertiary academic medical systems from February 1, 2020 to September 4, 2020. RESULT: Tracheotomy was performed in 118 patients with median time from intubation to tracheostomy of 22 days (Q1CQ3: 18C25). All tracheostomies were performed employing measures to minimize aerosol generation, 78.0% by percutaneous technique, and 95.8% at bedside in negative pressure rooms. Seventy-eight (66.1%) patients were weaned from the ventilator and 18 (15.3%) patients died from causes unrelated to tracheostomy. No major procedural complications occurred. Early tracheostomy (14 days) was associated with decreased ventilator days; median ventilator days (Q1CQ3) among patients weaned from the ventilator in the early, middle and late groups were 21 (21C31), 34 (26.5C42), and 37 (32C41) days, respectively with P = 0.030. Compared to surgical tracheostomy, percutaneous technique was associated with faster weaning for patients weaned off the ventilator [median (Q1CQ3): 34 (29C39) vs 39 (34C51) days, P = 0.038]; decreased ventilator-associated pneumonia (58.7% vs 80.8%, P = 0.039); and among patients who were discharged, shorter intensive care unit duration [median (Q1CQ3): 33 (27C42) vs 47 (33C64) days, P = 0.009]; and shorter hospital length of stay [median (Q1CQ3): 46 (33C59) vs 59.5 (48C80) days, P = 0.001].

As a result, 58 unique cleavage sites were detected, including six that displayed glutamine at the P1 position. Furthermore, modeling results indicated that M(pro) has a far higher potential promiscuity towards substrates than expected. The combination of proteomics and MM/PBSA modeling analysis can thus be useful for elucidating the specificity of M(pro), and thus open novel perspectives for the development of future peptidomimetic drugs against COVID-19, as well as diagnostic tools.","output":"A Proteomics-MM/PBSA Dual Approach for the Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Substrate Peptide Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences of depressive symptoms and perceived family cohesion and adaptability between adolescents and parents during the pandemic; to explore the association between depressive symptoms and family cohesion and adaptability.

CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms influence clopidogrel activity. We aimed to study the clinical impact of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Information on demographics and cerebrovascular status was collected as baseline. Clopidogrel response was tested by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. CYP2C19 genotyping was undertaken by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three-month follow-up data included vascular complications, mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score. Associations were investigated among CYP2C19 genotypes, clopidogrel responsiveness, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and eight participants were included. Median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 48.8-65.0 years), and 35 (32.4%) were male. Forty-four participants were classified into group 1 (homozygous CYP2C19*1/*1); 31, into group 2 (25 with CYP2C19*1/*2, two with CYP2C19*1/*3, three with CYP2C19*3/*3, one with CYP2C19*2/*3); 28, into group 3 (24 with CYP2C19*1/*17, four with CYP2C19*17/*17); and 5, into group 4 (CYP2C19*2/*17). A significantly higher proportion of participants in group 3 experienced ischemic events (9 of 28, 32.1%) compared with group 1 (5 of 44, 11.4%; P = .04; odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.6). There was no significant difference in clopidogrel response among the 4 genotype groups. CONCLUSIONS Individuals with CYP2C19*17 may have increased risk of ischemic events following endovascular treatment, independent of clopidogrel responsiveness.

From all-year and seasonal scenarios, the migration trajectories and cumulative concentration based on the secondary development of Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) in four mining areas (SF, BC, SJZ, and MJT) in Northwest China are studied. The convergent cross mapping (CCM) method is used to study the causal relationship between concentration and meteorological factors. In this process, the problem of missing non-station meteorological data is solved with the help of the inverse distance weighted interpolation method, and the problem in which the convergence requirements of the CCM algorithm cannot meet the requirements is solved with the bootstrap method. The results indicated that the short path has the characteristics of slow movement, short migration path, low altitude(< 1 km), and high contribution rate, while the long path has the opposite characteristics. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the concentration is centered on the pollution source and diffuses around, with a diffusion radius of 220C270 km, showing a serious pollution center and slight gradient settlement on the edge, but the overall distribution of accumulated concentration is uneven. The results also show that temperature (TEMP and S_TEMP), evaporation, and air pressure are the main meteorological factors affecting the all-year concentration. The concentration and meteorological factors in the four mining areas also show significant seasonal characteristics, and the correlation in spring, summer, and autumn is stronger than that in winter. This study not only provides a reference for the green and sustainable exploitation of mineral resources but also provides theoretical support for the joint prevention and control of transboundary pollution.

One of the biggest challenges has been the additional strain put on healthcare systems. Although there are numerous studies on the effects of COVID-19 on intensive care beds and ventilator availability, there has been little exploration into the wider impacts of COVID-19 on the provision of other services. This study was designed to explore how COVID-19 has impacted surgical service provision at a large NHS hospital. METHODS: We compared the number and types of general surgical procedures carried out in a tertiary centre in the six months prior to the UK COVID-19 outbreak (September 2019-February 2020) and the six months after (March 2020-August 2020). RESULTS: We found that since March 2020 there has been a 70% decrease in the amount of operations taking place, with numbers dropping from a pre-COVID total of 1761 to a post-COVID total of 529. This mainly affected elective procedures with emergency surgeries remaining relatively constant (48 pre-COVID vs 44 post-COVID). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has caused a significant decrease in the number of surgeries being undertaken. This is due to a combination of factors including staffing issues, reduced investigative capacity, and national mandates on the cessation of non-urgent procedures. Although this mainly affected elective operations, it will have wider implications on future NHS workload and training.

Paucity of information concerning the virus and therapeutic interventions have made SARS-CoV-2 infection a genuine threat to global public health. Therefore, there is a growing need for understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection at cellular level. To address this, we undertook a systems biology approach by analyzing publicly available RNA-seq datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection of different cells and compared with other lung pathogenic infections. Our study identified several key genes and pathways uniquely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genes such as interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL8, CCL20, CXCL1 and CXCL3 were upregulated, which in particular regulate the cytokine storm and IL-17 signaling pathway. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 infection strongly activated IL-17 signaling pathway compared with other respiratory viruses. Additionally, this transcriptomic signature was also analyzed to predict potential drug repurposing and small molecule inhibitors. In conclusion, our comprehensive data analysis identifies key molecular pathways to reveal underlying pathological etiology and potential therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates interleukin-17-enriched transcriptional response in different cells from multiple organs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been strict limits on visitors to hospitals. This has led to clinicians having an increasing number of difficult conversations with patients and their relatives over the phone. There is a lack of published literature examining how to do this well, but it is recognised that phone communication does differ from face to face interactions, and requires specific training. What is most important to patients and their families when receiving bad news is privacy, adequate time without interruptions, clarity and honesty when delivering the information, and an empathetic and caring attitude. Much of the work done on breaking bad news has been done in oncology and focusses on face to face interaction; there has been an assumption that this is transferrable to the emergency department, and more recently that this is applicable to conversations over the phone. Multiple educational interventions to improve the delivery of bad news have been developed, with differing frameworks to help clinicians carry out this stressful task. Simulation is widely used to train clinicians to break bad news, and has solid theoretical foundations for its use. The psychological safety of participants must be considered, especially with emotive subjects such as breaking bad news. We believe there is a need for specific training in breaking bad news over the phone, and developed an innovative simulation-based session to address this. The training has been well received, and has also highlighted the need for a space where clinicians feel able to discuss the emotional impact of the difficult conversations they are having.","output":"Training for difficult conversations and breaking bad news over the phone in the emergency department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary strain on healthcare systems across North America. Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well suited to answer questions at bedside. METHODS: A multidisciplinary (intensive care, critical care cardiology, and emergency medicine) group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE from the United States and Canada convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aiming to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering focused point-of-care TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although transthoracic echocardiography can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. TEE provides acute care clinicians with a goal-directed framework to guide clinical care and represents an ideal modality to evaluate hemodynamic instability during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs, support cardiac arrest resuscitation, and guide veno-venous ECMO cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, and equipment required before, during, and after an examination.

In the case of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), the viral membrane protein 6K2 plays an essential role in endomembrane alterations. Although 6K2-induced membrane dynamics have been widely studied by confocal microscopy, the ultrastructure of this remodeling has not been extensively examined. In this study, we investigated the formation of TuMV-induced membrane changes by chemical fixation and high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS) for transmission electron microscopy at different times of infection. We observed the formation of convoluted membranes connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) early in the infection process, followed by the production of single-membrane vesicle-like (SMVL) structures at the midstage of infection. Both SMVL and double-membrane vesicle-like structures with electron-dense cores, as well as electron-dense bodies, were found late in the infection process. Immunogold labeling results showed that the vesicle-like structures were 6K2 tagged and suggested that only the SMVL structures were viral RNA replication sites. Electron tomography (ET) was used to regenerate a three-dimensional model of these vesicle-like structures, which showed that they were, in fact, tubules. Late in infection, we observed filamentous particle bundles associated with electron-dense bodies, which suggests that these are sites for viral particle assembly. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. Our work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation. IMPORTANCE Positive-strand RNA viruses remodel cellular membranes for different stages of the infection process, such as protein translation and processing, viral RNA synthesis, particle assembly, and virus transmission. The ultrastructure of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-induced membrane remodeling was investigated over several days of infection. The first change that was observed involved endoplasmic reticulum-connected convoluted membrane accumulation. This was followed by the formation of single-membrane tubules, which were shown to be viral RNA replication sites. Later in the infection process, double-membrane tubular structures were observed and were associated with viral particle bundles. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays.

Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were 95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs  95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were 95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered.

The multivariable regression, overlap weighting, and instrumental variable analyses showed a similar direction and magnitude of association. INTERPRETATION: Critical care for mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia in the ICU was associated with a 7.2% decrease in 30-day in-hospital mortality vs. care in the HDU. Residual confounding may still play a role in the effect estimates.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. MethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. ResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. ConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections.

Despite that human-to-human is the recognized main virus transmission way, several authors supposed pollution-to-human mechanisms to justify the appearance of contagious in Italy. However, these works often suffered of a lack of analysis of possible overlapping of different variables, other than only environmental ones. After a decreasing of detected cases in summer, Europe faced with the appearance of a COVID-19 second wave. In this context the Italy situation appeared to be strange. Indeed, compared with the other selected Countries (France, Germany, UK, and Spain), the Italian infection cases resulted to be lower, in the same analysed period. This work is devoted to find a possible justification of the unexpected situation found in Italy. A comparison of the imposed restrictions in the considered Countries allows to highlight that some policies result more effective to limit the virus spread. This clearly shows that the imposed constraints and the people capacities to receipt them are fundamental parameters that must be always accounted in the determination of the virus expansion. The lesson provided by Italy should be achieved by other member states where the COVID-19 sanitary crisis results to be worse. It is evident that the re-opening of ordinary activities involving people interactions, in Autumn, may contribute to promote a larger SARS-CoV-2 diffusion also in Italy.

The social distancing policies necessary to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have involved increased levels of social isolation. This cross-sectional survey study examined pain severity and interference among individuals with chronic pain during an early phase of social distancing mandates and identified characteristics of individuals who were most impacted. Approximately 4 to 8 weeks after social distancing mandates commenced in the state of Massachusetts, 150 patients with fibromyalgia, chronic spine, and postsurgical pain completed demographic, pain, social distancing, and validated psychosocial questionnaires. Patients self-reported an overall significant increase in pain severity and pain interference, compared with before social distancing, although both pain severity and interference were quite variable among individuals under conditions of social distancing. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors were associated with greater pain severity and interference during social distancing. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that female sex, nonwhite race, lower education, disability, fibromyalgia, and higher pain catastrophizing were independently associated with greater pain severity, while female sex and pain catastrophizing were independently associated greater pain interference. The findings suggest that individual differences among patients with chronic pain should be considered in the planning, development, and prioritization of interventions to improve pain care and to prevent worsening of symptoms during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Cross-sectional study of psychosocial and pain-related variables among patients with chronic pain during a time of social distancing imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A modified compartmental epidemic model was developed to simulate the state of Kuwait protocol in fighting COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we assessed whether it is possible to identify features in molecules, which we refer to as inducers, that can induce the opening of cryptic pockets. The volume change between apo and bound protein conformations was used as a metric to differentiate chemical features in inducers vs. non-inducers. Based on the dataset of holoCapo pairs, classification models were built to determine an optimum threshold. The model analysis suggested that inducers preferred to be more hydrophobic and aromatic. The impact of sulfur was ambiguous, while phosphorus and halogen atoms were overrepresented in inducers.

Although a range of evidence has guided policy, epidemiological models have been central.

We report on a rapid review of studies seeking to integrate epidemiological and economic modelling to assess the impacts of alternative policies. Overall, our results suggest that few studies have explored broader impacts of different COVID-19 policies in the UK. Three studies looked only at health, capturing impacts on individuals with and without COVID-19, with various methods used to model the latter. Four models considered health and wider impacts on individuals economic outcomes, such as wages. However, these models made no attempt to consider the dynamic impacts on economic outcomes of others and the wider economy. The most complex analyses sought to link epidemiological and dynamic economic models. Studies compared a wide range of policies, although most were defined in general terms with minimal consideration of their granular specifications. There was minimal exploration of uncertainty, with no consideration in half the studies. Selecting appropriate models to inform decisions requires careful thought of factors relevant to the decision options under consideration such as the outcomes of interest, sectors likely to be impacted and causal pathways.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited patients aged 20 years referred to the ED of the National Taiwan University Hospital between March 1 and April 30, 2020. A double triage and telemedicine protocol was developed to triage suggested COVID-19 cases and minimize health workers exposure to this disease. We categorized patients attending video interviews into a telemedicine group and patients experiencing face-to-face interviews into a conventional group. A questionnaire was used to assess how patients perceived the quality of the interviews and their communication with physicians as well as perceptions of stress, discrimination, and privacy. Each question was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Physicians total exposure time and total evaluation time were treated as primary outcomes, and the mean scores of the questions were treated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The final sample included 198 patients, including 93 cases (47.0%) in the telemedicine group and 105 cases (53.0%) in the conventional group. The total exposure time in the telemedicine group was significantly shorter than that in the conventional group (4.7 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was significantly longer than that in the conventional group (12.2 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001). After controlling for potential confounders, the total exposure time in the telemedicine group was 4.6 minutes shorter than that in the conventional group (95% CI ?5.7 to ?3.5, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was 2.8 minutes longer than that in the conventional group (95% CI ?1.6 to ?4.0, P<.001).

Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed.

Lockdowns imposed due to the Covid\\\\19 outbreak led to unprecedented changes in the life of older adults. However, little is known about emotional distress consequences. We assessed associations of grey matter (GM) volumes (N=179), cognitive and motor functions (N=403) with emotional distress of older adults with T2D from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (IDCD). METHODS: During the first Covid\\\\19\\\\related lockdown in Israel, we applied a phone questionnaire, which included information about anxiety (Over the last two weeks, how much have you been bothered by Feeling anxious or nervous?; Anxiety levels now compared to before Covid\\\\19), depression (Over the last two weeks, how much have you been bothered by feeling sad, down, or uninterested in life?; sad feelings now compared to before Covid\\\\19), general well\\\\being (How are you feeling in general?), optimism towards the future (Are you optimistic towards the future?). Grey matter (GM) volumes (measured by high resolution T1\\\\weighted MRI), cognitive (a global measure summarizing 14 cognitive tests) and motor function (gait speed and grip strength), are routinely assessed by the IDCD study. Spearman correlation adjusting for age, sex, education, HbA1c and duration of T2D (as well as TICV for the GM analyses) examined associations of GM, cognitive and motor functions with emotional distress measures. RESULTS: The sample averaged 72 years of age (SD=4.4), and 14 years of education (SD=3.5); 40.9% were female. Lower grip strength prior to lockdown was associated with increased sadness (r=\\\\0.21, p<0.001) and anxiety (r=\\\\.011, p=0.020), less optimism (r=0.10, p=0.042) and lower general feeling (r=0.17, p=0.0005).

We include among these patients at risk those who are negative for the SARS-COV-2 infection, but suffering with COVID-19 pandemic syndrome. Beside managements of psychological symptoms, it is mandatory to offer to the last group physical rehabilitation approaches easy to learn and self-managed at home.

Decades of research indicate that when social connectedness is threatened, mental health is at risk. However, extant interventions to tackle loneliness have had only modest success, and none have been trialled under conditions of such threat.Method. 174 young people with depression and loneliness were randomised to one of two evidence-based treatments: cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or GROUPS 4 HEALTH (G4H), an intervention designed to increase social group belonging. Depression, loneliness, and well-being outcomes were evaluated at one-year follow-up;COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed partway through follow-up assessments. This provided a quasi-experimental test of the utility of each intervention in the presence (lockdown group) and absence (control group) of a threat to social connectedness. Results. At one-year follow-up, participants in lockdown reported significantly poorer wellbeing than controls who completed follow-up before lockdown, t(152)=2.41, p=.017. Although both CBT and G4H led to symptom improvement, the benefits of G4H were more robust following an unanticipated threat to social connectedness for depression (2(16)=31.35, p=.001), loneliness (2(8)=21.622, p=.006), and wellbeing (2(8)=22.938, p=.003). Limitations. Because the COVID-19 lockdown was unanticipated, this analysis represents an opportunistic use of available data. As a result, we could not measure the specific impact of restrictions on participants, such as reduced income, degree of isolation, or health-related anxieties.Conclusions. G4H delivered one year prior to COVID-19 lockdown offered greater protection than CBT against relapse of loneliness and depression symptoms.

During COVID-19 pandemic, the constant fear of going outside and to use health services may have had an impact in the number of visits to Community Pharmacies. This research aimed to study self-medication habits of the Portuguese population during the current pandemic, more specifically, to understand which non-prescription drugs and food supplements were taken and the situations that conduced to the use of self-medication. Methods An online structured survey was conducted, with data obtained anonymously and included 170 participants (18 years). Data were processed using SPSS v26. Results Participants in this study were mainly female (81.2%), with a mean age of 38.01  1.16 years old and most (84.7%) over 12 years of schooling. Answers allowed to verify that the current pandemic didn't affect that much the frequency of visits to Pharmacy and the situations where people used self-medication were mainly minor, such as headaches (54.1%) and muscle pains (26.5%). The medications used more often were analgesics (60.0%) and anti-inflammatory (40.0%). However, many people indicated that they didt seek for more information about medicines (49.4%) and/or supplements (7.6%) used during this period. In general, people visited the Pharmacy with a similar frequency and purpose as the previous year. Conclusions Despite all the changes, the current pandemic has not negatively affected the practice of self-medication.

Organophosphates are the most common agrochemical poisons followed closely by herbicides. Many agricultural poisons, such as parathion and paraquat are now mixed with a coloring agent such as indigocarmine to prevent their use criminally. In addition, paraquat is fortified with a stenching agent. Organo-chlorines have an entirely different mechanism of action. Whereas organophosphates have an anticholinesterase activity, organochlorines act on nerve cells interfering with the transmission of impulses through them. A kerosene-like smell also emanates from death due to organochlorines. The diagnosis lies in the chemical identification of organochlorines in the stomach contents or viscera. Organochlorines also resist putrefaction and can be detected long after death. Paraquat has been involved in suicidal, accidental, and homicidal poisonings. It is mildly corrosive and ulceration around lips and mouth is common in this poisoning. However, the hallmark of paraquat poisoning, especially when the victim has survived a few days, are the profound changes in lungs. Other agrochemicals such as algicides, aphicides, herbicide safeneres, fertilizers, and so on, are less commonly encountered. Governments in most countries have passed legislations to prevent accidental poisonings with these agents. The US government passed the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in 1962 and the Indian government passed The Insecticides Act in 1968.

Since then researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID-19 showed a wide range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0). We found that ACE1  genotype, frequency of D allele, older age (&#8805;46 years), unmarried status, and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patient.

Cytochrome P450 oxygenates PUFAs to produce anti-inflammatory and pain-resolving epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs) and other oxylipins whose epoxide ring is opened by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH/Ephx2), resulting in the formation of toxic and pro-inflammatory vicinal diols (dihydroxy-FAs). Pharmacological inhibition of sEH is a promising strategy for the treatment of pain, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions. We tested the efficacy of a potent, selective sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Prophylactic TPPU treatment significantly ameliorated EAE without affecting circulating white blood cell counts. TPPU accumulated in the spinal cords (SCs), which was correlated with plasma TPPU concentration. Targeted lipidomics in EAE SCs and plasma identified that TPPU blocked production of dihydroxy-FAs efficiently and increased some EpFA species including 12(13)-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (12(13)-EpOME) and 17(18)-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (17(18)-EpETE). TPPU did not alter levels of cyclooxygenase (COX-1/2) metabolites, while it increased 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and other 12/15-lipoxygenase metabolites. These analytical results are consistent with sEH inhibitors that reduce neuroinflammation and accelerate anti-inflammatory responses, providing the possibility that sEH inhibitors could be used as a disease modifying therapy, as well as for MS-associated pain relief.","output":"A Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) Urea, Ameliorates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the psychological changes in suspected patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and obtained evidence for early psychological guidance and intervention in this group.

RESULTS: The overall incidence of RM was 2.2%. Compared with patients without RM, those with RM tended to have a higher risk of deterioration. Patients with RM also constituted a greater percentage of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (90.9% vs 5.3%, Pa<a0.001) and a greater percentage of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (86.4% vs 2.7% Pa<a0.001). Moreover, patients with RM had laboratory test abnormalities, including the presence of markers of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and kidney injury. Patients with RM also had a higher risk of in-hospital death (Pa<a0.001). Cox's proportional hazard regression model analysis confirmed that RM indicators, including peak creatine kinase (CK) levels >a1000aIU/L (HRa=a6.46, 95% CI: 3.02-13.86) and peak serum myoglobin (MYO) concentrations >a1000ang/mL (HRa=a9.85, 95% CI: 5.04-19.28), were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 that developed RM tended to have delayed viral clearance. CONCLUSION: RM might be an important contributing factor to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step. RESULTS The study included 190 IAs.

The aim of this study was to examine the resistance rates of less frequent uropathogenic Gram-negatives in a population of patients treated in a Department of Urology of a tertiary referral centre in Central Europe over a period of 9 years. METHODS: Data on all positive urine samples from urological in- and out-patients were extracted form the Department of Clinical Microbiology database from 2011 to 2019. Numbers of susceptible and resistant isolates per year were calculated for these uropathogens: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 74), Citrobacter spp. (n = 60), Enterobacter spp. (n = 250), Morganella morganii (n = 194), Providencia spp. (n = 53), Serratia spp. (n = 82) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27). Antimicrobial agents selected for the survey included: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam; cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime; ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin; gentamicin and amikacin; ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), nitrofurantoin and colistin. RESULTS: Penicillin derivatives have generally poor effect except piperacillin/tazobactam. Cefuroxime is not efficient unlike cefotaxime (except against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia). Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is limited. Amikacin is somewhat more efficient than gentamicine but susceptibilities for both safely exceed 80%. Nitrofurantoin shows virtually no efficiency. Cotrimoxazole acts well against Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp. and it is the treatment of choice for S. maltophilia UTIs. Among carbapenems, ertapenem was less efficient than meropenem and imipenem except for S. maltophilia whose isolates were mostly not suceptible to any carbapenems.

Some of these tiny particles have caused disastrous pandemics that killed a large number of people with subsequent economic downturns. In addition, the quarantine situation itself encounters the challenges like the deficiency in the online educational system, psychiatric problems and poor international relations. Although viruses have a rather simple protein structure, they have structural heterogeneity with a high tendency to mutation that impedes their study. On top of the breadth of such worldwide worrying issues, there are profound scientific gaps, and several unanswered questions, like lack of vaccines or antivirals to combat these pathogens. Various detection techniques like the nucleic acid test, immunoassay, and microscopy have been developed; however, there is a tradeoff between their advantages and disadvantages like safety in sample collecting, invasiveness, sensitivity, response time, etc. One of the highly resolved techniques that can provide early-stage detection with fast experiment duration is plasmonics. This optical technique has the capability to detect viral proteins and genomes at the early stage via highly sensitive interaction between the biological target and the plasmonic chip. The efficiency of this technique could be proved using commercialized techniques like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. In this study, we aim to review the role of plasmonic technique in the detection of 11 deadliest viruses besides 2 common genital viruses for the human being. This is a rapidly moving topic of research, and a review article that encompasses the current findings may be useful for guiding strategies to deal with the pandemics. By investigating the potential aspects of this technique, we hope that this study could open new avenues toward the application of point-of-care techniques for virus detection at early stage that may inhibit the progressively hygienic threats.","output":"Role of plasmonics in detection of deadliest viruses: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) outbreak has triggered massive debates within dental professional organizations about prioritization of offered services, served groups, and required protective measures.(Volgenant et al., 2020) While navigating through the post\\\\outbreak era, we aim to demonstrate the importance of continuous global focus on the burden of non\\\\communicable diseases (NCDs) such as oral diseases.

One such measure was a 'total lockdown' for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","output":"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December, 2019, an infectious outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, which attracted intense attention.

However, they reported contradicting findings due to limited data available at an earlier stage of the outbreak. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the impact of regional temperature on the pandemic in 34 different locations of the globe by defining two main objectives. The first objective is focused on pattern analysis of an earlier stage of the pandemic. The conducted analysis suggests that the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak during its initial stage was slower in the regions experiencing extreme temperatures. The second objective is about understanding the impact of temperature on new cases (NC) and new deaths (ND) of COVID-19 reported per day by using linear regression (LR) as a statistical tool. For most of the locations, under simple LR analysis, a significant inverse relationship has been observed between average temperature and NC or ND. However, a few locations, including Pakistan, India, Singapore, Bahrain, and Qatar, have shown a significant positive relationship between average temperature and NC with a 99.9% confidence level. Furthermore, Pakistan, Thailand, Bahrain, and Qatar have shown a significant positive relationship between average temperature and ND with a 95% confidence level. Although most of these locations experienced temperatures with a mean greater than 22 C and standard deviation greater than 5 C, excluding India, the number of total COVID-19 cases reported in these locations is small.

METHODS: Online advertisements were used to recruit people with persistent low mood. Those who also had current hazardous alcohol consumption were identified and invited to take part in the trial (those not eligible were offered access to the online depression intervention). Participants were randomized to an established intervention for depression (MoodGYM; M-only) or to receive MoodGYM plus a brief personalized feedback intervention for hazardous drinking (Check Your Drinking; M + CYD). Participants were followed-up at three and six months. RESULTS: While levels of depression symptoms (p < .001) and hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001) reduced in both the M-only and the M + CYD groups, there was no difference between groups on drinking (p = .374) or depression outcomes (p = .752). Further, participants who were provided both interventions logged into the intervention website less often (M = 4.1, SD = 3.9) compared to participants only offered the depression intervention (M = 4.9, SD = 5.2), t (986) = 2.47, p = .014. However, there was no significant difference (p > .05) in the number of MoodGYM modules completed between the two groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current trial found no benefit to providing a brief online intervention for hazardous alcohol consumption alongside one for depression among people experiencing these co-occurring disorders. Further, the finding that adding an online intervention for drinking to one for depression led to a small reduction in the number of times the interventions were accessed implies the need for caution when deciding how best to provide online help to those with co-occurring depression and hazardous alcohol consumption.

METHODS: Asymptomatic judiciary staff of Jodhpur and Jaipur benches of High Courts were enrolled after informed written consent. A questionnaire was filled and 3C5 ml venous blood was collected from participants. The ICMR-NIV COVID Kavach IgG ELISA and EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA were used for detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 63 samples (41 from Jodhpur and 22 from Jaipur) were collected between 28(th) July to 4(th) August 2020. The overall anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was found to be 6.35%.

Here, we screened 1,200 FDA-approved drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library, to identify compounds that increase NK cell cytotoxic potential. Using a high-throughput luciferase-release cytotoxicity assay, we found that the antibiotic colistin sulfate increased cytotoxicity of human NK cells towards cancer cells. The effect of colistin was short lived and was not observed when NK cells were pretreated with the drug, showing how NK cell activity was potentiated only when the compound was present at the time of recognition of cancer cells.

METHODS: From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT. For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained. The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes. Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared. RESULTS: Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung. Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation. A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved. The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%). Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved. The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with \\"white lungs.\\" The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance.

METHODS Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus) and grey literature databases were systematically searched from inception to October 2021 using free text syntax combining synonyms for 'mental health problems' and 'social network interventions'. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported data from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve social networks for adults (18+) with mental health problems. Papers were independently reviewed for inclusion with conflicts resolved through consensus. Included papers were quality assessed and data extracted and synthesized narratively. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS Nine studies randomising 2226 participants were included. Four focused on those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, one on major depressive disorder and four included all types of mental health diagnoses. The current evidence base is of unclear quality. However, interventions which focused on supporting social activities appear to hold the most promise for enhancing social networks. Data on cost-effectiveness and research acceptability were limited, but suggest the potential economic feasibility of and acceptability for evaluating these interventions.

Selenoproteins contain selenocysteine in the active center and include, i.a., the enzymes thioredoxin reductases (TXNRD1C3), glutathione peroxidases (GPX1C4 and GPX6) and methionine sulfoxide reductase, involved in immune functions, metabolic homeostasis, and antioxidant defense. Ageing is an inevitable process, which, i.a., involves an imbalance between antioxidative defense and reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in protein and mitochondrial renewal, telomere attrition, cellular senescence, epigenetic alterations, and stem cell exhaustion. These conditions are associated with mild to moderate inflammation, which always accompanies the process of ageing and age-related diseases. In older individuals, Se, by being a component in protective enzymes, operates by decreasing ROS-mediated inflammation, removing misfolded proteins, decreasing DNA damage, and promoting telomere length. Se-dependent GPX1C4 and TXNRD1C3 directly suppress oxidative stress. Selenoprotein H in the cell nucleus protects DNA, and selenoproteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assist in the removal of misfolded proteins and protection against ER stress.

Due to the limited published literature reflecting on this transition, this article employed a systematic scoping review methodology. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to explore the role of teledentistry in the provision of clinical dental services in Australia. DESIGN: Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and grey literature sources to identify literature eligible for inclusion. The search was restricted to Australia and service delivery. Data were categorically synthesised by modalities and reported benefits and limitations; findings were cross-referenced with the COVID-19 pandemic timeline. FINDINGS: The systematic search identified 758 articles, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria. Results highlight a range of service providers and definitions of teledentistry. A shift in modality from asynchronous towards synchronous teledentistry pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic is detailed. DISCUSSION: Whilst highly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, teledentistry provides a unique opportunity to continue to increase the accessibility of dental services, especially for patients in rural areas or those who are immunocompromised. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and researchers must consider opportunities to merge existing research with the recent clinical uptake of teledentistry for patients that would benefit from teledental services beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The evolution of the teledentistry landscape in Australia: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandisa Greene is a name for the history books As the first black president of the RCVS, she strives to increase diversity in the professions Here, Josh Loeb chats to her about her plans for the year","output":"Change is a marathon, not a sprint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Additional studies are required to answer these important questions regarding appropriate dosing strategies and intervals.

Currently, it has affected more than 2,850,000 people. No vaccine or drug is available yet, and therefore researchers and scientists are striving to identify potential drugs or vaccines for combating this virus. We were unable to find any review of the literature or analysis on ongoing registered clinical trials that reported diagnostic tests, therapeutics, vaccines and devices for COVID-19 along with estimated enrollment, participants' ages, study type, start and completion date, status, treatment/intervention and country. OBJECTIVE To review ongoing trials relating to COVID-19. METHODS A systematic search for clinical trials was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to April 12, 2020. A total of 339 trials relating to COVID-19 were analyzed and key information on each trial was recorded. RESULTS Most of the trials were being conducted in the United States and completion of most of them was expected by May 2020. They were mostly on drugs and treatment, while a minority were on diagnostic tests. The analysis showed that hydroxychloroquine was investigated in most of the trials. The trials identified were categorized into five classes: a) diagnostic tests; b) therapeutics; c) biologics and vaccines; d) devices and products; and e) others. CONCLUSION The trials identified have potential against COVID-19 that can be applied in treatment processes after the necessary investigations and experiments.

BACKGROUND: Little research has been published about the experiences of nurse managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of front-line nurses have been well documented. This is the first phenomenological study to date in the United States on experiences of hospital nurse managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Phenomenological qualitative approach. METHODS: Thirteen managers, seven nurse managers and six assistant nurse managers were interviewed about their experiences using audio-video teleconferencing and a semi-structured interview guide. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research criteria for reporting qualitative research were used. RESULTS: The four major themes that emerged were as follows: being there for everyone; leadership challenges; struggles, support and coping; and strengthening my role. There were 11 subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: A major focus of nurse managers during the pandemic was psychosocial support of front-line nurses while at the same time experiencing stress and exhaustion themselves. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: More attention on the psychosocial needs of nurse managers, interventions to allay their exhaustion and provisions for readily available support are warranted.","output":"A Phenomenological Study of Nurse Managers' and Assistant Nurse Managers' Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remyelination is the phenomenon by which new myelin sheaths are generated around axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS). This follows the pathological loss of myelin in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination can restore conduction properties to axons (thereby restoring neurological function) and is increasingly believed to exert a neuroprotective role on axons. Remyelination occurs in many MS lesions but becomes increasingly incomplete/inadequate and eventually fails in the majority of lesions and patients. Efforts to understand the causes for this failure of regeneration have fueled research into the biology of remyelination and the complex, interdependent cellular and molecular factors that regulate this process. Examination of the mechanisms of repair of experimental lesions has demonstrated that remyelination occurs in two major phases. The first consists of colonization of lesions by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the second the differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes that contact demyelinated axons to generate functional myelin sheaths. Several intracellular and extracellular molecules have been identified that mediate these two phases of repair. Theoretically, the repair of demyelinating lesions can be promoted by enhancing the intrinsic repair process (by providing one or more remyelination\\\\enhancing factors or via immunoglobulin therapy). Alternatively, endogenous repair can be bypassed by introducing myelinogenic cells into demyelinated areas; several cellular candidates have been identified that can mediate repair of experimental demyelinating lesions. Future challenges confronting therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination will involve the translation of findings from basic science to clinical demyelinating disease.","output":"Remyelination In Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Clinical effectiveness data on remdesivir are urgently needed, especially among diverse populations and in combination with other therapies. Objective: To examine whether remdesivir administered with or without corticosteroids for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with more rapid clinical improvement in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from March 4 to August 29, 2020, in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, area. Of 2483 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection assessed by polymerase chain reaction, those who received remdesivir were matched to infected individuals who did not receive remdesivir using time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate orders) and time-dependent covariates (ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, complete white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, albumin level, alanine aminotransferase level, glomerular filtration rate, dimerized plasmin fragment D [D-dimer] level, and oxygen device). An individual in the remdesivir group with k days of treatment was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (5 days maximum) beyond the matching day. Exposures: Remdesivir treatment with or without corticosteroid administration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge or decrease of 2 points on the World Health Organization severity score), and the secondary outcome, mortality at 28 days. An additional outcome was clinical improvement and time to death associated with combined remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment. Results: Of 2483 consecutive admissions, 342 individuals received remdesivir, 184 of whom also received corticosteroids and 158 of whom received remdesivir alone. For these 342 patients, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 46-69 years), 189 (55.3%) were men, and 276 (80.7%) self-identified as non-White race/ethnicity. Remdesivir recipients had a shorter time to clinical improvement than matched controls without remdesivir treatment (median, 5.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-8.0 days] vs 7.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-10.0 days]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]). Remdesivir recipients had a 28-day mortality rate of 7.7% (22 deaths) compared with 14.0% (40 deaths) among matched controls, but this difference was not statistically significant in the time-to-death analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.38-1.28). The addition of corticosteroids to remdesivir was not associated with a reduced hazard of death at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.67-5.57). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19, receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients. Remdesivir plus corticosteroid administration did not reduce the time to death compared with remdesivir administered alone.","output":"Comparison of Time to Clinical Improvement With vs Without Remdesivir Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel necrosis of premature infants and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants born between 23 and 28 weeks of gestation.

In many patients, thrombocytopenia is severe and is treated with one or more platelet transfusions. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and biological implications of NEC-related thrombocytopenia remain unclear. This review presents current evidence from human and animal studies on the clinical features and mechanisms of platelet depletion in NEC.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of filtered and nonfiltered HMEs placed between nebulizer and patient on aerosol deposition and airway resistance (Raw) in simulated ventilator-dependent adults. METHODS An in vitro lung model was developed to simulate a mechanically ventilated adult (Vt 500 mL, RR 15/min, and PEEP 5 cmH2O, using two inspiratory flow rates 40 and 50 L/min) using an intubated adult manikin with an endotracheal tube (8 mmID). The bronchi of the manikin were connected to a Y-adapter through a collecting filter (Respirgard II) attached to a test lung through a heated humidifier (37C producing 100% relative humidity) to simulate exhaled humidity. For treatment conditions, a nonfiltered HME (ThermoFlo? 6070; ARC Medical) and filtered HMEs (ThermoFlo? Filter; ARC Medical and PALL Ultipor; Pall Medical) were placed between the ventilator circuit at the endotracheal tube and allowed to acclimate to the exhaled heat and humidity for 30 minutes before aerosol administration. Airway resistance (cmH2O/L/s) was taken at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after HME placement and after each of four aerosol treatments. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was administered with jet (Misty Max 10; Airlife) and mesh (Aerogen Solo; Aerogen) nebulizers positioned in the inspiratory limb proximal to the Y-adapter. Control consisted of nebulization with no HME. Drug was eluted from filter at the end of the trachea and measured using spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS Greater than 60% of the control dose was delivered through the ThermoFlo. No significant difference was found between the first four treatments given by the jet (p = 0.825) and the mesh (p = 0.753) nebulizers. There is a small increase in Raw between pre- and post-four treatments with the jet (p = 0.001) and mesh (p = 0.015) nebulizers. Aerosol delivery through filtered HMEs was similar (<0.5%) across the four treatments. Airway resistance was similar using the ThermoFlo Filter. With the PALL Ultipor, changes in Raw increased with mesh nebulizer after treatment (p = 0.005). Changes in resistance pre- and post-treatment were similar with both filtered HMEs. CONCLUSION The ThermoFlo? nonfilter HME allowed the majority of the control dose to be delivered to the airway. Increases in Raw would likely not be outside of a tolerable range in ventilated patients. In contrast, filtered HMEs should not be placed between nebulizers and patient airways. Further research with other HMEs and materials is warranted.","output":"Effect of Heat Moisture Exchanger on Aerosol Drug Delivery and Airway Resistance in Simulated Ventilator-Dependent Adults Using Jet and Mesh Nebulizers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the meantime, as COVID-19 has gone pandemic, social distancing has become inevitable; therefore, most in-person visits have been canceled to minimize the spread of the disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, from June 2020 until December 2020 on 4052 respondents from the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. An online survey was used to collect information about various stress factors. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by using the COVID-19 impact event scale (COVID-19 IES), whereas general stress levels were assessed by K10 Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). RESULTS: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak revealed that 35.4% of participants suffered from moderate or severe psychological impact (score>33); 19.7% had a mild psychological impact (scores24C32), whereas 44.9% reported minimal psychological impact (score <23). The factors significantly associated with higher stress scores and COVID-19 IES included male gender, low monthly income, having a private business, living in apartments/residential complexes, poor general health status, visit hospital/doctor in the past three months, presence of chronic disease, direct/indirect contact with someone diagnosed with/suspected to have COVID-19, contact with surfaces/tools infected with COVID-19, getting screened or quarantined for COVID-19, follow-up of the latest news about COVID-19 and knowledge of a greater number of people infected and died with COVID-19 (p < 0.05).

Reports were evaluated independently by trained coders to assess adherence to professional journalism recommendations using a 14-item checklist. In total, 788 eligible media reports were considered. Of those, 50.5% and 47.3%, respectively, failed to mention the real and complete names of the writer and editor. Reports improperly mentioned specific details about the time, place, methods, and perpetrators of violence in 42.1%, 36.4%, 45.4%, and 54.6% of cases, respectively. Over 80% of reports excluded a suggestion to seek help from professional agencies or mediation by a third party and only 3.8% of reports mentioned the perspectives of all three key informants about an event: medical care providers, patients, and hospital administrators. Of those that mentioned medical care providers, patient, and/or hospital administrator perspectives, less than 20% indicated they had obtained the interviewees consent to include their perspective. We concluded that most reports about violence against medical care providers in the Chinese media failed to strictly follow reporting recommendations from authoritative media bodies.

Also 3-D multilayer tumor spheroids established from such cells were effectively eradicated. Next, we investigated whether FIPV and fMHV could be targeted to human cancer cells by constructing a bispecific single-chain antibody directed on the one hand against the feline coronavirus spike protein C responsible for receptor binding and subsequent cell entry through virusCcell membrane fusion C and on the other hand against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The targeting antibody mediated specific infection of EGFR-expressing human cancer cells by both coronaviruses. Furthermore, in the presence of the targeting antibody, infected cancer cells formed syncytia typical of productive coronavirus infection. By their potent cytotoxicity, the selective targeting of non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells provides a rationale for further investigations into the use of these viruses as anticancer agents.","output":"Targeting non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells using a bispecific single-chain antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a significant cause for intensive care unit (ICU) admission worldwide.

We describe the diagnostic process behind diagnosing GBS in an elderly male who developed acute-onset quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a military ICU. A 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir with improvement. On hospital day 32, the patient was extubated. Three days later, he developed acute, symmetric limb quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure requiring reintubation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a cytoalbuminologic dissociation, and electromyography/nerve conduction study showed slowed nerve conduction velocity. These findings are consistent with GBS. Blood cultures, serum polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical symptoms were not suggestive of other common pathogens causing his GBS. The patient's acute GBS in the setting of recent severe COVID-19 infection strongly suggests association between the two entities, as supported by a growing body of case literature.

Methods: We analyzed all Adverse Vaccine Reaction reports to the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between December 9, 2020 and June 30, 2021 that mentioned the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines. We compared the rates of adverse neurological and psychiatric reactions with ChAdOx1 to those with BNT162b2. P-values were obtained by a Bonferroni-adjusted Z-test for proportions. Results: As of June 30, 2021, 53.2 M doses of ChAdOx1 and 46.1 M doses of BNT162b2 had been administered. We extracted information from 300,518 distinct reports. The number of individual adverse neurologic or psychiatric reaction reports were less than 200/M doses administered, except headache which was reported in 1,550 and 395 cases/M doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, respectively. Compared to BNT162b2, cerebral hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, headaches and migraines, Guillain-Barre syndrome and paresthesias, tremor and freezing, delirium, hallucinations, nervousness, poor sleep quality, and postural dizziness were more frequently reported with ChAdOx1. Reactions more frequently reported with BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 were Bell's palsy, facial paralysis, dysgeusia, anxiety, and presyncope or syncope. Conclusion: Significant differences in the neurologic and psychiatric adverse event profiles of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines may exist, emphasizing the need for additional research. The beneficial and protective effects of the COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the low potential risk of neurologic and psychiatric reactions.","output":"Disproportionality analysis of adverse neurological and psychiatric reactions with the ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vitamin C deprivation can lead to fatigue, dyspnea, oedema and chest pain, which are also symptoms of heart failure (HF). In animal studies vitamin C has improved contractility and mechanical efficiency of the heart. Compared with healthy people, patients with HF have lower vitamin C levels, which are not explained by differences in dietary intake levels, and more severe HF seems to be associated with lower plasma vitamin C levels. This meta-analysis looks at the effect of vitamin C on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS: We searched for trials reporting the effects of vitamin C on LVEF. We assessed the quality of the trials, and pooled selected trials using the inverse variance, fixed effect options. We used meta-regression to examine the association between the effect of vitamin C on LVEF level and the baseline LVEF level. RESULTS: We identified 15 trials, three of which were excluded from our meta-analysis. In six cardiac trials with 246 patients, vitamin C increased LVEF on average by 12.0% (95% CI 8.1C15.9%; P < 0.001). In six non-cardiac trials including 177 participants, vitamin C increased LVEF on average by 5.3% (95% CI 2.0C8.5%; P = 0.001). In meta-regression analysis we found that the effect of vitamin C was larger in trials with the lowest baseline LVEF levels with P = 0.001 for the test of slope. The meta-regression line crossed the null effect level at a baseline LVEF level close to 70%, with progressively greater benefit from vitamin C with lower LVEF levels. Some of the included trials had methodological limitations. In a sensitivity analysis including only the four most methodologically sound cardiac trials, the effect of vitamin C was not substantially changed. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, vitamin C increased LVEF in both cardiac and non-cardiac patients, with a strong negative association between the size of the vitamin C effect and the baseline LVEF. Further research on vitamin C and HF should be carried out, particularly in patients who have low LVEF together with low vitamin C intake or low plasma levels. Different dosages and different routes of administration should be compared.","output":"Vitamin C May Improve Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appearance at the end of 2019 of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus led to an unprecedented response by the structural biology community, resulting in the rapid determination of many hundreds of structures of proteins encoded by the virus As part of an effort to analyze and, if necessary, remediate these structures as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), this work presents a detailed analysis of 81 crystal structures of the main protease 3CL(pro), an important target for the design of drugs against COVID-19 The structures of the unliganded enzyme and its complexes with a number of inhibitors were determined by multiple research groups using different experimental approaches and conditions;the resulting structures span 13 different polymorphs representing seven space groups The structures of the enzyme itself, all determined by molecular replacement, are highly similar, with the exception of one polymorph with a different inter-domain orientation However, a number of complexes with bound inhibitors were found to pose significant problems Some of these could be traced to faulty definitions of geometrical restraints for ligands and to the general problem of a lack of such information in the PDB depositions Several problems with ligand definition in the PDB itself were also noted In several cases extensive corrections to the models were necessary to adhere to the evidence of the electron-density maps Taken together, this analysis of a large number of structures of a single, medically important protein, all determined within less than a year using modern experimental tools, should be useful in future studies of other systems of high interest to the biomedical community","output":"Crystallographic models of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro): in-depth assessment of structure quality and validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern is expanding globally.

We retrospectively analyzed the patients admitted to the ICU (137 patients) and general wards (114 patients) of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital in China. The population characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory examination results between the patients in the ICU and those in the general wards were compared. Furthermore, the differences between the deceased patients in the ICU and those discharged from the ICU were compared. RESULTS There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, no presence of complications, presence of 1 complication, and presence of 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences between the patients in terms of the laboratory examination results including elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-, troponin I, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets, lymphocyte absolute value, and eosinophil absolute value (<0.05).

It investigates whether residents, specifically of apartment buildings in Cairo, used their balconies more frequently or for different activities during the lockdown. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted through a mixed methods approach. More specifically, a sequential explanatory design was adopted where quantitative data were collected at first followed by qualitative data collection. The study proceeded in two stages. First, an online questionnaire with 160 respondents was conducted to depict the change in the frequency and use patterns of balconies pre/post lockdown in Cairo. The respondents were approached through snowball sampling. Second, in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 participants, approached through convenience sampling, were done. The interviews aimed to provide interpretation and rationale for the responses, patterns and correlations identified from the questionnaire results. Findings: The findings of this study confirm that there is a change in the pattern of use of balconies in terms of frequency and the types of hosted activities. The analysis revealed three key ideas that characterize those changes: the balcony as a found space, as a loose space and as a space of self-expression at home. It also expands on spatial qualities of balconies that promoted their use. The study emphasizes the significance of such outdoor private spaces in apartment buildings and puts forward balconies as an essential element of future dwellings design for the multiple benefits they behold. Originality/value: The originality of the study stems from tackling such a timely and unprecedented situation, where still few studies investigating the relationship between pandemic and the architecture of homes have been conducted. Furthermore, this study focuses particularly on exploring the use of balconies in Cairo, one of the largest cities in both Africa and the Middle East, during lockdown. Its findings might ultimately help formulate, define and characterize new trends in the architecture of homes that would embrace human needs in times of prosperity and rising tensions alike. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Balconies during COVID-19 lockdown: exploring the change in patterns of use in Cairo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antiviral medications are being given empirically to some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To support the development of a COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30, 2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS: In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. INTERPRETATION: To date, persuasive evidence of important benefit in COVID-19 does not exist for any antiviral treatments, although for each treatment evidence has not excluded important benefit. Additional randomized controlled trials involving patients with COVID-19 will be needed before such treatments can be administered with confidence.","output":"Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment for COVID-19 from evidence in studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other acute viral infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant portions of the world's forests have been impacted by severe and large-scale tree declines characterised by gradual but widespread loss of vigour and subsequent death of either single or several tree species. Tree deaths represent a threat for fauna that are dependent on forest habitats for their survival. Although tree declines have received considerable scientific attention, surprisingly, little is known about their impacts on fauna. In total, we calculated 631 effect sizes across 59 studies that quantified the impact of tree declines on animal abundance. Data representing 186 bird species indicated an overall increase in bird abundance in response to tree declines (meta-analysis mean  estimation g = 0.172  0.053 [CI 0.069 to 0.275], P = 0.001); however, there was substantial variability in responses (significant heterogeneity P < 0.001) with a strong influence of diet as well as nesting guild on bird responses. Granivores (especially ground-foraging species, e.g. Passerellidae species), bark-foraging insectivores (e.g. woodpeckers), as well as ground- and cavity-nesting species apparently benefitted from tree declines, while nectarivorous birds [and, although not significant, aerially foraging insectivores (e.g. flycatchers) and leaf-gleaning insectivores (canopy-feeding)] were less common in the presence of tree declines. Data representing 33 mammal species indicate a tendency for detrimental effects of tree declines on mammals that use trees as refuges, while aerial foragers (i.e. bats) may benefit from opening up the canopy. Overall the average effect for mammals was neutral (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.150  0.145 [-0.433 to 0.134], P = 0.302). Data representing 20 reptile species showed an insufficient range of responses to determine any diet or foraging effect on their responses. Data for 28 arthropod taxa should be considered with caution, as we could not adequately separate taxa according to their specialisations and reliance on key habitat. The data broadly suggest a detrimental effect of tree declines (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.171  0.072 [-0.311 to -0.031], P = 0.017) with ground-foraging arthropods (e.g. detritivores and predators such as spiders and centipedes) more likely to be detrimentally impacted by tree declines. The range of responses to tree declines signifies substantially altered animal communities. In many instances, altered ecosystem function due to loss of key animal services will represent a significant threat to forest health.","output":"Global meta-analysis of tree decline impacts on fauna."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The timely detection of metastatic infectious foci in gram-positive bacteremia is crucial, because these foci often require prolonged antibiotic treatment or drainage. The diagnosis of metastatic infectious foci is difficult because localizing symptoms are often absent. We investigated whether (18)F-FDG PET/CT was able to detect such foci and whether detection influenced clinical outcome. METHODS One hundred fifteen nonneutropenic patients with gram-positive bacteremia were prospectively included. Patients with positive blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, or Enterococcus species were eligible when a risk factor for developing metastatic infectious foci was present. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed within 2 wk after the first positive blood culture. Abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake had to be confirmed by radiologic, microbiologic, or pathologic studies. Results were compared with a matched historical control group of 230 patients in whom no (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed. RESULTS Significantly more patients were diagnosed with metastatic foci in the study group (67.8% vs. 35.7%). Of the imaging investigations performed, (18)F-FDG PET/CT was the first to delineate infectious foci in 35 patients (30%). In the remaining 70%, either symptoms on physical examination or other imaging techniques first revealed infectious foci. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 100%, 87%, 100%, and 89%, respectively. Relapse rates decreased from 7.4% to 2.6% among study patients (P = 0.09) and from 8.9% to 1.4% in patients with S. aureus (P = 0.04).

As part of these calls, our team asked why patients/families did not call 911. The purpose of this study was to determine if the COVID-19 crisis influenced the reasons why 911 was not called for possible stroke to better plan for targeted stroke education. Method: Discharge phone survey data from our stroke network was collected from Feb-Jul 2019 and compared to Feb-Jul 2020. Our stroke network includes 1 comprehensive stroke center and 2 primary stroke centers. Emergency Department (ED) stroke activation data was gathered for the same time periods. Discharge phone calls data was based on discharge date, whereas ED stroke alert data was based on admission date. Results: There was a notable decline in stroke volume between 2019 to 2020 with the largest decline occurring during the first peak (Apr 2020) in COVID-19 cases within our state. This decline was driven by a 16% decline in walk-in ED stroke arrivals as compared to a 1% decline in EMS stroke arrivals.

We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The two arms of the study included: 1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment, and 2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination (5CD) to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on three N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and two medical mask (MM) models. We inoculated FFR and MM materials with three coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and treated with 10 M MB and exposed to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5CD using multiple US and international test methods and compared to the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all three coronaviruses with 99.8 - to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and MMs tested.

We analyzed two sets of transcriptomic data of SARS-CoV-2 infection obtained from lung epithelium cells and PBMCs, and two sets of T2D data from pancreatic islet cells and PBMCs to identify the associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) followed by their functional enrichment analyses in terms of protein-protein interaction (PPI) to detect hub-proteins and associated comorbidities, transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as the potential drug candidates. In PPI analysis, four potential hub-proteins (i.e., BIRC3, C3, MME, and IL1B) were identified among 25 DEGs shared between the disease pair. Enrichment analyses using the mutually overlapped DEGs revealed the most prevalent GO and cell signalling pathways, including TNF signalling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and IL-17 signalling, which are related to cytokine activities. Furthermore, as significant TFs, we identified IRF1, KLF11, FOSL1, and CREB3L1 while miRNAs including miR-1-3p, 34a-5p, 16-5p, 155-5p, 20a-5p, and let-7b-5p were found to be noteworthy. The findings illustrated the significant association between COVID-19 and T2D at the molecular level. These genetic determinants can further be explored for their specific roles in disease progression and therapeutic intervention, while significant pathways can also be studied as molecular checkpoints. Finally, the identified drug candidates may be evaluated for their potency to minimize the severity of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing T2D.","output":"Identifying Molecular Insight of Synergistic Complexities for SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Pre-existing Type 2 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-stimuli- responsive mechanical strong stretchable hydrogel has grabbed extensive attention in recent years.

Their epidemiologies and clinical characteristics are poorly described and are often reliant on case reports. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale comprehensive screening for all four coronaviruses by analysis of 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, over 3 years between July 2006 and June 2009 using a novel four-way multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Coronaviruses were detected in 0.3 to 0.85% of samples in all age groups. Generally, coronaviruses displayed marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and were not detected in summer months, which is comparable to the pattern seen with influenza viruses. HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year. There were additional longer-term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV-OC43 predominant in the first and third seasons and HCoV-HKU1 dominating in the second (see Results for definitions of seasons). A total of 11 to 41% of coronaviruses detected were in samples testing positive for other respiratory viruses, although clinical presentations of coronavirus monoinfections were comparable to those of viruses which have an established role in respiratory disease, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses. The novel multiplex assay for real-time pan-coronavirus detection enhances respiratory virus diagnosis, overcomes potential diagnostic problems arising through seasonal variation in coronavirus frequency, and provides novel insights into the epidemiology and clinical implications of coronaviruses.","output":"Epidemiology and clinical presentations of the four human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 detected over 3 years using a novel multiplex real-time PCR method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection elicits an antibody response that targets several viral proteins including spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N); S is the major target of neutralizing antibodies.

Specifically, we examine neutralization and anti-N binding by sera collected up to 52 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and compare these to a cohort of adults, including older adults, most of whom had mild infections that did not require hospitalization. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in children than adults early after infection, but by 6 months titers were similar between age groups. The neutralizing activity of the childrens sera decreased modestly from one to six months; a pattern that was not significantly different from that observed in adults. However, infection of children induced much lower levels of anti-N antibodies than in adults, and levels of these anti-N antibodies decreased more rapidly in children than in adults, including older adults.

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicentre, cross-sectional study comprising 1,309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% CI=25.01%-29.85%). Women who were worried about themselves or their babies being infected with COVID-19 (OR=2.562, 95%CI=1.670-3.929), and those who had delayed regular medical check-ups (OR=2.434, 95%CI=1.580-3.750) were at higher risk of depression.

Objective To determine the spatial pattern of road traffic injury during the 7-day Songkran holiday in Thailand. Method This study utilized the data obtained from the Information Technology for Emergency Medical System (ITEMS) covering the nationwide road traffic injury during the Songkran festival, Thai New Year holiday (April 9-15, 2015). The Moran's I was used to identify global autocorrelation within the country whereas the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis was administered for analyzing the spatial distribution of RTIs and determining the spatial autocorrelation and correlation of numbers motor vehicles and length of road networks and road traffic injury. Result During Songkran holiday 2015, the univariate Moran's I of RTIs distribution among provinces in Thailand showed a slightly positive spatial autocorrelation, as the Moran's I was 0.1701, with statistical significance at 0.05. Local indicators of spatial association indicated seven hotspots and five cold spots. In addition, the number of motor vehicles, and length of trunk road (super highway), tertiary roads, secondary roads, and primary roads had positive spatial autocorrelation with road traffic injury, with Moran's I values of 0.173, 0.117, 0.219, 0.162, and 0.279, respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrates that local indicators of spatial association could detect the spatial pattern of road traffic injury.

The lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks. Some investors predict that China's real estate bubble will soon burst as the property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita and as the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. This is expected to cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. Even with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices is expected to induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a harmonious society.","output":"The Chinese Real Estate Bubble: Is It an Opportunity for Short Selling?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucosinolates (GSs) are sulfur-containing secondary metabolites characteristic of cruciferous plants [1, 2]. Their breakdown products, isothiocyanates (ITCs), are released following tissue disruption by insect feeding or other mechanical damages [3, 4]. ITCs repel and are toxic to generalist herbivores, while specialist herbivores utilize the volatile ITCs as key signals for localizing host plants [5, 6]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying detection of ITCs remain open. Here, we report that in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, a crucifer specialist, ITCs indeed drive the host preference for Arabidopsis thaliana, and the two olfactory receptors Or35 and Or49 are essential for this behavior. By performing gene expression analyses, we identified 12 (out of 59 in total) female-biased Ors, suggesting their possible involvement in oviposition choice. By ectopically expressing these Ors in Xenopus oocytes and screening their responses with 49 odors (including 13 ITCs, 25 general plant volatiles, and 11 sex pheromone components), we found that Or35 and Or49 responded specifically to three ITCs (iberverin, 4-pentenyl ITC, and phenylethyl ITC). The same ITCs also exhibited highest activity in electroantennogram recordings with female antennae and were the strongest oviposition stimulants. Knocking out either Or35 or Or49 via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a reduced oviposition preference for the ITCs, while double Or knockout females lost their ITC preference completely and were unable to choose between wild-type A. thaliana and a conspecific ITC knockout plant. We hence conclude that the ITC-based oviposition preference of the diamondback moth for its host A. thaliana is governed by the cooperation of two highly specific olfactory receptors.","output":"The Molecular Basis of Host Selection in a Crucifer-Specialized Moth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dire need for safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines is met with many vaccine candidates being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

As a result, the need for a working knowledge of tracheostomy care by many levels of care providers has soared. There are short and long term complications associated with tracheostomies. Multi-disciplinary team training for tracheostomy care may improve the care of these patients. METHODS: Medicine residents were given a pre-survey questionnaire to test their baseline knowledge on tracheostomies, understanding of available resources and comfort levels with dealing with day to day care and emergencies. Afterwards, a pre-test was given on knowledge about tracheostomies and daily/emergency management. Subsequently, they were given an educational presentation on tracheostomy selection, special COVID considerations, daily care and emergency troubleshooting. After completion of the education portion, residents underwent simulation lab training, comprising 4 stations: basic care;bleeding tracheostomy;accidental decannulation and tracheostomy obstruction. Residents were then re-tested to assess improvement in knowledge with plans to re-test in 6 months to monitor retention. RESULTS: Pre/Post survey results showed improvement in questions related to which service to call if there is a tracheostomy issue (69.9% to 92.3%), how to find tracheostomy specifics in the electronic medical record (13% to 61.5%), usefulness of a tracheostomy chart above the head of the bed (95.6% to 100%) and if tracheostomy emergency kits in each room were useful (91% to 100%). Pre/Post testing on the didactic and hands-on curriculum were administered. The pre-test results, no one passed as scores ranged 34-68 % out of a possible score of 100%. Post-test, everyone improved their scores with 75 % of learners passing the post test exam scoring 85-100%. Average test scores prior to lecture and simulation lab was 44%, compared to post test average of 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Residents increased their knowledge and awareness about tracheostomies as seen through improvements in all categories within testing. Residents favored specific educational scenarios about tracheostomy emergencies to delineate team training, roles and algorithms for care and in person training over online modules. This curriculum on tracheostomy troubleshooting and care can be operationalized for a wide array of team based multi-disciplinary providers throughout the spectrum of care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Standardized curriculum with clear objectives coupled with hands-on team training along with pre and post knowledge assessments can be readily implemented during a global pandemic. Further follow up assessments will be needed to determine if long term knowledge retention translates to sustained bedside benefit.

But in the numerosity discrimination tasks, almost half of the subjects gave a significant number of fast guesses and/or unstable RTs across the session. Diffusion model parameters were largely consistent with the earlier studies as were correlations across tasks and correlations with IQ and age. One surprising result was that eliminating fast outliers from subjects with highly variable RTs (those eliminated from the main analyses) produced diffusion model analyses that showed patterns of correlations similar to the subjects with stable performance. Methods for displaying data to examine stability, eliminating subjects, and implementing RT data collection on AMT including checks on timing are also discussed.","output":"Do data from mechanical Turk subjects replicate accuracy, response time, and diffusion modeling results?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis, a condition in which the bloodstream is fighting a systemic infection, is a major health concern in both developed and developing countries.","output":"Biomaterial and Therapeutic Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged the medical community to characterize and treat a new illness. Now almost two years after the initial confirmed cases of COVID-19, medical teams are faced with another unique disease process temporally related to the pandemic-multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The comparison of these patients presentations illustrates the new challenges of evaluating a pediatric rash and fever in the era of MIS-C. Case Reports: This report presents three cases with features of MIS-C, positivity for SARS-CoV-2, rashes, fevers, gastrointestinal involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. The first case poses a diagnostic dilemma. While the case 1 patient has many features of MIS-C, his nasal swab was positive for Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA). While the second case falls into the case definition of MIS-C, the case 2 patient also met the criteria for atypical Kawasaki disease. Although the third case was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the patient comparatively had a mild elevation of inflammatory markers and a stable clinical course led the treatment team to be more suspicious of immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis versus hand, foot, and mouth disease. The variability in skin rash in patients with MIS-C contributes to the challenge of correctly diagnosing and managing pediatric patients with fever and rash in the emergency department (ED). Conclusion: Although most children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or present with mild respiratory illness, it is critical to recognize children at-risk for fluid-refractory shock in MIS-C. With the continuing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, emergency department (ED) providers will have to be alert and have high suspicion when evaluating a child with a fever and a rash to properly identify children presenting with this serious illness.","output":"Challenges in Evaluating Pediatric Fever and Rash in the Era of COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Language education in higher education has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, and this has placed significant pressure on practitioners around the world irrespective of their respective experience prior to the pandemic.

Drawing on Survival Psychology and Maslow's motivation theories, this study introduced a theoretical model to establish the factors affecting consumers' PB and investigate their interrelationships. An online survey was designed and administered to 508 respondents in Singapore. Then, structural equation modelling was implemented to study the survey data. The results indicated that the effects of several constructs namely, normative social influence, observational learning, perceived severity, and perceived scarcity, with mediation by control, impose significant influence on consumers' PB. Analysis of total effects showed that normative social influence has the strongest effect on PB. This is followed by perceived scarcity, control, social trust, observational learning, and perceived severity. Two diverse research paradigms centring on Survival Psychology and Maslow's motivation theories were integrated to offer a logical explanation of the motivation driving PB. By utilising a theory-driven approach, the current study has offered a unique approach to interpreting consumers' PB.

We aimed to compare one method, Interactive Spaced Education (ISE/QI), with standard (STD/QI) education embedded within a constipation management QI initiative. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled study to compare ISE/QI and STD/QI education. Pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) were recruited from a network of local private practices. The QI initiative was implemented with all providers before education interventions. ISE/QI participants received questions by email weekly, provided answers, received feedback, and repeated questions over a 4-month period. The STD/QI group received a Power Point with the same educational content. Pre- and post-surveys evaluated usability, self-assessed confidence, and practice changes while quizzes evaluated knowledge. Process control charts tracked subsequent visits to gastroenterology (GI). RESULTS Of the 212 eligible PCPs, 101 (48%) enrolled, with 49 PCPs in the ISE/QI arm and 52 in STD/QI education arm. Quiz scores improved in the ISE/QI arm with a strong effect size (Cohen d 1.76). Mean increase in confidence managing difficult cases was higher in the ISE/QI group (1.84 vs 1.21, p = 0.030). ISE/QI participants were more likely to rate the activity better than most online education (OR 18.1, p < 0.0001) and incorporate practice changes (OR 3.35, p = 0.0152). Visits to GI decreased among the entire population, but the effect on GI visits within each education arm was mixed. CONCLUSIONS ISE/QI improved knowledge and confidence managing difficult cases.

This study aims to compare 2 established methods of EJ anastomosis in LTG. Materials and Methods A total of 314 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer that underwent LTG in the period from January 2013 to October 2016 were enrolled in the study. In 254 patients, the circular stapler with purse-string \\"Lap-Jack\\" method was used, and in the other 60 patients the linear stapling method was used for EJ anastomosis. After propensity score matching, 58 were matched 1:1, and retrospective data for patient characteristics, surgical outcome, and post-operative complications was reviewed. Results The 2 groups showed no significant difference in age, body mass index, or other clinicopathological characteristics. After propensity score matching analysis, the linear group had shorter operating time than the circular group (200.362.0 vs. 244.065.5, P0.001). Early postoperative complications in the circular and linear groups occurred in 12 (20.7%) and 15 (25.9%, P=0.660) patients, respectively. EJ leakage occurred in 3 (5.2%) patients from each group, with 1 patient from each group needing intervention of Clavien-Dindo grade III or more.

However, the drug-resistant strains of pathogens continuously emerge, and medical treatments are often ineffective. Moreover, there is increasing public objections to drug residues in poultry products. The other important type of control is the vaccination which depends on immunity. This immunological control is the major practical alternative to chemotherapy. Success of vaccines in combating poultry diseases depends mainly on the choice of the proper type of vaccines, correct time of its usage, and method of administration. The types of vaccines include attenuated live vaccines, and these vaccines were shown to be effective in inducing protection. The second type is killed vaccine or whole bacteria extracts which is less successful in providing protection compared to live vaccines. The metabolic product vaccine (toxoids) is the third type of vaccine. The recombinant DNA technique was adopted to produce the protective antigens in a sufficient amount and in cost-effective ways. CONCLUSIONS: Protection studies against bacterial diseases were performed by using several trials: living vaccines (live attenuated vaccines; live, non-pathogenic microorganisms; live, low virulence microorganism), inactivated (killed) vaccines (heat-inactivated, chemical inactivates, radiation), metabolic product vaccines (toxoids), subunit vaccines (whole cell proteins, outer membrane proteins, purified flagellar proteins (flagellin), fimbrial proteins, pilus proteins, lipopolysaccharides), vaccines produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, and DNA vaccines.","output":"Bacterial vaccines in poultry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work proposes and analyzes the use of keystroke biometrics for content de-anonymization. Fake news have become a powerful tool to manipulate public opinion, especially during major events. In particular, the massive spread of fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments and companies to fight against missinformation. In this context, the ability to link multiple accounts or profiles that spread such malicious content on the Internet while hiding in anonymity would enable proactive identification and blacklisting. Behavioral biometrics can be powerful tools in this fight. In this work, we have analyzed how the latest advances in keystroke biometric recognition can help to link behavioral typing patterns in experiments involving 100,000 users and more than 1 million typed sequences. Our proposed system is based on Recurrent Neural Networks adapted to the context of content de-anonymization. Assuming the challenge to link the typed content of a target user in a pool of candidate profiles, our results show that keystroke recognition can be used to reduce the list of candidate profiles by more than 90%. In addition, when keystroke is combined with auxiliary data (such as location), our system achieves a Rank-1 identification performance equal to 52.6% and 10.9% for a background candidate list composed of 1K and 100K profiles, respectively.","output":"Keystroke Biometrics in Response to Fake News Propagation in a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although numerous studies have investigated obesity's negative effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, only a limited number focused on this association in diabetic patients In this study, we analyzed the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcome (death, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation needs, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [qSOFA] score, and confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure [CURB-65] scores) for hospitalized diabetic patients Methods: In this prospective hospital-based registry of patients with COVID-19 in East Azerbaijan, Iran, 368 consecutive diabetic patients with COVID-19 were followed from admission until discharge or death Self-reported weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (kg/m2) upon admission Our primary endpoint was analyzing obesity and COVID-19 mortality association Assessing the associations among obesity and disease severity, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation was our secondary endpoint Results: We analyzed data from 317 patients and found no significant difference between obese and non-obese patients regarding frequency of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, CURB-65, or qSOFA scores (P&gt;0 05) After adjusting for confounding factors, obese diabetic COVID-19 patients were 2 72 times more likely to die than non-obese patients Moreover, ventilator dependence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1 87;95% confidence interval [CI], 1 03-4 76) and ICU admission (aOR, 2 41;95% CI, 1 11-5 68) odds were significantly higher for obese patients than non-obese patients Conclusion: The results of the present study indicated that obesity worsens health outcomes for diabetic COVID-19 patients","output":"Diabesity Associated with Poor COVID-19 Outcomes among Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, multiple promising treatment modalities have been tested, however, only several of them were proven to be effective.

Methods: To investigate a possible role of TPE in severe COVID-19 we used a structured systematic search strategy to retrieve all relevant publications in the field. We screened in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and clinicaltrials.gov for data published until the 4 June 2021. Results: We identified 18 papers, enrolling 384 patients, 220 of whom received TPE. The number of TPE sessions ranged from 1 to 9 and the type of replacement fluid varied markedly between studies (fresh frozen plasma or 5% albumin solution, or convalescent plasma). Biochemical improvement was observed in majority of studies as far as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer concentrations and lymphocyte count are concerned. The improvement at a laboratory level was associated with enhancement of respiratory function. Adverse effects were limited to five episodes of transient hypotension and one femoral artery puncture and thrombophlebitis. Conclusions: Although the effect of therapeutic plasma exchange on mortality remains unclarified, the procedure seems to improve various secondary end-points such as PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio or biomarkers of inflammation.

This paper furthers these historical considerations of the current pandemic by examining the way the National Health Service (NHS) and discourses of risk have figured in public and policy responses. It suggests that appeals to protect the NHS are based on longer-term anxieties about the services capacity to care and endure in the face of growing demand, as well as building on the attachment that has developed as a result of this persistence in the face of existential threats. Similarly, the position of elderly, vulnerable and at risk patients relates to complex histories in which their place in social and medical hierarchies have been ambiguous. It thus argues that the ways in which time appears as both a threat and a possibility of management in the current crisis form part of a longer trajectory of political and cultural thinking.","output":"Historicising containment and delay: COVID-19, the NHS and high-risk patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic led to a complete renewal of clinical activities of Italian hospitals. During the lockdown, all hospitals in Italy had to suspend non-urgent clinical activities. The prolonged suspension of elective activities could have caused a series of problems. METHODS: A new ad hoc protocol was designed. Single-day fast-imaging protocol with regadenoson-stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin imaging was preferred. Patients were contacted by phone 4 days before the test and answered to a questionnaire which will be repeated on the day of the exam. Body temperature <37.5 degrees C and no Covid-19 symptoms were necessary to enter the unit. Patients wore surgical mask and gloves. Social distancing was maintained throughout the examination. Healthcare professionals wore a personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were studied from April 7 to May 15, 2020, before the publication of the recommendations from ASNC and SNMMI. None of the patients experienced complications. Follow-up of patients discharged was carried by phone. No Covid-19 infection symptoms were reported.

Less than 5% of engineering students graduated during the 2020 academic year as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. 100% of both undergraduate and postgraduate graduated students were from PU because FU and SU lack the basic facilities to embark on online teaching and to conduct online examination. This further justified the demands from the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) on the need for the government to fund FU and SU adequately and functionally. Engineering students in Nigerian universities have no access to laboratories and research centres. The study has helped us to determine the extent of engineering educational training vulnerability. In conclusion, the government, all other stakeholders and international communities should invest adequate resources to eliminate engineering education challenges to guarantee a sustainable national and global economic development. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Evaluation of engineering students output during covid-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Analyses of blood biomarkers involved in the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection can reveal distinct biological pathways and inform development and testing of therapeutics for COVID-19. Our objective was to evaluate host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 171 ICU patients, including 78 (46%) patients positive and 93 (54%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. We compared 22 plasma biomarkers in blood collected within 24 h and 3 days after ICU admission. RESULTS: In critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the most common ICU admission diagnoses were respiratory failure or pneumonia, followed by sepsis and other diagnoses. Similar proportions of patients in both groups received invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of study enrollment. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients had similar rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe acute kidney injury, and in-hospital mortality. While concentrations of interleukin 6 and 8 were not different between groups, markers of epithelial cell injury (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, sRAGE) and acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A, SAA) were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19, adjusting for demographics and APACHE III scores. In contrast, angiopoietin 2:1 (Ang-2:1 ratio) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, were significantly lower in COVID-19 (p < 0.002). Ang-2:1 ratio and SAA were associated with mortality only in non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that, unlike other well-studied causes of critical illness, endothelial dysfunction may not be characteristic of severe COVID-19 early after ICU admission. Pathways resulting in elaboration of acute phase proteins and inducing epithelial cell injury may be promising targets for therapeutics in COVID-19.","output":"Comparison of host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory response in ICU patients with and without COVID-19: a prospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen.

While standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody, antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective. Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.","output":"Tracking disease outbreaks from sparse data with Bayesian inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan's college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD: The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS: The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on pertussis epidemiology and burden of disease in South Korea. The objective was to highlight evidence gaps which could help improve awareness about pertussis disease in adults in South Korea. RESULTS: Of 940 articles published between January 2000 to December 2019, 19 articles provided data for pertussis epidemiology and 9 provided data in adults. Laboratory confirmation rates in adults varied according to methodology, likely influenced by study/sampling variations. Three studies reported serological evidence of infection in adolescents and adults (33-57%). Among cases, the average cough duration was 16.5 days (range 7-30 days) and over 85% of cases presented with paroxysmal cough, while only 25% of cases or less presented with a characteristic whoop or post-tussive vomiting. Importantly, in 4 studies reporting vaccination status, almost all adult cases had no history of pertussis vaccination since childhood. CONCLUSION: Primary childhood vaccination rates in South Korea are among the highest globally, while adult pertussis vaccine uptake appears to be quite low. Our literature review suggests that pertussis is underreported in adults, as evidenced by serology data demonstrating that tetanus antibody levels are low while pertussis toxin antibody levels are relatively high, suggesting continued circulation of community pertussis. These findings highlight the need for strategies such as maternal immunization and decennial revaccination of adults to address the changing epidemiology and waning immunity. Active pertussis testing/reporting and better utilization of adult vaccine registries is required to help provide robust data for vaccine decision-making at the national level. In the current COVID-19 environment, strategies that can reduce clinic or hospital visits will have substantial benefits to authorities managing rapid increases in health care resource utilization, and vaccine preventable diseases provide an easy and immediate target for achieving that goal.

Quantification of skeletal muscle is of interest owing to its association with clinical outcomes. However, the standards of precision testing considered mandatory in other areas of radiology are lacking from the literature in this area. We aim to describe the change in skeletal muscle over time at different anatomical levels using the precision error. METHODS: Thirty-eight male patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were evaluated at two time points encompassing their treatment plan. Precision testing consisted of analyzing the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the skeletal muscle and total adipose tissue of 76 CT studies (38 images at baseline repeated twice and 38 follow-up images repeated twice) measured by a skilled observer. The % coefficient of variation (%CV), the root-mean-square standard deviation (RMS SD) and the corresponding 95% least significant change (LSC) were calculated for four anatomical levels: upper arm, thigh, chest and abdomen. RESULTS: The median time between scans was 223.6 (SD 31.2) days. Precision error (% CV) for total skeletal muscle cross sectional area was 0.86% for upper arm, 0.26% for thigh, 0.39% for chest and 0.63% for abdomen. The corresponding LSC values in upper arm, thigh, chest and abdomen were 2.4%, 0.7%, 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Based on the LSC for RMS SD, patients were classified in two categories according to muscle cross-sectional area: stable (i.e within LSC value) or gained and loss. To compare the four anatomical levels, the proportion of patients with muscle loss exceeding the LSC value was 74.3% for arm, 86.2% for thigh, 82.9% for chest and 76.3% for abdomen. For these same anatomic regions, the mean muscle loss for those patients classified below the LSC was 14.6% (SD 9.3), 13.4% (SD 7.8), 11.9% (SD 6.5) and 11.6% (SD 5.5), respectively. Only the loss of muscle area was significantly higher in thigh (p = 0.023), using L3 as the reference level. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the uniform use of a standard precision test when reporting muscle change over time. LSC values vary from 0.7 to 2.4% depending on anatomic site; with the lowest precision error to detect change in the thigh. Based on this analysis, muscle wasting appears to be systemic and while present in limbs and trunk is significantly higher in the thigh than in the chest, abdomen or upper arm.","output":"Assessing dynamic change in muscle during treatment of patients with cancer: Precision testing standards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teaching strategies need to swiftly respond to abrupt changes in delivery modes that provide engaging and effective experiences for learners.

Calculated MP, the product of applied airway pressure and minute ventilation, may serve as an estimate of respiratory muscle workload when switching to spontaneous breathing. The aim of the study was to assess MPs discriminatory performance in predicting successful weaning from prolonged tracheostomy ventilation. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in 130 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients in a specialized weaning center. Predictive weaning outcome ability of arterial blood gas analyses and indices derived from calculated MP at beginning and end of weaning was determined in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and measures derived from k-fold cross-validation (likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, F(1) score, and Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC]). RESULTS: Forty-four (33.8%) patients experienced weaning failure. Absolute MP showed poor discrimination in predicting outcome; whereas specific MP (MP normalized to dynamic lung-thorax compliance, LTC(dyn)-MP) had moderate diagnostic accuracy (MCC 0.38; AUROC 0.79, 95%CI [0.71?0.86], p < 0.001), further improved by correction for corresponding mechanical ventilation P(a)CO(2) (termed the power index of the respiratory system [PI(rs)]: MCC 0.52; AUROC 0.86 [0.79?0.92], p < 0.001).

A total of 459 parents (M(age) = 40; 98.7% female) completed self-reported questionnaires at two-time points to assess the predictive role of mindfulness on parental burnout, self-compassion and rumination type, and the mediating role of self-compassion and rumination type in the relation between mindfulness and parental burnout. Results showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination type at Time 1 predicted levels of parental burnout at Time 2.

METHODS Subjects were  18 years old and underwent elective open, laparoscopic or RAS VIH repair without myofascial release. Perioperative clinical outcomes through 30 days were analyzed as were prescription pain medication use and subject-reported responses to the HerQLes Abdominal QOL questionnaire. Observed differences in baseline characteristics were controlled using a weighted propensity score analysis to obviate potential selection bias (inverse probability of treatment weighting, IPTW). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-one subjects (RAS, n = 159; open, n = 130; laparoscopic, n = 82) were enrolled in the study across 17 medical institutions within the United States. Operative times were significantly different between the RAS and laparoscopic groups (126.2 vs 57.2, respectively; p < 0.001). Mean length of stay was comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (1.4  1.0 vs 1.4  1.1, respectively; p = 0.623) and differed for the RAS vs open groups (1.4  1.0 vs 2.0  1.9, respectively; p < 0.001). Conversion rates differed between RAS and laparoscopic groups (0.6% vs 4.9%; p = 0.004). The number of subjects reporting the need to take prescription pain medication through the 2-4 weeks visit differed between RAS vs open (65.2% vs 79.8%; p < 0.001) and RAS vs laparoscopic (65.2% vs 78.75%; p < 0.001). For those taking prescription pain medication, the mean number of pills taken was comparable for RAS vs open (23.3 vs 20.4; p = 0.079) and RAS vs laparoscopic (23.3 vs 23.3; p = 0.786). Times to return to normal activities and to work, complication rates and HerQLes QOL scores were comparable for the RAS vs open and RAS vs laparoscopic groups. The reoperation rate within 30 days post-procedure was comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (0.6% vs 0%; p = 0.296) and differed for RAS vs open (0.6% vs 3.1%; p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Short-term outcomes indicate that open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches are effective surgical approaches to VIH repair; however, each repair technique may demonstrate advantages in terms of clinical outcomes. Observed differences in the RAS vs laparoscopic comparison are longer operative time and lower conversion rate in the RAS group. Observed differences in the RAS vs open comparison are shorter LOS and lower reoperation rate through 30 days in the RAS group. The operative time in the RAS vs open comparison is similar. The number of subjects requiring the use of prescription pain medication favored the RAS group in both comparisons; however, among subjects reporting a need for pain medication, there was no difference in the number of prescription pain medication pills taken. While the study adds to the body of evidence evaluating the open, laparoscopic, and RAS approaches, future controlled studies are needed to better understand pain and QOL outcomes related to incisional hernia repair.

Sensitivity of the Ag-RDT in this setting was 40% (95% CI: 30.3%, 50.3%); most false negatives had high cycle threshold values (>25), hence low viral loads. Over 80% of participants who tested positive completed a 2-week phone-based follow-up questionnaire. Overall, the digital tool combined with Ag-RDTs enhanced community-based decentralized COVID-19 testing service delivery, reporting and follow-up.","output":"Monitored Implementation of COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Screening at Taxi Ranks in Johannesburg, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients on dialysis are at risk of severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the neutralizing activity and coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants of vaccine-elicited antibodies is required to guide prophylactic and therapeutic COVID-19 interventions in this frail population. By analyzing plasma samples from 130 hemodialysis (HD) and 13 peritoneal dialysis patients after two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, we found that 35% of the patients had low-level or undetectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S). Neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant were low or undetectable in 49% and 77% of patients, respectively, and were further reduced against other emerging variants. The fraction of non-responding patients was higher in SARS-CoV-2-naive HD patients immunized with BNT162b2 (66%) than those immunized with mRNA-1273 (23%). The reduced neutralizing activity correlated with low antibody avidity, consistent with a delayed affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells.

Although the emergence of infectious diseases and their subsequent spread have a significant impact on global health and economics, a comprehensive literature evaluation of this topic has yet to be carried out. Thus, the current study encompasses the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature evaluation and classification of the fuzzy logic methods in infectious diseases. 40 papers on this topic, which have been published from 2005 to 2019 and related to the human infectious diseases were evaluated and analyzed. The findings of this evaluation clearly show that the fuzzy logic methods are vastly used for diagnosis of diseases such as dengue fever, hepatitis and tuberculosis. The key fuzzy logic methods used for the infectious disease are the fuzzy inference system; the rule-based fuzzy logic, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and fuzzy cognitive map. Furthermore, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were universally applied for a performance evaluation of the fuzzy logic techniques. This thesis will also address the various needs between the different industries, practitioners and researchers to encourage more research regarding the more overlooked areas, and it will conclude with several suggestions for the future infectious disease researches.","output":"Fuzzy logic approach for infectious disease diagnosis: A methodical evaluation, literature and classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Recognition of the pattern of FDG uptake in hypermetabolic axillary lymph nodes (HALs) and association with recent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination are important to prevent patient anxiety and further needless examinations or costly biopsies in cancer patients.

We investigate the occurrence and pattern of HAL on FDG PET/CT scans from 650 consecutive cancer patients with recent BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS Between December 20, 2020, and February 8, 2021, 650 patients (351 female patients [54%]; mean age, 68.9 years) had recent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and an FDG PET/CT scan. HALs were found in 57 (14.5%) of 394 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9%-18.7%) 12.3  5.9 (1-22) days after dose 1 and in 111 (43.3%) of 256 patients (95% CI, 35.3%-52.2%; P < 0.0001) after 7.5  5.4 (1-22) days after dose 2.

Levels of antibodies that bound a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, neutralizing antibody titers and memory B-cell expansion correlated with each other across vaccine platforms. Nevertheless, the vaccines elicited variable levels of B-cell immunity, and the majority of recipients had undetectable neutralizing activity against the recently emergent omicron variant. SARS-CoV-2 infection, experienced prior to or after vaccination potentiated B-cell immune responses and enabled the generation of neutralizing activity against omicron and SARS-CoV for all vaccines in nearly all individuals.

This necessitates the development of rapid genetic surveillance methodologies to serve as an adjunct with existing comprehensive, albeit though slower, genome sequencing-driven approaches. METHODS: A total of 21,789 complete genomes were downloaded from GISAID on May 28, 2020 for analyses. We have defined the major clades and subclades of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A rapid sequencing-based genotyping protocol was developed and tested on SARS-CoV-2-positive RNA samples by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: We describe 11 major mutations which defined five major clades (G(614), S(84), V(251), I(378) and D(392)) of globally circulating viral populations. The clades can specifically identify using an 11-nucleotide genetic barcode. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host entry and genome replication. CONCLUSION: Globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 5 major clades based on mutational profiles defined by an 11-nucleotide barcode. We have successfully developed a multiplexed sequencing-based, rapid genotyping protocol for high-throughput classification of major clade types of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples.

Carpachromene is a natural active compound that inhibits -glucosidase enzyme. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential activity of carpachromene on glucose consumption, metabolism and insulin signalling in a HepG2 cells insulin resistant model. A HepG2 insulin resistant cell model (HepG2/IRM) was established. Cell viability assay of HepG2/IRM cells was performed after carpachromene/metformin treatment. Glucose concentration and glycogen content were determined. Western blot analysis of insulin receptor, IRS1, IRS2, PI3k, Akt, GSK3, FoxO1 proteins after carpachromene treatment was performed. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and hexokinase (HK) enzymes activity was also estimated. Viability of HepG2/IRM cells was over 90% after carpachromene treatment at concentrations 6.3, 10, and 20 g/mL. Treatment of HepG2/IRM cells with carpachromene decreased glucose concentration in a concentration- and time-dependant manner. In addition, carpachromene increased glycogen content of HepG2/IRM cells. Moreover, carpachromene treatment of HepG2/IRM cells significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated/total ratios of IR, IRS1, PI3K, Akt, GSK3, and FoxO1 proteins. Furthermore, PEPCK enzyme activity was significantly decreased, and HK enzyme activity was significantly increased after carpachromene treatment. The present study examined, for the first time, the potential antidiabetic activity of carpachromene on a biochemical and molecular basis. It increased the expression ratio of insulin receptor and IRS1 which further phosphorylated/activated PI3K/Akt pathway and phosphorylated/inhibited GSK3 and FoxO1 proteins.

Employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), this study examined the factor structure of the DASS-21 and five shortened versions of the DASS-21 among psychiatric patients (N = 168) and the general public (N = 992) during the COVID-19 confinement period in Saudi Arabia. Multigroup CFA, Mann Whitney W test, Spearmans correlation, and coefficient alpha were used to examine the shortened versions of the DASS-21 (DASS-13, DASS-12, DASS-9 (two versions), and DASS-8) for invariance across age and gender groups, discriminant validity, predictive validity, item coverage, and internal consistency, respectively. Compared with the DASS-21, all three-factor structures of the shortened versions expressed good fit, with the DASS-8 demonstrating the best fit and highest item loadings on the corresponding factors in both samples ((2)(16, 15) = 16.5, 67.0; p = 0.420, 0.001; CFI = 1.000, 0.998; TLI = 0.999, 0.997; RMSEA = 0.013, 0.059, SRMR = 0.0186, 0.0203). The DASS-8 expressed configural, metric, and scalar invariance across age and gender groups. Its internal consistency was comparable to other versions ( = 0.94). Strong positive correlations of the DASS-8 and its subscales with the DASS-21 and its subscales (r = 0.97 to 0.81) suggest adequate item coverage and good predictive validity of this version. The DASS-8 and its subscales distinguished the clinical sample from the general public at the same level of significance expressed by the DASS-21 and other shortened versions, supporting its discriminant validity. Neither the DASS-21 nor the shortened versions distinguished patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety from each other or from other psychiatric conditions. The DASS-8 represents a valid short version of the DASS-21, which may be useful in research and clinical practice for quick identification of individuals with potential psychopathologies.

Using a combination of virtual clinics and telephone triage assessments in a multi-professional team approach has allowed our haematuria pathway to continue to function. We reviewed how these interventions helped maintain the volume of patients through the haematuria service during the pandemic. Materials & Methods: We reviewed prospective audit data collected on patients referred to the haematuria service between June 2019 and January 2021. Comparison was made in respect to the pathways before and during the pandemic. Data review included: time from primary care referral to hospital clinical review, time from clinic to CT, ultrasound and/or flexible cystoscopy and time to bladder tumour resection. All patients were invited to complete an on-line survey to document their experiences and the results were reviewed. Results: 174 patients were referred via a two-week-wait cancer pathway (12 via internal pathways, 162 from primary care). Between 26/3/20 and 14/4/20 no referrals were received. Before the pandemic the number of referrals were 93 over 9 months (10.3 referrals per month), post-covid 81 referrals were sent over 9.5 months (8.5 referrals per month). 12 patients were not investigated in the usual timeframe (COVID positive, shielding, patient choice and non-attendance) and were excluded from final analysis. Of 162 patients, 51 were women, and 111 were men. The average age was 64.4 years (SD+/-14.51, range 20-91).

An equal number of patients were reviewed by nurses and doctors. Conclusions: The adaptation to our services may have resulted in several improvements, namely in the time frames of patients being seen and assessed.

The present expert opinion article aimed to identify unmet needs in the management of SA in Italy, and propose possible solutions to address these needs. METHODS: At five multidisciplinary events in Italy, attendees identified factors that interfered with the effective management of SA and suggested how these barriers could be overcome. A core group of 12 Italian experts (pulmonologists, general practitioners, allergists, payers and patients) identified the main issues and proposed possible solutions based on the results from the meetings and relevant articles from the literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed the gap between real-world practice and guidelines, oral corticosteroid overuse, SA-related mortality, and barriers to effective SA treatment. Common themes were lack of awareness about SA among both patients and clinicians, and lack of networking/information exchange between those involved in the treatment of SA. Participants agreed on the need to implement patient education and create multidisciplinary groups of specialists to improve SA management through multidisciplinary educational initiatives, meetings with local experts, development of a flow chart for referral/connection with local experts and specialized centers. Clinical instruments that might help specialists improve SA management included referral networks, integrated care pathways, phenotyping and treatment algorithms, exacerbation tracking, and examination of electronic medical records for patients with uncontrolled asthma. The following actions need to be implemented in Italy: i) maximize the use of advanced therapies, eg, biologics; ii) increase/improve education for physicians and patients; iii) improve multidisciplinary communication and care coordination; iv) introduce regional and local protocols for SA diagnosis and treatment; and v) change the structure of healthcare services to reduce specialist waiting times and facilitate access to biologic therapies.","output":"Overcoming Barriers to the Effective Management of Severe Asthma in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: Abdominal wall endometriosis, also known as scar endometriosis, is a rare condition that is becoming increasingly common.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to translate and validate a health information technology readiness instrument, the PRE-HIT instrument, into the Persian language. METHODS: A rigorous process was followed to translate the PRE-HIT instrument into the Persian language. The face and content validity was validated by impact score, content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR). The instrument was used to measure readiness of 289 patients with chronic diseases to engage with digital health with a four point Likert scale. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to check the validity of structure. The convergent and discriminant validity, and internal reliability was expressed by average variance extracted (AVE), construct reliability (CR), maximum shared squared variance (MSV), average shared square variance (ASV), and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Independent samples, t-test and one-way ANOVA were used respectively to compare the impact of sex, education and computer literacy on the performance of all PRE-HIT factors. RESULTS: Eight factors were extracted: health information needs, computer anxiety, computer/internet experience and expertise, preferred mode of interaction, no news is good news, relationship with doctor, cell phone expertise, and internet privacy concerns. They explained 69% of the total variance and the KMO value was 0.79; Bartlett's test of sphericity was also statistically significant (sig < 0.001). The communality of items was higher than 0.5.

Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation. METHODS: In a quest to find a potential drug against this virus, 15 antimalarial drugs (including chloroquine) and 2413 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs were investigated for activity against both the protease and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using an in silico approach. Molecular docking analysis followed by molecular dynamics simulation was performed to estimate the binding and stability of the complexes. RESULTS: This study identified a single drug - paromomycin - with activity against two targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., spike protein (S1) and protease domain. Paromomycin was found to have strong binding affinity for both targets of coronavirus. The results also showed that no antimalarial drug exhibited effective binding for either S1 or protease. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that paromomycin may be an effective dual targeting drug against coronavirus, as it binds not only to the protease domain of the virion, but also to the spike domain, with high stability. Furthermore, none of the antimalarial drugs showed strong binding affinity for either protease or the receptor binding domain (RBD).","output":"Paromomycin: A potential dual targeted drug effectively inhibits both spike (S1) and main protease of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O surto da doen?a respiratria causada pelo novo coronavrus (SARS-CoV-2) aconteceu na cidade de Wuhan, capital da provncia de Hubei, na China, em dezembro de 2019, a qual disseminou-se de forma acelerada e, logo, atingiu mais de uma centena de pases dos cinco continentes Em 12 de mar?o de 2020, a situao foi caracterizada como pandemia pela Organizao Mundial de Sade (OMS, 2020) Em raz?o da disseminao o do Coronavrus pelo mundo, o Ministrio da Sade declarou Emergncia de Sade Pblica de Importancia Nacional (ESPIN) em decorrncia da infeco pelo novo coronavrus (COVID-19) e estabeleceu o Centro de Operaes de Emergncia em Sade Pblica (COE-COVID-19) como mecanismo de gest?o coordenada da resposta  ESPIN no pas (BRASIL, 2020a) Seguindo a linha mundial, o Ministrio da Sade elaborou e publicou &quot;Plano de Contingncia Nacional para Infeco Humana pelo Novo Coronavrus COVID-19&quot;para organizar a deteco, monitoramento e resposta dos servi?os de sade  doen?a (BRASIL, 2020b) O Estado de Gois instituiu o Centro de Operaes Estratgicas de Sade Pblica (COE) em 18 de fevereiro de 2020 (GOIS, 2020a) E, seguindo as orientaes nacionais, prop?e o presente PLANO ESTADUAL DE CONTINGNCIA PARA O ENFRENTAMENTO DA DOEN?A PELO CORONAVRUS (COVID-19), a fim de organizar e fortalecer as polticas pblicas de sade, visto que, para que atinjam eficcia e eficincia,  necessrio atuao conjunta e ordenada dos entes federados, bem como dos setores pblicos e privados The outbreak of respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan city, capital of Hubei province, China, in December 2019, which spread rapidly and thus reached more than a hundred countries on five continents On March 12, 2020, the situation was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) Due to the spread of Coronavirus around the world, the Ministry of Health declared a Public Health Emergency of National Importance (ESPIN) due to infection by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) and established the Center for Emergency Operations in Public Health (COE-COVID-19) as a mechanism for coordinated management of the response to ESPIN in the country (BRASIL, 2020a) Following the global line, the Ministry of Health elaborated and published &quot;National Contingency Plan for Human Infection by the New Coronavirus COVID-19&quot;to organize the detection, monitoring and response of health services to the disease (BRASIL, 2020b) The State of Gois established the Center for Strategic Operations of Public Health (COE) on February 18, 2020 (GOIS, 2020a) And, following the national guidelines, it proposes this State CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR COPING WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), in order to organize and strengthen public health policies, since, in order to achieve effectiveness and efficiency, joint and orderly action of federal entities, as well as public and private sectors, is necessary","output":"Plano estadual de contingncia para o enfrentamento da doen?a pelo Coronavrus (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus in history.

The downstream processing of this class of antibodies is therefore of crucial importance in ensuring that these products can be obtained with high purity and yield. Due to the various fundamental structural similarities between bsAbs and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), many of the current bsAb downstream purification methodologies are based on the established purification processes of mAbs, where affinity, charge, size, hydrophobicity and mixed-mode-based purification are frequently employed. Nevertheless, the downstream processing of bsAbs presents a unique set of challenges due to the presence of bsAb-specific byproducts, such as mispaired products, undesired fragments and higher levels of aggregates, that are otherwise absent or present in lower levels in mAb cell culture supernatants, thus often requiring the design of additional purification strategies in order to obtain products of high purity.

All orthotist initial consultations and all paediatrics spinal theatre activity in Scotland from 1(st) March 2020 to 30(th) June 2020 was analysed and compared to the previous year. RESULTS: There was a 64.3% decline in referrals during the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland to the paediatric spinal service. The mean wait time to be seen in 1(st) clinic for a new referral was 6.56 weeks in 2020 compared to 10.94 in 2019. There were however 60 patients still waiting to be seen.

However, this vaccine induces lower severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S)Cspecific antibody levels than those induced by messenger RNA (mRNA)Cbased vaccines. The immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a homologous or heterologous booster in persons who have received an Ad26.COV2.S priming dose are unclear. METHODS: In this single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving health care workers who had received a priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, we assessed immunogenicity and reactogenicity 28 days after a homologous or heterologous booster vaccination. The participants were assigned to receive no booster, an Ad26.COV2.S booster, an mRNA-1273 booster, or a BNT162b2 booster. The primary end point was the level of S-specific binding antibodies, and the secondary end points were the levels of neutralizing antibodies, S-specific T-cell responses, and reactogenicity. A post hoc analysis was performed to compare mRNA-1273 boosting with BNT162b2 boosting. RESULTS: Homologous or heterologous booster vaccination resulted in higher levels of S-specific binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell responses than a single Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. The increase in binding antibodies was significantly larger with heterologous regimens that included mRNA-based vaccines than with the homologous booster. The mRNA-1273 booster was most immunogenic and was associated with higher reactogenicity than the BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S boosters. Local and systemic reactions were generally mild to moderate in the first 2 days after booster administration. CONCLUSIONS: The Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA boosters had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in health care workers who had received a priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The strongest responses occurred after boosting with mRNA-based vaccines. Boosting with any available vaccine was better than not boosting.

We assessed the impact of the tAccess PSP on adherence to and persistence with vortioxetine among adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in patients with MDD receiving vortioxetine who were enrolled in the tAccess PSP. Eligible patients were 18 to 64 years of age and had 1 vortioxetine claim and 1 inpatient/outpatient medical MDD claim during the 12 months preceding or on the index date, defined as the date of the earliest vortioxetine claim. Study outcomes included medication adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC], adherent 80%) and persistence (the total number of days on therapy without a 30-day gap) at 90, 180, and 365 days. Additionally, persistence was reported for a subset of patients meeting the standardized Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS?) Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM) criteria (the percentage of adults aged 18 to 64 years who remained on an antidepressant for 84 days or 180 days), as defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. These data were reviewed alongside current HEDIS AMM data for commercially insured patients meeting the standardized metric. RESULTS The study identified a total of 2635 patients with an MDD diagnosis and 90 days of follow-up time and a subset of 2238 patients meeting HEDIS AMM criteria. Mean PDC among all patients with MDD was 0.78, with 58.3% of patients achieving PDC 80%. During the 90-day follow-up, 62.1% of patients with MDD were persistent on vortioxetine. Among the subset of patients who met HEDIS AMM criteria, persistence was 83.4% and 69.9% at 84 and 180 days, respectively. In comparison, in 2017, HEDIS AMM criteria for antidepressant persistence were met by 67.8% of commercially insured patients at 84 days and 51.8% at 180 days.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. DESIGN: The Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation model, was used to examine alternative mitigation strategies. The CEACOV model tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. DATA SOURCES: Data from published literature were used to obtain parameters related to COVID-19 and contact-hours. TARGET POPULATION: Undergraduate students and faculty at U.S. colleges. TIME HORIZON: One semester (105 days). PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTION: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including social distancing, masks, and routine laboratory screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections among students and faculty per 5000 students and per 1000 faculty, isolation days, tests, costs, cost per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among students, mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases from 3746 with no mitigation to 493 with extensive social distancing and masks, and further to 151 when laboratory testing was added among asymptomatic persons every 3 days. Among faculty, these values were 164, 28, and 25 cases, respectively. Costs ranged from about $0.4 million for minimal social distancing to about $0.9 million to $2.1 million for strategies involving laboratory testing ($10 per test), depending on testing frequency. Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to test costs. LIMITATION: Data are from multiple sources. CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

This qualitative study describes behavioral health provider perspectives on the use of telebehavioral health before and during the pandemic and how policy changes impacted access to and utilization of behavioral health services in Michigan. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 31 licensed and nonlicensed behavioral health providers operating in Michigan participated in semi-structured interviews between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using inductive methods. Results: The thematic analysis resulted in four overarching themes: (1) increased access to care; (2) maintenance of quality of care; (3) minimal privacy concerns; and (4) client and provider satisfaction. Discussion: During and post-pandemic, providers need flexibility to determine whether in-person or telebehavioral health services, including audio-only, best meet client needs. Providers identified several populations for which telebehavioral health was less accessible: clients with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, those with no broadband Internet access, children, and older adults. Additional training in telebehavioral health service provision can positively impact quality of care. Conclusion: Policies that support reimbursement parity and expand provider use of telebehavioral health services should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic ends to avoid imposing barriers to accessing behavioral health care barriers post-pandemic.","output":"Telebehavioral Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis of Provider Experiences and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is one of the most pressing health problems of this century, but our knowledge of the disease is still limited.

One of the key antiviral effectors is the IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase/ribonuclease L (OAS/RNase L) pathway, which is activated by double-stranded RNA to synthesize unique oligoadenylates, 2-5A, to activate RNase L. RNase L exerts an antiviral effect by cleaving diverse RNA substrates, limiting viral replication; many viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract the OAS/RNase L pathway. Here, we show that the ATP-binding cassette E1 (ABCE1) transporter, identified as an inhibitor of RNase L, regulates RNase L activity and RNase L-induced autophagy during viral infections. ABCE1 knockdown cells show increased RNase L activity when activated by 2-5A. Compared to parental cells, the autophagy-inducing activity of RNase L in ABCE1-depleted cells is enhanced with early onset. RNase L activation in ABCE1-depleted cells inhibits cellular proliferation and sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Increased activity of caspase-3 causes premature cleavage of autophagy protein, Beclin-1, promoting a switch from autophagy to apoptosis. ABCE1 regulates autophagy during EMCV infection, and enhanced autophagy in ABCE1 knockdown cells promotes EMCV replication.

Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA1c levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: We included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2, 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1c was 7.5%, and 33.1% died.

This is presumed due to low immunity associated with other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome. But the information available on the immune status of COVID-19 patients is limited. Attempts must be made to enhance our understanding of the immune status of COVID-19 patients by revisiting our knowledge on the immune mechanisms of already known coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Early elevation of the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in SARS and MERS infection suggests a possible same type of cytokine storm-mediated lung damage in COVID-19 patients too. Dysregulation of interferon-1 response and downstream cascade in initial innate immune response at virus entry point has been related to lethal pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Adaptive response of increased CD8+ levels in COVID-19 patients seems to be useful in mild cases where it causes deteriorating effects in progressed severe disease patients resulting in destruction of type 2 pneumocytes hence inability to regenerate the alveolar epithelium. A phenomenon called cytokine storm activates violent immunological reactions in the lung tissue resulting in ARDS followed by multiple organ system damages in COVID-19 patients. Several immune evading mechanisms are thought to be employed by severe respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that might have resulted in its extremely increased contagiousness probably related with its frequent RNA mutations. Failure to develop adequate virus limiting immune reactions by some cured patients warrant monitoring of all recovered patients.

We hypothesize that preconditioning with sevoflurane is a protective factor against ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS In this randomized controlled trial, patients ASA I-II undergoing breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps were allocated into two groups and analyzed: group BAL included patients who received balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane for 30 min before removal of the flap and throughout the surgery. The TCI group included patients who received a total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. We evaluated regional tissue oximetry at the end of the surgery and at 4, 12 and 20 h after surgery. Other assessed parameters were: blood lactate clearance, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase. RESULTS In total 54 patients, twenty-seven per group, were analyzed. There was a significant increase of the average value of regional tissue oximetry measured 4 h after surgery in the BAL group compared to the TCI group: BAL: 84.05 % (8.96 SD); TCI : 76.17 % (12.92 SD) (P = 0.03), but not at the other time frames. The creatine phosphokinase value was significantly lower in the BAL group at the end of surgery, but not at the other time-frames. There were no significant differences in blood levels of other markers.

The lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflows to Wuhan by 76.98%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.31%, and within-Wuhan movements by 55.91%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities C the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak C on the destination cities' new infection cases. We also provide evidence that the enhanced social distancing policies in the 98 Chinese cities outside Hubei province were effective in reducing the impact of the population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV in the destination cities. We find that in the counterfactual world in which Wuhan were not locked down on January 23, 2020, the COVID-19 cases would be 105.27% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province.

We evaluated patients' adherence to GRMT following AMI and the association with long-term (up-to 10 years) mortality, healthcare resource utilization and costs. METHODS: AMI patients hospitalized in a tertiary medical center in Israel that survived at least a year following post-discharge and enrolled in the two largest health plans were analyzed. Data were obtained from computerized medical records. Patients were defined as adherent when &#8805;80 % of the GRMT prescriptions were issue during the first post-discharge year. Hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, primary care utilization and outpatient consulting clinic and other ambulatory services expenditure were calculated annually. RESULTS: Overall 8287 patients qualified for the study (mean age 65.0  13.6 years, 69.7 % males). Adherent patients (n = 1767, 21.3 %) were more likely to be younger, women and increased prevalence of most traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress. The translation of some mRNAs occurs in specialized translation factories, assemblysomes, transperons and other structures necessary for the correct folding of proteins, interaction with functional partners and formation of oligomeric complexes. Intracellular localization of mRNA has a significant impact on the efficiency of its translation and presumably determines its response to cellular stress. Compartmentalization of mRNAs and the translation machinery also plays an important role in viral infections. Many viruses provoke the formation of specific intracellular structures, virus factories, for the production of their proteins. Here we review the current concepts of the molecular mechanisms of transport, selective localization and local translation of cellular and viral mRNAs, their effects on protein targeting and topogenesis, and on the regulation of protein biosynthesis in different compartments of the eukaryotic cell. Special attention is paid to new systems biology approaches, providing new cues to the study of localized translation.","output":"mRNA Targeting, Transport and Local Translation in Eukaryotic Cells: From the Classical View to a Diversity of New Concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women in low- and middle-income countries have high rates of perinatal depression.

METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire with personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders informations was answered by 2,140 female and male Brazilians who were recruited through online advertising. RESULTS: Thirty percent of the participants presented symptoms of moderate/severe depression and 23.3% displayed moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. A greater presence of symptoms related to anxiety and depression were associated with low physical activity levels, low family monthly income, and younger age. A higher percentage of men who had no mood disorders was observed among those who were very active than among those less active. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on physical activity. Those who reduced their level of physical activity had the highest levels of mood disorders. Therefore, considering all the non-communicable diseases and mental diseases associated with physical inactivity , humans are likely to be much more vulnerable during this period of social distancing, including that of combating a possible COVID-19 disease.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to utilize a large, nationally representative dataset of critically ill adults with COVID-19 to determine which factors explain mortality variability. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, we examined adults hospitalized in intensive care units with COVID-19 at 70 United States hospitals between March and June 2020. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined patient-level and hospital-level variables. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with interhospital variation. The median odds ratio (OR) was calculated to compare outcomes in higher- vs. lower-mortality hospitals. A gradient boosted machine algorithm was developed for individual-level mortality models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4,019 patients were included, 1537 (38%) of whom died by 28 days. Mortality varied considerably across hospitals (0-82%). After adjustment for patient- and hospital-level domains, interhospital variation was attenuated (OR decline from 2.06 [95% CI, 1.73-2.37] to 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00-1.38]), with the greatest changes occurring with adjustment for acute physiology, socioeconomic status, and strain. For individual patients, the relative contribution of each domain to mortality risk was: acute physiology (49%), demographics and comorbidities (20%), socioeconomic status (12%), strain (9%), hospital quality (8%), and treatments (3%). CONCLUSION: There is considerable interhospital variation in mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19, which is mostly explained by hospital-level socioeconomic status, strain, and acute physiologic differences. Individual mortality is driven mostly by patient-level factors.

It is unclear, however, if COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with or without veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (VV-ECMO) have more intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) compared to other ARDS patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational single-center study enrolling all patients with ARDS from 01/2018 to 05/2020. PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with ARDS were allocated to the COVID-19 group. Propensity score matching was performed for age, VV-ECMO, and bleeding risk. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients with moderate or severe ARDS were identified, 47 (28.8%) in the COVID-19 group, and 116 (71.2%) in the non-COVID-19 group. In 63/163 cases (38.7%), VV-ECMO therapy was required. The ICU survival was 52.8%. COVID-19 patients were older, more often male, and exhibited a lower SOFA score, but the groups showed similar rates of VV-ECMO therapy. Treatments with antiplatelet agents (p = 0.043) and therapeutic anticoagulation (p = 0.028) were significantly more frequent in the COVID-19 patients. ICH was detected in 22 patients (13.5%) with no statistical difference between the groups (11.2 vs. 19.1% with and without SARS-CoV-2, respectively, p = 0.21).

Mainly to identify target sequences in order to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, but also to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution and to mine for variants associated with reduced or increased disease severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses have been released, but the main interest lies in the Spike protein, which is the pivotal element of current vaccine design, and in the Receptor Binding Domain, that accounts for most of the neutralizing the antibody activity. METHODS: Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol, and a web portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Furthermore, we provide immunogenomic analyses to understand the impact of the most frequent RBD variations. RESULTS: Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (October 2020) reveals an emerging mutation, S477N, located on the central part of the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain, the Receptor Binding Motif. Immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility, T-cell recognition, and B-cell epitope probability for most frequent human HLAs.

In Canada, adults 65 and older experience anxiety at a rate of 6.4%, affecting more than 300,000 people. Anxiety in older adults has been linked to difficulties retaining new information and engaging in instrumental daily activities of living. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, novel methods of delivering therapy programs remotely are needed, however data is limited. There is some evidence that older adults prefer non-pharmacological approaches for anxiety that can be delivered in the community. Emotion-Focused Mindfulness Therapy (EFMT) is a mindfulness-based intervention that emphasizes meditation and observing thoughts and emotions as they arise. This emphasis has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of anxiety in general populations. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of EFMT with older adults. Methods: : This pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial will use a wait list control trial design. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we will use telehealth delivery via Zoom rather than in-person delivery. The first 48 people to meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to either receive EFMT immediately, or in approximately eight weeks time from enrollment (1:1 allocation ratio). Data will be collected at baseline, eight weeks following baseline, and sixteen weeks following baseline. The primary outcomes will determine the feasibility of the intervention based on recruitment, enrolment, retention and adherence to all components of the intervention. The secondary outcome will be changes to anxiety over time. Discussion: The results of this trial will determine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of video-delivered EFMT for late-life anxiety compared to no treatment.

The enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at < 3000 J/L of UV-C, being the dose needed to inactivate 4 log TCID(50) (4D) of 1612 J/L for PRV,1004 J/L for PRRSV, 1953 J/L for PEDV, 1639 J/L for SIV, 1641 J/L for CSFV and 1943 J/L for BVDV. The non-enveloped viruses tended to have higher 4D values: 2161 J/L for PPV, 3223 J/L for SVA and 3708 J/L for SVDV. Because the initial viral concentration was <4.0 Log for PCV-2, it was not possible to calculate the 4D value for this virus. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system is capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses inoculated in commercially collected porcine or bovine plasma.

PEDV outbreaks have occurred continuously in most swine-producing Asian countries and have recently emerged in the United States, leading to large economic losses for both the Asian and US pig industries. The spike (S) protein of PEDV consists of the S1 and S2 domains, responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. The involvement of the S1 domain in specific high-affinity interactions with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host makes it a logical target for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against PEDV. Passive immunization by oral administration of egg yolk antibodies (IgY) obtained from immunized chickens provides an alternative source of specific antibodies for the prevention and treatment of PEDV in newborn piglets. In this study, we produced an IgY against the PEDV S1 protein and investigated its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal piglets. A codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene consisting of amino acid residues 25C749 was synthesized and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing a recombinant PEDV S1 protein containing the chicken immunoglobulin Fc fragment at its C-terminus. The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate potent immune responses in immunized hens. We next tested the ability of oral passive immunization with anti-PEDV S1 IgY to protect piglets against PEDV. Specific chicken IgY against the S1 protein was orally administered to neonatal piglets, and their responses subsequent to a virulent PEDV challenge were monitored. The results showed that oral administration of anti-PEDV S1 IgY efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, suggesting its potential as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against acute PEDV infection.","output":"Immunoprophylactic effect of chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY) against a recombinant S1 domain of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein in piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents an approach to modeling epidemic processes based on machine learning.

International guidelines recommend vaccination to limit this risk of infection, although live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated once immunosuppressive therapy has begun. Biologic therapies used to treat IMIDs target the immune system to stop chronic pathogenic process but may also attenuate the protective immune response to vaccines. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding vaccine responses in IMID patients receiving treatment with biologic therapies, with a focus on the interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitors. B cell-depleting therapies, such as rituximab, strongly impair vaccines immunogenicity, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) fusion protein abatacept are also associated with attenuated antibody responses, which are further diminished in patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants. On the other hand, integrin, IL-6, IL-12/23, IL-17, and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) inhibitors do not appear to affect the immune response to several vaccines evaluated. Importantly, treatment with biologic therapies in IMID patients is not associated with an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or developing severe disease. However, the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on IMID patients may be reduced compared with healthy individuals. The impact of biologic therapies on the response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seems to replicate what has been described for other vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination appears to be safe and well tolerated in IMID patients. Attenuated but, in general, still protective responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the context of certain therapies warrant current recommendations for a third primary dose in IMID patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs.","output":"Response to Vaccines in Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This thinking piece examines, from the viewpoint of two Canadian pracademics in the pandemic, the role of pedagogy and professionalism in crisis teaching and learning.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers the current context of COVID-19 and education and uses the professional capital framework (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012) to examine pandemic pedagogies and professionalism. Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted educational systems into emergency remote teaching and learning. This rapid shift to crisis schooling has massive implications for pedagogy and professionalism during the pandemic and beyond. Despite the significant challenges for educators, policymakers, school leaders, students and families, the pandemic is a critical opportunity to rethink the future of schooling. A key to transformational change will be for schools and school systems to focus on their professional capital and find ways to develop teachers' individual knowledge and skills, support effective collaborative networks that include parents and the larger school community and, ultimately, trust and include educators in the decision-making and communication process.

This allows them to report the associated sensory effects and to identify those molecules which are altered or parosmic in nature. RESULTS: Here we show 15 different molecular triggers of this symptom. These trigger molecules are common to many in the parosmic volunteer group and share certain characteristics such as extremely low olfactory threshold and common molecular structure CONCLUSIONS: We posit that specific highly odour-active molecules are the cause of the parosmic symptom in most cases and initiate the sense of disgust, suggesting that parosmia is, at least in part, a receptor-level phenomenon.","output":"Insights into the molecular triggers of parosmia based on gas chromatography olfactometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The book engages with hope in the setting of phase I cancer trials, stem cell interventions, right-to-try laws and crowd funding, offering a new language to explain our discomfort with some of these quests.

However, so far, there are no reports confirming this theory. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among children might be higher because (i) school-aged children have higher contact rates and (ii) the current COVID-19 vaccination strategy prioritizes the elderly in most countries. This study assesses the age-varying susceptibility to the Delta and pre-Delta strains.Methods: Combining age-specific contact matrices and observed periods between each stage of infection, we constructed a compartmental model (SEIQ) of the COVID-19 transmission. The strength of this model is that we know the transition time distribution to the next infection stage (E  I [Latent period], I given the Symptom onset, Symptom onset  Q [Diagnostic delay]), based on the robust contact tracing study in South Korea. We used a Bayesian inference method to estimate the force of infection (S  E), the remaining variable in this model. We compared the age-specific susceptibility to the Delta with those to the original virus, using the 3rd (pre-Delta) and 4th (driven by the Delta variant) waves in South Korea. As vaccine uptake increased, we excluded those who were immunized from the susceptible population in accordance with the vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant.Findings: A significant difference between the age-specific susceptibility to the Delta and that to the pre-Delta variant was found in the younger age group. The fold rise in susceptibility to the Delta/pre-Delta variant was highest in the 10C15 years age group (192-fold rise), whereas in those aged 50 years or more, the susceptibility to the Delta/pre-Delta remained stable at approximately one-fold.Interpretation: Even after adjusting for both contact pattern and vaccination status, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 tends to propagate more easily among children than the pre-Delta strains.Funding Information: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1A2C3A01003550) and (No. 2021R1F1A1064473).

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on patients with various psychiatric disorders who were admitted to inpatient treatment. METHODS: : Five-hundred thirty-eight inpatients with mental disorders participated in a survey about psychological consequences of the pandemic between March-December 2020. We examined the perceived burden by restrictions and worries, changes in health care utilization, and helpfulness of coping strategies. RESULTS: : More than 50% reported any worsening of symptoms, 40% stated increased need of therapeutic support. High rates of symptom deterioration were observed for depressive symptoms (>55%), anxiety (>40%), and sleeping behavior (>40%). Treatment impairment was stated by 27.9%. Patients with anxiety disorders were less affected by contact restrictions compared with eating disorders and depression. Patients with anorexia nervosa and post-traumatic stress disorder experienced higher helpfulness by daily structuring than patients with depression. DISCUSSION: : About half of our sample of psychiatric patients experienced symptom deterioration due to the pandemic and about one quarter reported impairment of treatment modalities.

The producers of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the public's willingness to comply with public health measures.

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between area-level indicators of income and total mortality during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic in the most hit Italian region. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on the number of deaths registered in the municipalities of the Lombardy region (Italy) between January 2019 and June 2020. Municipalities were grouped according to quintiles of average income and pension of their resident population. Monthly age-standardized mortality ratios (MRs) between the poorest and the richest municipalities and the corresponding 95% CI were computed to evaluate whether the pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities widened during the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the study period, 175 853 deaths were registered. During the pre-pandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020) the MR between the poorest and the richest municipalities ranged between 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.25) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20-1.47). In March 2020, when the pandemic began to rapidly spread in the region, it raised up to 1.61 (95% CI: 1.51-1.72) and decreased thereafter, reaching the pre-pandemic values in April 2020. Similar results were observed in the analysis of the mortality at ages 65 and over in municipalities grouped according to average pension, where the MR increased up to 1.82 (95% CI: 1.70-1.94) in March 2020.

Even with the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the extraordinary effort to distribute the vaccines must be paired with continued adherence to behavioral recommendations as well as vaccine confidence. To facilitate rapid and equitable uptake of the vaccines, there is a need for responsive, trustworthy, and evidence-informed communication about vaccination, enhanced trust in science, and engaging populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine confidence will address the emerging gaps between vaccine availability and actual vaccination. Although these gaps are attributable, in part, to challenges with logistics and access, social and behavioral drivers of vaccination decision making also have a significant role in vaccination uptake. As federal, state, and local health and public health agencies coordinate vaccine dissemination, there will be a continuous need to adapt to an evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, new scientific information, and the spread of COVID-19- and vaccine-related misinformation. Facilitating widespread vaccination and maintaining a focus on equity requires thoughtful and compassionate approaches to reach and address the needs of those who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic such as underserved, vulnerable, and racial/ethnic minority populations.

PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 60-year-old male presented cough without any breathing difficulty. Vital signs showed blood pressure 130/75 mmHg, pulse 84x/minute, respiratory rate (RR) 21x/minute, body temperature 36.5C, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 75% on room air. RT-PCR for COVID-19 were positive. On third day, he complained of worsening of breath shortness, but his RR was still normal (22x/minute) with SpO2 of 98% on 3 L/minute oxygen via nasal cannula. On fifth day, he experienced severe shortness of breath with RR 38x/minute. He was then intubated using a synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.54, PaO2 58.9 mmHg, PaCO2 31.1 mmHg, HCO3 26.9mEq/L, SaO2 94.7%, FiO2 30%, and P/F ratio 196 mmHg. On eighth day, his condition deteriorated with blood pressure 80/40 mmHg with norepinephrine support, pulse 109x/minute, and SpO2 72% with ventilator. He experienced cardiac arrest and underwent basic life support, then resumed strained breathing with return of spontaneous circulation. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.07, PaO2 58.1 mmHg, PaCO2 108.9 mmHg, HCO3 32.1mEq/L, SaO2 78.7%, FiO2 90%, and P/F ratio 65 mmHg. Three hours later, he suffered cardiac arrest again and eventually died. DISCUSSION: Possible mechanisms of silent hypoxemia are V/Q mismatch, intrapulmonary shunting, and intravascular microthrombi.

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group and period of the outbreak. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time-series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015-May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the period 15 February-15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47 490 [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCIs): 43 984 to 50 362] deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95% eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced increases up to 800% during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. CONCLUSION: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.

METHODS In our GRACE colorectal surgery database comprising 508 patients, we analysed patients scheduled for right colectomy (n = 160). Adherence to the protocol, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay of IBD patients (n = 45) were compared with those of non-IBD patients (n = 115). Data (mean  SD, median [IQR], count (%)) were compared by Student's t, Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests when appropriate; p < 0.05 taken as statistically significant. RESULTS IBD patients were significantly younger (38.9  13.8 vs. 58.9  18.5 years, p < 0.001) and had lower BMI (23.0  5.0 vs. 25.1  5.0 kg m-2, p < 0.01).

ARDS is caused by increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to lung damage and loss of lung function. There are currently no effective therapies for combatting ARDS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a potential treatment for ARDS due to their significant immunomodulatory properties. MSC small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), including exosomes, modulate the immune response as effectively as MSCs themselves, with the added advantages of increased safety and tissue penetration. METHODS: We isolated sEVs from MSCs induced to secrete increased levels of neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors, termed Exo MSC-NTF, and compared their ability to treat ARDS, in a lung injury LPS mouse model, to sEVs isolated from na?ve MSCs (Exo MSC). Measurments of lung histopathological changes and neutrophil infiltration, blood oxygen saturation, and bronchoalveolar lavge fluid (BALF) proinflammatory cytokines and coagulation related factors were performed. RESULTS: We found that Exo MSC-NTF was superior to Exo MSC in reducing LPS-induced ARDS markers, including physiological lung damage such as alveolar wall thickness, fibrin presence, and neutrophil accumulation, as well as increasing oxygenation levels. Furthermore, Exo MSC-NTF reversed the imbalance in the host immune response, seen as decreased IFN-, IL-6, TNF-, and RANTES levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Results: 24 studies were included in this review. Studies were conducted in the USA, China, Spain, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Brazil. Most patients were intubated in the intensive care unit. Rapid sequence induction was mostly used for intubation. ROX index might be utilized for the predictor of the necessity of intubation in COVID-19 patients. According to the previous studies the rate of intubation reported 5 to 88%. It was revealed that 1.4 - 44.5% of patients might be extubated. Yet obesity and age (elderly) are the only risk factors of delayed or difficult extubation. Discussion and conclusion: Acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients could require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, and hypoxia were the most important reasons for intubation. Also, increased levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and lipase in common with hypoxia are correlated with intubation and ICU admission Mortality following intubation is reported to be 15 to 36%.

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which - in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 - both as monotherapies and in combination. In this context, we take advantage of several safety and efficacy studies in patients with the chronic myeloproliferative blood cancers (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis) (MPNs), in whom IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib have been used successfully for the last 10 (ruxolitinib) to 30 years (IFN) as monotherapies and most recently in combination as well.

Participants were asked at follow-up if they downloaded the app. RESULTS: A total of 902 (90.6%) of 996 baseline participants responded to the follow-up survey. Among them, 184 (20.4%) reported that they downloaded the app. Downloading of the contact tracing app was significantly negatively associated with psychological distress at follow-up after controlling for baseline variables, but not with worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that using a government-issued COVID-19 contact tracing app may be beneficial for the mental health of employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Effects of Downloading a Government-Issued COVID-19 Contact Tracing App on Psychological Distress During the Pandemic Among Employed Adults: Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to present a new distributed interactive career decision-making framework (diCDM) in which person and context together determine the development of a sustainable career. We build upon recent theories from two disciplines: decision theory and career theory. Our new conceptual framework incorporates distributed stakeholders into the career decision-making process and suggests that individuals make decisions through a system of distributed agency, in which they interact with their context to make each career decision, at varying levels of participation, from proactive to reactive. We focus on two key career decision-making drivers originating from the person (exercising personal agency and seeking meaning), and two key drivers from the career context (making demands on an individuals resources and affording scripts). This manuscript challenges the individual-driven approach to career development, and instead proposes that a process of distributed career decision-making takes place between each person and the various stakeholders, both individual and institutional, that also drive their career. Career seekers and counselors can use this framework to supplement an individual-focused approach and incorporate the role of distributed decision-makers in sustaining an individuals career. Empirical research is needed to explore and test the applicability of the framework to career decisions in practice.","output":"A Distributed Interactive Decision-Making Framework for Sustainable Career Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis underwent whole lung lavage of the right lung.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the readiness on the part of teachers to switch/adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy. Also, this study analyses relationship between perceived stress (PS) and readiness to change (RTC)/adopt. Design/methodology/approach All the constructs were adapted from established scales, exploratory factor analysis confirmed item loadings on the appropriate constructs. Convenience sampling was used for data collection;owing to COVID-19 this appeared to be the only viable method. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for analysis of data. Findings Results from this study indicate that 32.2% variance in RTC is accounted for by exogenous constructs perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and autonomy (AUT). Although f2 effect size pointed towards non-significance of AUT in predicting RTC (path coefficients were found to be significant for all the exogenous constructs). Also, RTC accounted for 32.6% variance in PS. To assess the predictive relevance of the model, blindfolding procedure was used to obtain Q2 values (Q2PS = 0.231;Q2RTC = 0.243). Positive Q2 values provide support for the model's predictive relevance. Research limitations/implications Data were collected from teachers employed in urban public schools. A complete picture can be obtained by involving teachers from rural public and state-run schools. Practical implications Teachers' readiness to adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy may act as a starting point for the policymakers to design properly structured training programs for teachers that minimise stress levels. Social implications If not handled properly, the society may end with either loss of learning to one generation or a major chunk of stressed-out teaching populations or both.

With the fruitful advancements and purposes, the authenticity and security breaches in digital images are simultaneously increasing because many editing software and tools give easy access to manipulate and temper the images, resulting in the change of complete information. Copy Move Forgery is the simplest way of tempering images in which an object is copied, removed, and replaced in the same image. As the medical field is too sensitive and even a minor manipulation can produce disastrous results, this study proposes an algorithm specifically designed to detect copy move forgery in medical images, especially when the world has gone towards telemedicine due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The proposed algorithm is based on CNN working on the whole image. The algorithm works in three phases, i.e., pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed algorithm has given the accuracy of 89 percent on the dataset that has been created due to the publicly non-availability of forged medical images dataset.

However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses. Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals, often spanning three or more viral generations (&#8805;2 weeks of transmission) before an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers, establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will, investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns, so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.","output":"Long, thin transmission chains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 may go undetected for several weeks at low to moderate reproduction numbers: Implications for containment and elimination strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cardiac effects of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) include myocarditis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and cardioembolic events in the general population.

Extensive physicochemical characterization of the -Sc0.1Fe1.9O3 sample was performed employing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), magnetization measurements, 57Fe M?ssbauer spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Magnetization vs. temperature plots showed vanishing of the two-step magnetic transition for the Sc-doped -Fe2O3 sample; a decrease in the magnetization profile was observed only once upon the change in the temperature. The Sc3+ substitution was found to cause a constriction of the magnetic transition region and a shift of the onset of the magnetic transition to a higher temperature in comparison with the undoped -Fe2O3 system. Moreover, upon the introduction of Sc3+ ions in the -Fe2O3 crystal lattice, a magnetic hardness was altered accompanied by a decrease in the coercivity. With 57Fe M?ssbauer spectroscopy, it was identified that Sc3+ predominantly substitutes Fe3+ in the distorted octahedral A- and B-sites and with almost equivalent occupation probability at both positions. Moreover, the electrochemical measurements confirmed the increase in the resistivity in the Sc-doped -Fe2O3 systems. Thus, the results, achieved within the present study, demonstrated an effect of Sc3+ substitution on the preparation purity of -Fe2O3 systems without the presence of any other iron(III) oxide admixtures and on the change in its magnetic and electrochemical features, proving their feasible tuning with respect to the requirements of potential future applications.","output":"An effect of scandium substitution on the phase purity and structural, magnetic, and electrochemical features of -Fe2O3 nanoparticle systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affected specific occupations and industries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protects the health and safety of workers by setting and enforcing standards for working conditions. Workers may file OSHA complaints about unsafe conditions. Complaints may indicate poor workplace safety during the pandemic. We evaluated COVID-19-related complaints filed with California (Cal)/OSHA between January 1, 2020 and December 14, 2020 across seven industries. To assess whether workers in occupations with high COVID-19-related mortality were also most likely to file Cal/OSHA complaints, we compared industry-specific per-capita COVID-19 confirmed deaths from the California Department of Public Health with COVID-19-related complaints. Although 7,820 COVID-19-related complaints were deemed valid by Cal/OSHA, only 627 onsite inspections occurred and 32 citations were issued. Agricultural workers had the highest per-capita COVID-19 death rates (402 per 100,000 workers) but were least represented among workplace complaints (44 per 100,000 workers). Health Care workers had the highest complaint rates (81 per 100,000 workers) but the second lowest COVID-19 death rate (81 per 100,000 workers). Industries with the highest inspection rates also had high COVID-19 mortality. Our findings suggest complaints are not proportional to COVID-19 risk. Instead, higher complaint rates may reflect worker groups with greater empowerment, resources, or capacity to advocate for better protections. This capacity to advocate for safe workplaces may account for relatively low mortality rates in potentially high-risk occupations.

An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately.

AIM: To explore the experiences of primary care workers with different methods of screening for AF and with implementation in daily practice. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with GPs, nurses and assistants, experienced with implementation of different methods of screening. METHOD: Two independent researchers audio recorded and analysed interviews using a thematic approach. They asked participants about their experiences with the different methods used for screening AF and which obstacles they faced with implementing screening in daily practice. RESULTS: In total 15 GPs, nurse practitioners and assistants from 7 different practices were interviewed. The GP's office is suited for screening for AF, which ideally should be integrated with standard care. Participants considered pulse palpation, automated sphygmomanometer with AF detection and single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) as practical tests. Participants trusted pulse palpation over the algorithm of the devices. The follow-up of a positive test with a time-consuming 12-lead ECG hindered integration of screening. The single-lead ECG device reduces the need for immediate follow-up, because it can record a rhythm strip. The extra workload of screening and lack of financial coverage form obstacles for implementation.

Clinical data indicate that the number of patients with oligometastatic disease receiving aggressive treatment is increasing rapidly. We examine the key evidence supporting or refuting the existence of an oligometastatic state. Numerous single-arm studies suggest that long-term survival is 'better-than-expected' after ablative treatment. However, the few studies with adequate controls raise the possibility that this long-term survival might not be due to the treatments themselves, but rather to the selection of patients based on favourable inclusion criteria. Furthermore, ablative treatments carry a risk of harming healthy tissue, yet the risk-benefit ratio cannot be quantified if the benefits are unmeasured. If the strategy of treating oligometastases is to gain widespread acceptance as routine clinical practice, there should be stronger evidence supporting its efficacy.","output":"The oligometastatic state - separating truth from wishful thinking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major public health problem worldwide since its outbreak in 2019.

This necessitates early detection and elective treatment. The goal of this study was to develop an easy-to-train algorithm which is capable of automated AAA screening in CT scans and can be applied to an intra-hospital environment. Three deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet, VGG-16 and AlexNet) were adapted for 3D classification and applied to a dataset consisting of 187 heterogenous CT scans. The 3D ResNet outperformed both other networks. Across the five folds of the first training dataset it achieved an accuracy of 0.856 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.926. Subsequently, the algorithms performance was verified on a second data set containing 106 scans, where it ran fully automated and resulted in an accuracy of 0.953 and an AUC of 0.971. A layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) made the decision process interpretable and showed that the network correctly focused on the aortic lumen. In conclusion, the deep learning-based screening proved to be robust and showed high performance even on a heterogeneous multi-center data set.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study has been conducted in SLE patients (supplemented and not supplemented patients), matched to healthy controls by age and gender. The 25[OH]D serum level was measured by chemiluminescence assay and CYP27B1-1260 genetic polymorphism was carried out using PCR-RFLP methods. Statistical analysis was made using Shesis and SPSS.20 Software. RESULTS: Controls and Vit D not supplemented patients' groups presented the highest percentage of hypovitaminosis D. A significant difference in the mean level of circulating 25[OH]D between Vit D supplemented SLE patients and controls was observed (23.91 ng/ml and 7.18 ng/ml, respectively p = 3.4 105 ). Our results showed a correlation of high 25[OH]D level with complement component 3 levels and prednisolone drug. Moreover, the analysis of CYP27B1-1260 polymorphism in SLE patients and controls revealed a nonsignificant allelic or genotypic association. CONCLUSION: Despite the sunny climate, the high prevalence of Vit D deficiency is common in Tunisia.

In this work, autohydrolysis-like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five-membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six-membered structures.

Children who are commenced on ADHD medication require regular assessments to ensure safety and continuation of medication and to check progress of their condition. Objectives We would like to ascertain whether: . baseline cardiovascular assessment and measurements (height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate) have been carried out on children and young people prior to starting ADHD medication . the initial assessment and subsequent follow ups met the criteria outlined within NICE guidance (2019) . there are any safeguarding concerns and if present, escalated appropriately Methods The sample of children and young people was obtained randomly via SystmOne (electronic record) using the read code 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder' to identify them between January to December 2019. They were all started on one of the following medications: Medikinet, Medikinet XL, Matoride XL, Concerta XL, Equasym XL and Elvanse. They were assessed and reviewed by an array of different clinicians. The audit was reviewed against NICE guidance: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Diagnosis and Management (2019). Results 20 children and young people were included in the audit. All (100%) had a baseline height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate (H, W, BP and HR) taken and recorded at their initial assessment. 95% of the children had the baseline readings of their H, W, BP and HR documented on their clinic letter, and 75% had their BP and HR percentiles recorded. As per NICE guidance, children on ADHD medication require a repeat blood BP and HR after each dose change and every six months. 25% of the children in this audit had a repeat BP and HR within six months, associated with a medication change or dose adjustment. Similarly, NICE advises that children should have a follow up height every 6 months and a follow up weight every 3 months for children under the age of years and every 6 months for children over the age of 10 years. 20% of children in this audit had a repeat height and weight within these specified timeframes, and this was also associated with a medication change or dose adjustment. NICE guidance states that all children should have a cardiovascular assessment prior to starting ADHD medication;this audit found that 85% of children had documentation pertaining to 'normal heart sounds/heart murmur', and the ADHD pre-drug checklist was completed in 80% of cases. Safeguarding was also included in this audit, however only 15% had current or recent safeguarding needs and none of these required any further escalation. Conclusions Undoubtedly some of the results of this audit may have been impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, which commenced in March 2019 and naturally had a significant impact on service delivery and provision during the months that followed. With regards to this audit, this is likely to be particularly relevant to the children's blood pressure and heart rate measurements and follow up appointments.

Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0-1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2-6, median = 13 days, with 30.0-78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7-9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities). Severe patients were stratified into three risk categories for disease progression: low risk (Score 0-5, with less than 12.7% probabilities), intermediate risk (Score 6-11, with 18.6-69.1% probabilities), and high risk (Score 12-16, with more than 77.9% probabilities) by TRPNCLP score. The two risk scores performed well with good discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Two easy-to-use risk stratification score systems were built to predict the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with different clinical types.

Behavioral symptoms with cognitive impairment may mimic the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and other early-onset dementias. Our patients were analyzed and the literature was reviewed to delineate neurological and neuroimaging findings suggestive of NHD. METHOD: Fourteen patients carrying a pathogenic mutation in the TREM2 gene were found in our database. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: The presenting clinical picture was behavioral changes with cognitive decline resembling bvFTD in all patients. The mean age was 37.1  4.97 years and the mean duration of the disease was 8.9  3.51 years. Only two patients had typical bone cysts. Seven patients had bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia in computed tomography of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed severe atrophy of the corpus callosum, enlargement of the ventricles, atrophy of the caudate nuclei and periventricular white matter changes in all patients. Symmetrical global atrophy of the brain mainly affecting frontoparietal and lateral temporal regions were observed in all cases, and 13 patients had atrophy of the hippocampus.

In the present study, we change the approach to ask which technique is best for the individual patient\`s risk profile. For this, two criteria are important: does the patient need reconstruction of the abdominal wall? or does he or she need treatment of symptoms without being exposed to unnecessarily high perioperative risks? METHODS In a heuristic selection procedure, 486 consecutive patients were classified according to their characteristics as low-risk or high-risk for postoperative complications. Low-risk patients preferentially underwent open abdominal wall reconstruction with mesh (MFR + mesh), high-risk patients mainly a bridging-mesh procedure, either by laparoscopic (Lap.-IPOM) or open approach (Open-IPOM). Primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcome was the recurrence-free interval. The propensity score was used for covariate adjustment analyzing recurrence rate as well as postoperative complications using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS Comparison of all surgical procedures showed risk factors had no independent influence on occurrence of complications (p = 0.110). Hernial gap width was an independent factor for occurrence of complications (p = 0.002).

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more prone to a severe course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to comorbidities and an altered immune system. The studys aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (> 85 years compared to 15C65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27C33.20, p = 0.025). We further identified markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (> 2  upper limit of normal, aOR 23.21, 95% CI 3.66C147.11, p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (< 120,000/l, aOR 11.66, 95% CI 2.49C54.70, p = 0.002), anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl, aOR 3.21, 95% CI 1.17C8.82, p = 0.024), and C-reactive protein ( 30 mg/l, aOR 3.44, 95% CI 1.13C10.45, p = 0.029) as predictors, while renal replacement therapy was not related to mortality (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.68C1.93, p = 0.611). CONCLUSION: The identified predictors include routinely measured and universally available parameters. Their assessment might facilitate risk stratification in this highly vulnerable cohort as early as at initial medical evaluation for SARS-CoV-2.

We set out to understand countries perceptions of these recommendations, through frank and anonymous dialogue. In 2019 and 2020, we performed in-depth interviews with national policymakers and antibiotic resistance experts in 13 countries (ten European countries and three non-European) for a total of 73 individuals in 27 separate interviews. Interviewees expressed high-level support for antibiotic incentives in 11 of 13 countries. There is recognition that new economic incentives are needed to maintain a reliable supply to essential antibiotics. However, most countries are uncertain which incentives may be appropriate for their country, which antibiotics should be included, how to implement incentives, and how much it will cost. There is a preference for a multinational incentive, so long as it is independent of national pricing, procurement, and reimbursement processes. Nine countries indicated a preference for a model that ensures access to both existing and new antibiotics, with the highest priority for existing antibiotics. Twelve of thirteen countries indicated that shortages of existing antibiotics is a serious problem. Since countries are skeptical about the public health value of many recently approved antibiotics, there is a mismatch regarding revenue expectations between policymakers and antibiotic innovators. This paper presents important considerations for the design and implementation of antibiotic pull mechanisms. We also propose a multinational model that appears to match the needs of both countries and innovators.","output":"National Facilitators and Barriers to the Implementation of Incentives for Antibiotic Access and Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a non-invasive device, for assessing two vital COVID-19 related parameters: respiratory function and patients blood oxygenation in a simple manner, capable of detecting early symptoms, thus enabling proactive treatment rather than responsive. Its operation is supported by a smartphone application, via easy wireless Bluetooth connectivity and a platform for remote monitoring. The proposed device computes the mass flow by measuring the differential pressure in a venturi tube using a factory calibrated and temperature compensated differential pressure sensor. The latter is directly connected via a two-wire digital interface to the main control electronic board, and the obtained data are linearized. The venturi tube was preferred over a laminar flow restrictor, due to its simplicity and smooth easy to swipe surfaces despite its higher non-linear response characteristics. It is detachable from the whole device allowing easy disinfection or replacement, thus providing enhanced infection protection. The blood oxygenation and pulse rate are measured by an extremely sensitive and stable factory calibrated module, which includes internal LEDs, photodetectors, optical elements, and low-noise electronics with ambient light rejection. The device is entirely controlled by the smartphone and has no moving mechanical parts, displays, or buttons, thus offering high reliability and low production cost. The preliminary results showed that the proposed design solution is robust, user friendly and can deliver accurate and consistent respiratory and oximetry test results at the point of care, without the need for calibration. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Development of a Reliable Spiroximeter for Covid-19 Patients Telemonitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: North America is currently facing an opioid epidemics. Over 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased opioid usage and opioid-related deaths. Respiratory depression is the main cause of morbidity and mortality from opioids. We have previously shown that leptin acts as respiratory stimulant and prevents opioid-induced respiratory depression and upper airway obstruction without reducing analgesia. In this study, we aimed to examine if intranasal (IN) administration of leptin effectively delivers leptin to the brain and prevents opioid-related deaths. Methods: To determine leptin delivery to the brain male C57BL/6J mice, were treated with IN leptin at 1.2 mg/kg in 1% BSA (n=5) or 1% BSA (n=5) and sacrificed 20 min later. Brains were harvested, the olfactory bulbs, medullas and hypotalami were isolated, quick frozen and stored at-80C. For leptin level measurements, brain tissue was homogenized, protease inhibitors and protein concentrations were determined and ELISA was performed. To determine the survival probability, male C57BL/6J mice, 12 weeks of age, received IN leptin (n=26) or vehicle (n=25) at 1.2 mg/kg and 30 minutes later received a bolus of intraperitoneal (IP) morphine at 400mg/kg. Mice were video monitored for 24 hours and survival time after morphine injection was recorded Results: IN leptin significantly increased leptin levels in the olfactory bulb (from 0 ng/mL to 7.53 ng/mL, p = 0.004) and medulla (from 0.008 ng/mL to 0.107 ng/mL) and presented a trend in the hypothalamus (from 0.018 ng/mL to 0.291 ng/mL, p = 0.1). Mice that received IN leptin had a higher survival rate when compared to mice that received vehicle (69% vs 92%, p = 0.044, Figure).

The additional stressors created by the need to stay home and socially isolate may act as triggers to intimate partner violence (IPV). In this article, we present data from a recent online cross-sectional survey with gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States to illustrate changes in IPV risks that have occurred during the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May 2020. GBMSM were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 696 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes in victimization and perpetration of IPV during the 3 months prior to the survey (March-May 2020) that represents the first 3 months of lockdown during the COVID-19 epidemic. During the period March-May 2020, 12.6% of participants reported experiencing any IPV with higher rates of emotional IPV (10.3%) than sexual (2.2%) or physical (1.8%) IPV. Of those who reported IPV victimization during lockdown, for almost half this was their first time experience: 5.3% reported the IPV they experienced happened for the first time during the past 3 months (0.8% physical, 2.13% sexual, and 3.3% emotional). Reporting of perpetration of IPV during lockdown was lower: only 6% reported perpetrating any IPV, with perpetration rates of 1.5% for physical, 0.5% for sexual, and 5.3% for emotional IPV. Of those who reported perpetration of IPV during lockdown, very small percentages reported that this was the first time they had perpetrated IPV: 0.9% for any IPV (0.2% physical, 0.2% sexual, and 0.6% emotional). The results illustrate an increased need for IPV resources for GBMSM during these times of increased stress and uncertainty, and the need to find models of resource and service delivery that can work inside of social distancing guidelines while protecting the confidentiality and safety of those who are experiencing IPV.","output":"COVID-19 and the Risk for Increased Intimate Partner Violence Among Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is hard to predict what will have happened by the time of the conference, this round table will be tightly templated and coordinated Each speaker will briefly address the challenges experienced by that country and the actions taken, and focus on explaining why those actions happened in order to draw comparative lessons about public health politics and governance","output":"Responding to COVID19 in Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 on the U S healthcare industry cannot be overstated Telemedicine utilization increased overnight as all healthcare providers rushed to implement this delivery model to ensure accessibility and continuity of patient care Our research objective was to determine measures that were implemented to accommodate community and individual patient needs to afford access to critical services and to maintain safety standards We analyzed literature since 2016 from two databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) We compared observations, themes, service lines addressed, issues identified, and interventions requiring in-person care From 44 articles published, we identified ten effectiveness themes overall and drew conclusions on service line successes COVID-19 has caused rapid expansion in telemedicine Necessary and required changes in access, risk mitigation, the need for social distancing, compliance, cost, and patient satisfaction are a few of the driving factors This review showcased the healthcare industry&rsquo;s ability to rapidly acclimate and change despite the pervasive spread of COVID-19 throughout the U S Although imperfect, unique responses were developed within telemedicine platforms to mitigate disruptions broadly and effectively in care and treatment modalities","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Telemedicine Utilization Across Multiple Service Lines in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events leading to the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 have demonstrated the effective use of genomic sequencing technologies to establish the genetic sequence of this virus In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the absence of computational approaches to understand the molecular basis of this infection rapidly Here we present an integrated approach to the study of the nsp1 protein in SARS-CoV-1, which plays an essential role in maintaining the expression of viral proteins and further disabling the host protein expression, also known as the host shutoff mechanism We present three independent methods of evaluating two potential binding sites speculated to participate in host shutoff by nsp1 We have combined results from computed models of nsp1, with deep mining of all existing protein structures (using PDBMine), and binding site recognition (using msTALI) to examine the two sites consisting of residues 55-59 and 73-80 Based on our preliminary results, we conclude that the residues 73-80 appear as the regions that facilitate the critical initial steps in the function of nsp1 Given the 90% sequence identity between nsp1 from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conjecture the same critical initiation step in the function of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 ? 2020 ACM","output":"A Preliminary Investigation in the Molecular Basis of Host Shutoff Mechanism in SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the increased use of activity trackers, little is known about how they can be used in healthcare settings.

The aim of this study was to perform a follow-up cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on those patients, at 6 months after their hospitalization to find out if there are long-term cardio-pulmonary limitations (CPL) of Covid-19. We also wanted to check if there is any difference in outcome and CPL between patients who received oxygen therapy vs. without oxygen therapy. Methods: 40 patients were included into this study (16 women = 40%;24 men = 60%). All patients were hospitalized during their infection with Covid-19 (5 patients at ICU) and underwent CPET 62 month after discharge. 20 patients (50%) received oxygen therapy or ventilation during their hospitalization. CPET data were assessed at rest, during exercise and at recovery. Blood parameters including NT-pro BNP were collected and an interview and examination were performed. CPL was defined as VO2% of Predicted 84%, VE/CO2 Slope 34 and RER at peak of exercise 1.1. Results: Median age of all patients was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 35.3-55.8], median BMI was 26.0 m2/kg [IQR: 23.0-29.0] and the median NTproBNP was 53.1 pg/mL [IQR: 24.0-95.6]. When comparing the two groups, we found higher percentage of CPL in patients who received oxygen therapy during their hospitalization (10% with oxygen vs. 5% without oxygen). Notably, the number of patients with a BMI 25 m2/kg was higher in the oxygen therapy group than in those without oxygen (80% vs. 45%). The median BMI without oxygen therapy was 24.0 [IQR: 20.3-26.8] vs. 29.0 [IQR: 25.0-31.0] with oxygen therapy (p=0.004). There were no significant differences in NT-proBNP levels (p=0.545). The median VO2% of predicted was 88.0% [72.5-98.0] without oxygen therapy vs. 84.5% [IQR: 70.8-91.8] with oxygen therapy (p=0.289), the median HR percentage of predicted was 92.5% [IQR: 85.5-97.8] without oxygen therapy vs. 94.5% [IQR: 88.3-103.5] with oxygen therapy (p=0.478), the median physical performance in watt in patients without oxygen therapy was 130.0 [IQR: 108.5-197.5] vs. 135.0 [IQR: 97.0-188.3] with oxygen therapy (p=0.820). Conclusion: The findings of our study did not show any statistically significant difference in long-term CPL between patients who received oxygen therapy vs. those who didn't. Therefore, other causes of the exercise intolerance and dyspnoea have to be discussed multidisciplinary. Subclinical CPL in the absence of significant clinical symptoms represent a concern after a Covid-19 infection. Overall, 7.5% of our patients showed CPL although those patients didn't have any clinical symptoms. Therefore, CPET is a good method to discover asymptomatic patients with CPL.

Conspiratorial thinking is characterised by the strong conviction that a certain situation that one sees as unjust is the result of a deliberate conspiracy of a group of people with bad intentions. Conspiratorial thinking appears to have many similarities with paranoid delusions. AIM: To explore the nature, consequences, and social-psychological dimensions of conspiratorial thinking, and describe similarities and differences with paranoid delusions. METHOD: Critically assessing relevant literature about conspiratorial thinking and paranoid delusions. RESULTS: Conspiratorial thinking meets epistemic, existential, and social needs. It provides clarity in uncertain times and connection with an in-group of like-minded people. Both conspiratorial thinking and paranoid delusions involve an unjust, persistent, and sometimes bizarre conviction. Unlike conspiracy theorists, people with a paranoid delusion are almost always the only target of the presumed conspiracy, and they usually stand alone in their conviction. Furthermore, conspiracy theories are not based as much on unusual experiences of their inner self, reality, or interpersonal contacts. CONCLUSIONS Conspirational thinking is common in uncertain circumstances. It gives grip, certainty, moral superiority and social support. Extreme conspirational thinking seems to fit current psychiatric definitions of paranoid delusions, but there are also important differences. To make a distinction with regard to conspiratorial thinking, deepening of conventional definitions of delusions is required. Instead of the strong focus on the erroneous content of delusions, more attention should be given to the underlying idiosyncratic, changed way of experiencing reality.","output":"[Are conspiracy theorists psychotic?

To address these challenges, systematic approaches such as psychosocial risk assessments (PRA) have been developed in many countries worldwide. Despite legal obligations, psychosocial risk assessments are rarely carried out in micro and small-sized enterprises (MSE). Even though those enterprises constitute a large proportion of the general workforce, this area remains largely untouched by research. In order to enable starting points for a greater dissemination in organizational practice, the present study explores barriers and drivers of psychosocial risk assessments in micro and small-sized enterprises. METHODS: A total of 18 owners and managers from 15 micro and small-sized enterprises in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, were interviewed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. A qualitative approach was applied: Content analysis was used to analyze the data, using deductive as well as inductive coding techniques. RESULTS: The following barriers emerged from the interviews: Negative PRA image, stigmatization of mental health, lacking acceptance of employees, fear of excessive authority interference, ignorance of PRA, not understanding the necessity, inappropriate approach, and limited resources. The identified drivers were: Easy access to PRA material, external support from experts, renaming the term workplace risk assessment, understanding content and benefit of PRA, simplify and revise PRA process, and noticeable consequences of PRA execution and non-execution. The results are comparable with those in larger companies. They emphasize the importance of mental health education, improving the process of psychosocial risk assessments, and the ongoing support in overcoming limited financial as well as human resources. CONCLUSIONS: To improve implementation of PRA in organizational practice, a simplification of the process is proposed, accompanied by information campaigns and an improvement in the health literacy of owners and managers of MSE.

We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 in each drug exposure group. We used Cox proportional hazards models to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19. We assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The incidence rate of COVID-19 among users of ACE inhibitors and CCBs was 9.3 per 1000 person-years (83 of 18,895 users [0.44%]) and 9.5 per 1000 person-years (85 of 18,895 [0.45%]), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). The incidence rate among users of ARBs was 15.8 per 1000 person-years (79 out of 10,623 users [0.74%]). The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of RAS inhibitors and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant increase compared to the use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension: a propensity score-matched cohort study in primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is putting the NHS under unprecedented pressure, requiring clinicians to make uncomfortable decisions they would not ordinarily face.

Moreover, PDL-1/PDL-2 ligands were increased on skin macrophages compared to healthy controls. The proportions PD1(+), but not TIM-3 or CTLA-4 expressing T cells in the circulation were positively correlated with those in the lesions of the same patients, suggesting that PD-1 may regulate T cell function equally in both compartments.

Little is known about the mental health impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in sub-Saharan Africa or other low-resource settings. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between August and November 2020 among HCWs recruited from three major hospitals in Kenya. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components: demographic and work title characteristics; information regarding care of patients with COVID-19; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardised questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. RESULTS: A total of 433 (65.2% response rate) individuals participated in the survey. Median age was 32.75 years, 58.4% were females and 68.8% were front-line workers. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout were reported in 53.6%, 44.3%, 41.1%, 31.0% and 45.8% of all participants, respectively. Front-line HCWs, females and doctors were at higher risk of mental health symptoms. Nearly half of participants reported inadequate resources or training to care for patients with COVID-19, and those in the government hospital were more likely to report mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This is among the first studies examining mental health outcomes among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, HCWs directly involved with patients with COVID-19 reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Mitigating strategies specific to Kenyan HCWs are urgently needed to help them cope with mental health symptoms during the pandemic.","output":"Mental health disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey from three major hospitals in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the Covid-19 Virus which has a major impact on various sectors of human life, from health problems that have caused many deaths and also economic impacts The decline in people's purchasing power has caused the industry to experience a decrease in sales turnover, causing business actors to carry out budget efficiency by terminating employment In terms of assisting government programs in assisting victims of layoffs, a system for mapping the locations of these victims is needed In building a mapping system for the location of victims of layoffs using the XP method which is part of agille The system can display the location area down to the districts level By using a system of mapping the locations of dismissed communities, it can assist in data collection and distribution of assistance ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Development of Mapping Area Software for Dismissal People Affected by Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mortality rates of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continue to rise across the world. The impact of several risk factors on coronavirus mortality has been previously reported in several meta\\\\analyses limited by small sample sizes. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarize available findings on the association between comorbidities, complications, smoking status, obesity, gender, age and D-dimer, and risk of mortality from COVID-19 using a large dataset from a number of studies. METHOD: Electronic databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences (WOS), EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, COVID-19 Research Database, and Scopus, were systematically searched till 31 August 2020. We included all human studies regardless of language, publication date or region. Forty-two studies with a total of 423,117 patients met the inclusion criteria. To pool the estimate, a mixed-effect model was used. Moreover, publication bias and sensitivity analysis were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings of the included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of comorbidities, gender, age, smoking status, obesity, acute kidney injury, and D-dimer as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. The analysis results showed that the pooled prevalence of mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 17.62% (95% CI 14.26C21.57%, 42 studies and 423,117 patients). Older age has shown increased risk of mortality due to coronavirus and the pooled odds ratio (pOR) and hazard ratio (pHR) were 2.61 (95% CI 1.75C3.47) and 1.31 (95% CI 1.11C1.51), respectively. A significant association were found between COVID-19 mortality and male (pOR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.41C1.51; pHR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.07C1.41), and current smoker (pOR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.01C1.83). Furthermore, risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is highly influenced by patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, obese, cancer, acute kidney injury and increase D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Chronic comorbidities, complications, and demographic variables including acute kidney injury, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, cancer, increased D-dimer, male gender, older age, current smoker, and obesity are clinical risk factors for a fatal outcome associated with coronavirus.

The study aims to assess the compliance of public hospitals and temporary treatment and monitoring facilities (TTMFs) to IPC standards for COVID-19. Methods A baseline assessment survey was conducted between July 20 to August 18, 2020, from selected facilities in 38 local government units (LGU) across the country utilising a 35-point questionnaire corresponding to a set of standards issued by the Philippine Department of Health. Results The study shows that public hospitals reported sufficient IPC preparedness and compliance compared to TTMFs in the domains of engineering and administrative controls. Both types of facilities reported weak compliance in the use of color-coded bags and in having a central storage for infectious waste. In addition, among TTMFs adherence to proper labelling of waste bins, presence of instructional materials for waste disposal, directional signages for movements of HCWs and patients, availability of an IPC policy, and advocacy materials on proper handwashing, respiratory etiquette, and physical distancing, and PPE use were also low. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of IPC preparedness among health care facilities to effectively prevent disease transmission and mitigate its impact on the health care system.

However, endotracheal intubation is the primary method considered as the standard of care in neonatal resuscitation. LMA insertion is a relatively simple procedure with an average insertion time of < 10 seconds. Newer generation LMA can have the added advantage of reducing the risk of aerosol generation and improving the safety of the providers. Only a few recent studies have evaluated the LMA insertion skills of neonatal resuscitation providers. We wanted to study the proficiency of NRP providers in the technique of LMA insertion. We hypothesized that NRP providers would have LMA insertion skills equivalent to the standard of care (ETT insertion). STUDY DESIGN: A manikin-based study was done from July 2019 to December 2019. We enrolled 31 NRP providers with 1 or more years since the first certification and current valid NRP provider/instructor status. The participants were instructed to insert an ETT and LMA in the manikin. The procedures were video recorded. The time taken to insert and start ventilation with each device, including the number of attempts for successful insertion, was noted. A Likert scale questionnaire was filled by each participant indicating the level of confidence, perception of ease, and the ability to provide effective positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with each of the procedures. The paired t-test, chi-square test, and Kruskal-Wallis' test were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS Eight (25.8%) out of the 31 participants failed to insert any one of the devices. So, 23 providers were analyzed for the outcomes. We found that the mean duration taken to insert the ETT and LMA was not statistically different (32 vs. 36 seconds). LMA insertion had a higher failure rate compared with ETT. Providers did not perceive confidence to insert LMA when compared with ETT. They did not recognize LMA insertion as a more effortless procedure relative to endotracheal intubation. The providers felt that their ability to provide effective PPV using LMA was inferior to ETT. CONCLUSION The NRP certified providers in this study did not demonstrate proficiency in the insertion of LMA equivalent to the endotracheal intubation.

In addition, the indirect effect of different types of Internet use was evaluated, that is, they were considered as mediator variables. RESULTS: Effort expectancy, social influence, and ageism predicted different types of Internet use. The relationship between effort expectancy and anxious symptomatology had an indirect effect via information seeking, whereas the relationship between ageism and anxious symptomatology showed an indirect effect via leisure. DISCUSSION: The findings support the importance of differentiating the types of Internet use to understand its impact on psychological well-being. Information seeking is associated with anxious symptomatology and is predicted by effort expectancy. On the contrary, leisure is crucial because of its relationship with anxious symptomatology, and less ageism can promote it.

METHODS Air samples were collected from 7 wards and 1 balcony of the Hospital, 3 times a day for 3 continuous days, using bioaerosol sampler type FA-2. Bioaerosol particles were then washed down from the samples by serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) culture medium. Nested-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the N protein gene of the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from these washing solutions. The residual solutions were inoculated into prepared cell cultures to isolate live virus. The positive samples were then identified by indirect immunofluorescence assay and sequence analysis of the PCR products. RESULTS Positive rates of RT-PCR test on air samples were 29.03% in the wards and 20.0% in balcony respectively. Results from sequential analysis showed that the homology of amplified cDNA fragments to previously known SARS-CoV stains was 98%. A strain of live pathogen was isolated from one of the 36 samples. The isolate could cause typical cytopathic effects, similar to those SARS-CoV on Vero-E6 cells and the effects could be stably passed.

Sustained mTORC1 activity favors the generation of terminally differentiated effector T cells instead of follicular helper and memory T cells. This is particularly pertinent for T cell responses of older adults who have sustained mTORC1 activation despite dysfunctional lysosomes. Here, we show that lysosome-deficient T cells rely on late endosomes rather than lysosomes as an mTORC1 activation platform, where mTORC1 is activated by sensing cytosolic amino acids. T cells from older adults have an increased expression of the plasma membrane leucine transporter SLC7A5 to provide a cytosolic amino acid source. Hence, SLC7A5 and VPS39 deficiency (a member of the HOPS complex promoting early to late endosome conversion) substantially reduced mTORC1 activities in T cells from older but not young individuals. Late endosomal mTORC1 is independent of the negative-feedback loop involving mTORC1-induced inactivation of the transcription factor TFEB that controls expression of lysosomal genes. The resulting sustained mTORC1 activation impaired lysosome function and prevented lysosomal degradation of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells from older adults, thereby inhibiting their proliferative responses. VPS39 silencing of human T cells improved their expansion to pertussis and to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of CD4+ Vps39-deficient LCMV-specific SMARTA cells improved germinal center responses, CD8+ memory T cell generation, and recall responses to infection. Thus, curtailing late endosomal mTORC1 activity is a promising strategy to enhance T cell immunity.","output":"Activation of mTORC1 at late endosomes misdirects T cell fate decision in older individuals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through grassroots research, media-making, and public events, cr documented and publicized the carceral strategies of disaster racism that city and state officials had attempted to keep out of view. cr demonstrated that the city's turn to law and order as disaster management was a magnification of the everyday operations of the opp - a key node of state racism before, during, and after the storm.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 437 consecutive patients who presented with VAs for RFCA, twenty-six patients with acute successful RFCA at the SP-MA were included in this study. The ratio of the amplitude of the first positive peak (if present) versus the nadir in the unipolar electrogram (EGM) was 0.00-0.03 (0.00) at the acute successful RFCA site. The time interval between the QRS onset and the maximum descending slope (D-Max) in the unipolar EGM (QRS-Uni) was 18.8  13.6 ms. With bipolar mapping, the ventricular QRS (V-QRS) interval was 3.75-17.3 (11) ms, 6 (23.1%) patients showed the earliest V-QRS interval of 0 ms, and the other 20 patients (76.9%) showed a V-QRS interval of 10-54 ms. The RFCA start-to-effect time was 14.1  7.2 s in 23 patients (88.5%). In the remaining 3 patients (11.5%), the mean duration of successful RFCA was not well defined due to the infrequent nature of clinical VAs during RFCA. Early (within 3 days) and late (1-year) recurrence rates were 23.1% (6 patients) and 26.9% (7 patients), respectively. VAs disappeared 3 days later due to delayed RFCA efficacy in 2 patients (7.7%). No complications occurred during the RFCA procedure or the one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: SP-MA VAs are a rare but distinct subgroup of VAs. Bipolar and unipolar EGM features can help to determine the optimal RFCA site, and the QRS-Uni interval may serve as a marker that could be used to guide RFCA.","output":"Electrocardiographic and electrophysiological characteristics of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with acute successful ablation at the superior portion of the mitral annulus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Wuhan city, China, a pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin triggered a catastrophe.

Both datasets have shown a significant decrease in the levels of PM2.5 pollutions across Pakistan (ranging from 15 to 35% for satellite observations, while 27 to 61% for ground-based observations). The result shows that poor air quality is one of the key factors for a higher COVID-19 spread rate in major Pakistani cities. By extending the same investigation across the nation, there is a greater need to investigate the connections between COVID-19 spread and air pollution.

Highest titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and most potent neutralization activity were observed for an alternating immunization regimen using RBD-decorated OMVs from ETEC and V. cholerae in turn. These results highlight the versatile vaccine applications offered by OMVs via expression of heterologous antigens in the donor bacterium.","output":"An Intranasal Vaccine Based on Outer Membrane Vesicles Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ecological and evolutionary processes govern the fitness, propagation, and interactions of organisms through space and time, and viruses are no exception.

To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5  5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone \\"Screen Time\\" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study.

Several diseases have increased circulating and urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, but there is little information about changes in ACEs activity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE We examined circulating and urinary ACE 1 activity in children with SCD. METHODS This cross-sectional study compared children who were carriers of SCD with children who comprised a control group (CG). Serum and urinary activities of ACE were evaluated, as were biochemical factors, urinary album/creatinine rates, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS Urinary ACE activity was significantly higher in patients with SCD than in healthy children (median 0.01; range 0.00-0.07 vs median 0.00; range 0.00-0.01 mU/mLcreatinine, p < 0.001.

Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals' health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages.

Methods: Female COVID-19 patients of reproductive age were recruited between January 28 and March 8, 2020 from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan. Their baseline and clinical characteristics, as well as menstrual conditions, were recorded. Differentials in ovarian reserve markers and sex hormones (including anti-Mllerian hormone [AMH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], the ratio of FSH to luteinizing hormone [LH], estradiol [E2], progesterone [P], testosterone [T], and prolactin [PRL] were compared to those of healthy women who were randomly selected and individually matched for age, region, and menstrual status. Uni- and multi-variable hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with ovarian function in COVID-19 women. Results: Seventy eight patients agreed to be tested for serum hormone, of whom 17 (21.79%) were diagnosed as the severe group and 39 (50%) were in the basal level group. Menstrual status (P = 0.55), menstrual volumes (P = 0.066), phase of menstrual cycle (P = 0.58), and dysmenorrhea history (P = 0.12) were similar without significant differences between non-severe and severe COVID-19 women. Significant lower serum AMH level/proportion (0.19/0.28 vs. 1.12 ng/ml, P = 0.003/0.027; AMH  1.1 ng/ml: 75/70.4 vs. 49.7%, P = 0.009/0.004), higher serum T (0.38/0.39 vs. 0.22 ng/ml, P < 0.001/0.001) and PRL (25.43/24.10 vs. 12.12 ng/ml, P < 0.001/0.001) levels were observed in basal level and the all-COVID-19 group compared with healthy age-matched control. When adjusted for age, menstrual status and parity variations in multivariate hierarchical linear regression analysis, COVID-19 disease was significantly associated with serum AMH ( = ?0.191; 95% CI: ?1.177C0.327; P = 0.001), T ( = 0.411; 95% CI: 11.154C22.709; P < 0.001), and PRL ( = 0.497; 95% CI: 10.787C20.266; P < 0.001), suggesting an independent risk factor for ovarian function, which accounted for 3.2% of the decline in AMH, 14.3% of the increase in T, and 20.7% of the increase in PRL.

METHODS: Using a standardised protocol, we performed an analysis of available data and financing structures for health research and HPSR, based on research in eight countries, including interviews with key stakeholders (n = 42). RESULTS: Dollar depreciation and gross national product growth in the region may play a role in how governments fund research. There have been shifts in the political spectrum in governments, which have affected research coordination and funding in positive and negative ways. HPSR funding in some countries was dependent on budget decisions and although some have improved funding, others have regressed by decreasing funding or have completely cancelled financing mechanisms. Caribbean countries rely mainly on institutional funding. HPSR is recognised as important but remains underfunded; stakeholders believed it should be used more in decision making. CONCLUSION: Although HPSR is recognised as valuable for decision making and policy development, it does not have the financial support required to flourish in Latin America and the Carribean. Data on health research financing were not easy to access. There was little or no evidence of published reports or papers about research financing, health research funding, and HPSR funding in particular in the studied countries.

However, NNs are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is believed to be the most effective method while due to the intensive computation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement scheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the intuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples can contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most informative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT significantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves two breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of adversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich the information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight estimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the diversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is faster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect.","output":"Case-Aware Adversarial Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our personal views about the challenges of continuing to deliver peer teaching during a pandemic.

Bilateral viral conjunctivitis is an initial symptom in some other cases. It is therefore, vital to understand whether the eye can be directly infected by the virus, as well as the consequences of the viral infection in the ocular tissue. 2019-nCoV invades human cells primarily by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.

This paper hypothesized that lower serum 25(OH)D concentration in COVID 19 patients is associated with longer viral clearance time (VCT) and higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design/methodology/approach: This study used a retrospective cohort design of patients admitted to Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain, from February to June 2020. This study included patients with positive, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis made using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), World Health Organization diagnosis manual and local diagnostic guidelines. Primary outcome measures were: VCT measured as the time in days between the first positive RT-PCR test result and the first of two consecutive negative RT-PCR results on recovery and admission need to ICU. Findings: A total of 450 patients were analyzed;mean age was 46.4  12.4 years and 349 (78%) were men. Mean 25(OH)D concentration was 41.7  23.7 nmol/L for the entire sample. Severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was present in 20%, mild-to-moderate deficiency (25C50 nmol/L) in 55%, insufficiency (50 to <75 nmol/L) in 18% and sufficiency (=75 nmol/L) in 7%. The mean VCT was 12.9  8.2 days. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with longer VCT, with an average of three extra days after correction for age and sex ( = 3.1;p = 0.001). Multinomial regression analysis showed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with an 83% increased risk of admission to ICU after correction for age and sex (odds ratio = 1.8;p = 0.03). Originality/value: The results showed that severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with longer recovery time from COVID-19.

This RSV F recombinant nanoparticle vaccine adsorbed to 0.4 mg of aluminum phosphate was ultimately administered by a single intramuscular injection during the third trimester of pregnancy in an effort to induce passive immunity in newborns. Its mechanism, performance in clinical trials, and place in RSV vaccine history are discussed. EXPERT OPINION The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated in pregnant women and the results suggest potential benefits with respect to other medically relevant end-point events involving RSV-associated respiratory and all-cause disease in infants. However, the RSV-F recombinant nanoparticle vaccine did not meet the pre-specified primary success criteria for efficacy against RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to 90 days of life.

LncRNA XIST (XIST) is a lung cancer-related gene and participates in pneumonia. However, whether XIST participates in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI remains unclear. LPS-induced inflammation model was constructed in vitro, then cell viability, cytokines, cell apoptosis, protein, and mRNA expressions were individually detected by cell counting kit-8, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the relationships among XIST, miR-132-3p, and MAPK14. Furthermore, inflammation and conditions after knockdown of XIST were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents using LPS-induced in vivo model. Our findings indicated that the LPS challenge decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and caused secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Noticeably, LPS significantly upregulated XIST, MAPK14, and downregulated miR-132-3p. Mechanistically, XIST acted as a molecular sponge to suppress miR-132-3p, and MAPK14 was identified as a target of miR-132-3p. Functional analyses demonstrated that XIST silencing remarkably increased cell survival and alleviated cell death and lung injury through decreasing TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, accumulation of inflammatory cells, alveolar hemorrhage, MDA release, and increased PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, as well as upregulating Bcl-2, and downregulating Bax, MAPK14, and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinases ?.

A negative impact has made local farmers struggle to find their means of income other than selling their crops to their customers. The customers have had difficulties searching for good quality fresh produce other than from the supermarket. The purpose of this paper is twofold: firstly, to assess the manual and existing system on how consumers acquire their fresh produce during the Covid-19 pandemic, to design and implement a delivery system for local farmers to vend their fresh produce through a mobile application;and secondly, to test and evaluate the usability and functionality of the online farmers' market application. The existing mobile applications have changed everyone's approach in acquiring the daily essentials that the pandemic has brought. Therefore, the idea of developing an online marketplace for local farmers resulted in the proposed application, which will be explained in this paper. Rapid Application Development (RAD) was used as the methodology for the development of the eMarket application. A survey was conducted via Google form for twenty local farmers and another twenty potential customers during the pre-development stage. It was to collect data on the users' opinions regarding the proposed application. We then conducted the usability testing through Google form to collect the users' feedback on the eMarket application. Ten local farmers from Matang's market have participated in the testing phase.

Settlement services literacy (SSL) is key to ensuring new migrants have the capability to access and utilise the information and services designed to support the resettlement process and achieve positive settlement outcomes. To date, however, no research has sought to empirically validate measures of SSL or to assess individual migrants levels of SSL. The aim of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of constructs from the conceptual SSL framework. DESIGN: Using a snowball sampling approach, trained multilingual research assistants collected data on 653 participants. The total sample was randomly divided into two split-half samples: one for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA; N = 324) and the other for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; N = 329) and scale validation. The final SSL scale included 30 questions. The full data set was used to test the nomological validity of the scale regarding whether the components of SSL impact on migrants level of acculturative stress. RESULTS: The EFA yielded five factors: knowledge (eight items,  = 0.88), empowerment (five items,  = 0.89), competence (four items,  = 0.86), community influence (four items,  = 0.82), and political (two items,  = 0.81). In the CFA, the initial model demonstrated a poor to marginal fit model. Its re-specification by examining modification indices resulted in a good model fit: CMIN/DF = 3.07, comparative fit index = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation = 0.08 and standardised root mean square residual = 0.07, which are consistent with recommendations. All the path coefficients between the second-order construct (SSL) and its five dimensions (knowledge, empowerment, competence, community influence and political) were significant at an  = .05 level, giving evidence for the validity of different SSL dimensions. We found that SSL is significantly related to migrants acculturative stress ( = - 0.39, p < 0.05) in the nomological model. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of the construct validity and reliability of the SSL tool. It provides the basis for integrating the measures of SSL into evaluation of settlement services. This will allow for more effective decision-making in designing and implementing settlement services as well as funding and service agreements to address any deficiencies.","output":"Establishing the psychometric properties of constructs from the conceptual Settlement Services Literacy framework and their relationship with migrants acculturative stress in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe strict visiting rules imposed by hospitals during the COVID-19 lockdown left patients isolated and relatives distressed by the lack of contact. The aim of this quality improvement project was to improve patient communication with relatives, thereby enhancing their recovery and experience.MethodIn-patients at St Marys Hospital, London were asked if they were able to contact their loved ones and if there was appropriate technology available to facilitate this. Teaching was then delivered to healthcare professionals highlighting the importance of patient communication with friends and family, and posters were displayed to promote communication opportunities. Additional equipment was procured (through donations) to aid the process. A second data collection was conducted after 3 weeks.ResultsThe initial results revealed that 30% of patients were unable to communicate with their relatives, and only 16.6% were being offered the opportunity to contact them. Comments following the initial data collection included: I feel isolated because my family cant visit, and I dont have a mobile phone, and, the ward staff are too busy to call my family on the ward phone. After the intervention 73.3% were offered the opportunity to contact relatives. There was a significant increase in use of the ward phone and video calls. This had an increase in both patient and family satisfaction;for example, a patient was able to ask a friend to deliver their belongings, and a daughter of a patient with dementia was able to encourage him to eat via a video call.ConclusionProactive use of technologies in healthcare settings can improve patient care.

Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. METHODS: We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. RESULTS: Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced 1 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 171, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). CONCLUSION: Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation. Future research could investigate whether medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination may be improved by acknowledging patient experiences, counseling regarding different types of ARI, and correcting the misperception that all ARI occurring after vaccination are caused by influenza.","output":"Assessment of temporally-related acute respiratory illness following influenza vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The role of vaccination as the cause/trigger/aggravation factor for FS or epilepsies and preventive measures were analyzed. RESULTS: From 1428 results, 846 duplicates and 447 irrelevant articles were eliminated; 120 were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that vaccinations cause epilepsy in healthy populations. Vaccinations do not cause epileptic encephalopathies but may be non-specific triggers to seizures in underlying structural or genetic etiologies. The first seizure in DS may be earlier in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients, but developmental outcome is similar in both groups. Children with a personal or family history of FS or epilepsy should receive all routine vaccinations. This recommendation includes DS. The known risks of the infectious diseases prevented by immunization are well established. Vaccination should be deferred in case of acute illness. Acellular pertussis DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is recommended. The combination of certain vaccine types may increase the risk of febrile seizures however the public health benefit of separating immunizations has not been proven. Measles-containing vaccine should be administered at age 12-15 months. Routine prophylactic antipyretics are not indicated, as there is no evidence of decreased FS risk and they can attenuate the antibody response following vaccination.

METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation).

Of the 407 HCWs enrolled, 334 (82.1%) were SARS-CoV-2-naive and 73 (17.9%) SARS-CoV-2-experienced. Post-vaccine humoral response was detectable in more than 98% of HCWs. Overall, the median level of anti-S IgG in SARS-COV-2-experienced HCWs was twice as high as those of SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects (24641.0 AU/mL [IQR: 15273.0C>40000.0] versus 13053.8 [IQR: 7303.3C20105.8]; p < .001), irrespective of the time elapsed from SARS-CoV-2 previous infection. In a subgroup of SARS-CoV-2-naive and -experienced subjects who received only one dose of the vaccine, the latter showed 32 times higher levels of anti-S IgG compared to the former.

METHODS This study is a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 39 emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants randomized to the intervention group were given access to the T1D Financial Toolkit, an online financial and health insurance education toolkit, over 30 days. For the present analysis, feasibility was assessed by enrollment and attrition. Optional, qualitative interviews were conducted upon the conclusion of the intervention to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction, and key recommendations for improvement. RESULTS Of the 39 participants who enrolled, 36 completed the study. The intervention period had 100% completion in both the control and intervention groups. Eleven participants from the intervention group completed interviews. Participants described few challenges accessing the toolkit and were highly satisfied with the intervention aesthetics, display, and content. Key recommendations included integrating more applied problem-solving into the experience of watching the videos. CONCLUSIONS The T1D Financial Toolkit is a financial and health insurance education intervention tailored to emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. This resource is feasible, acceptable, and satisfactory. Diabetes care and education specialists can utilize this tool in practice to provide relevant, developmentally tailored education to emerging adults with type 1 diabetes, prompt applied problem-solving, reduce barriers to self-management, and improve psychosocial outcomes.","output":"The Feasibility and Acceptability of a Community-Developed Health Insurance and Financial Toolkit for Emerging Adults With Type 1 Diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the impact of the recent restrictions/bans imposed by several nations on air travel to India in the light of the increasing number of infections amid the second wave of COVID-19.

This measure aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus and the resulting severe respira-tory condition that frequently besets older adults. However, this measure can also affect the support networks of these isolated people. Objectives To explore the emerging needs related to the mental health of isolated older adults in this period and to identify the main support networks they have and the emerging coping strategies in the face of the situation. Methodology We carried out an exploratory qualitative study, summoning participants over 60 years of age. Using snowball sampling, a group of researchers contacted them by phone to collect data. The analysis of the findings was triangulated among researchers with different academic backgrounds (medicine, psychology, and sociology). The concepts emerging from the interviews were linked in conceptual networks using an inductive methodology and were mapped into conceptual frameworks available to researchers. Atlas.ti 8 software was used for coding. Results Thirty-nine participants belonging to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were interviewed between April and July 2020. For greater clarity, the main themes were described in five cross-sectional axes: network configurations, resources and coping strategies, affective states and emo-tions, perceptions and reflections on the future, and actions emerging from the participatory approach. Participants reported distress, anxiety, anger, uncertainty, exhaustion, and expressed fear of contagion from themselves and their loved ones. We identify greater vulnerability in people living alone, in small and closed environments, with weak linkages and networks, or limited access to technologies. We also found vari-ous coping strategies and technology was a fundamental factor in maintaining the bonds. Conclusions The findings of this research have implications for decision-making at the individual level, health systems, professional care, and policy devel-opment.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of teleconsultations provided in the department of Strabismus, Paediatric and Neuro-ophthalmology was done. Patients with optic nerve related disorders were excluded. Study period was one month. Statistical analysis of collected data was done using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients were provided teleconsultations (an average of seven teleconsultations/day). The final analysis included 161 patients after excluding optic nerve related disorders. The median age was seven years. We had a near equal gender distribution (53% males and 47% females) of whom a third were new cases. Video calling was used in 14%, review of clinical photos shared was used in 53%. Rest of the 33% were given telephonic advice. Allergic conjunctivitis (14%), pseudophakia (9%), strabismus (12%), status post strabismus surgery (8%), cranial nerve palsies (11%) were common diagnoses. 19% (n = 30) were advised/needed visit in emergency services on same or next day. CONCLUSION: Our experience of teleconsultation during COVID-19 times for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus patients was very encouraging. Pivoting teleconsultation platform can provide primary eye care to most of the patients and work as essential forward triage for rest.

Self-determination theory describes three psychological needs which promote intrinsic motivation. This paper describes, evaluates and justifies a remotely conducted, post-COVID-19 histopathology placement designed to foster intrinsic motivation. METHODS 90 fourth-year medical students took part in combined synchronous and asynchronous remote placements integrating virtual microscopy into complete patient narratives through Google Classroom, culminating in remote, simulated multidisciplinary team meeting sessions allowing participants to vote on 'red flag' signs and symptoms, investigations, histological diagnoses, staging and management of simulated virtual patients. The placement was designed to foster autonomy, competence and relatedness, generating authenticity, transdisciplinary integration and clinical relevance. A postpositivistic evaluation was undertaken with a validated preplacement and postplacement questionnaire capturing quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS There was a significant (p<0.001) improvement in interest, confidence and competence in histopathology. Clinical integration and relevance, access to interactive resources and collaborative learning promoted engagement and sustainability post-COVID-19. Barriers to online engagement included participant lack of confidence and self-awareness in front of peers. CONCLUSIONS Fostering autonomy, competence and relatedness in post-COVID-19, remote educational designs can promote intrinsic motivation and authentic educational experiences. Ensuring transdisciplinary clinical integration, the appropriate use of novel technology and a focus on patient narratives can underpin the relevance of undergraduate histopathology education.

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. Methods: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participants county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. Results: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased. Conclusions: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.","output":"Actual versus Perceived Infection Rates of COVID-19: Impact on Distress, Behavior and Disability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has claimed innumerous lives globally resulting in increased stress affecting woman's menstrual, sexual, and mental health, an area of significant concern.

Very low concentrations of viral particles and RNA present in the complicated wastewater and sewage sample matrix require efficient sample processing and sensitive detection. We discuss advantages and limitations of available methods for wastewater sample processing, including collection, separation, enrichment, RNA extraction, and purification. Efficient extraction of the viral RNA and removal of interfering sample matrices are critical to the subsequent reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. We emphasize the importance of implementing appropriate controls and method validation, which include the use of surrogate viruses for assessing extraction efficiency and normalization against measurable chemical and biological components in wastewater.

COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. Exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no there were significant peak expiratory flow changes. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations. The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations.","output":"Chapter 67 Acute Exacerbations of COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSEOF REVIEW: This review highlights six best practices for cancer epidemiology coordinating centers to facilitate the success of a research consortium.

MEASURES: Measures include perceived COVID-19 related discrimination, fear of COVID-19 infection, prior exposure to COVID-19, and prior social distancing behavior. Participants self-reported attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and perceived norms related to social distancing. Finally, we measured social distancing behavioral intention. ANALYSIS: We evaluated a theory of planned behavior (TPB) measurement model of social distancing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The association between COVID-19 perceived discrimination, fear of infection, previous social distancing behavior, exposure to COVID-19, TPB constructs and behavioral intentions to social distance were estimated using SEM path analysis.

METHODS At Lillebaelt Hospital, the cardiologist on-call evaluated and entered the transmitted ECGs and the associated transmission criteria into the Clinical Measurement System database (KMS). Furthermore, data from the KMS and the diagnoses at discharge were obtained from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS A total of 9,751 ECGs were included in the study. ECG transmission increased by 35% from year one to year three (p less-than 0.05). A total of 362 patients (3.7%) had STEMI. 25% of all ECGs were transmitted without any obvious cardiac symptom but produced a diagnosis of other cardiac illnesses than acute coronary syndrome in 28% of these patients.

More recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as a valid alternative method of support and has been our preferred method of support since March 2012. We compared early and midterm outcomes of these 2 support methods. METHODS Between July 2007 and April 2013, 271 consecutive patients underwent lung transplant using CPB (n = 222) or ECMO (n = 49). We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of these patients requiring CPB or ECMO during lung transplant. RESULTS The CPB and ECMO groups had comparable demographic and operative characteristics; however, the ECMO group had higher mean lung allocation scores (73 vs 52, p < 0.001). In the CPB group, more patients required reintubation (35.6% vs 20.4%, p = 0.04) or temporary tracheostomy (44.6% vs 28.6%, p = 0.05). Patients in the CPB group had a higher rate of renal failure requiring dialysis than the ECMO group (22.1% vs 8.2 %, p = 0.028). There were no differences in severe PGD requiring postoperative circulatory support (p = 0.83) or the need for perioperative red blood cell transfusions (p = 0.64) between the groups. No differences in 30-day (5% CPB vs 4.1% ECMO) or 6-month mortality (14.4% CPB vs 14.3% ECMO) were noted. CONCLUSIONS The use of ECMO in lung transplant is safe and in our experience was associated with decreased rates of pulmonary and renal complications, as compared with CPB.

A major confounding factor in fatality rate estimates is the survival time (time from diagnosis to death). Predictive models that incorporate the survival time benefit from greater accuracy due to the elimination of sampling bias. This study outlines a survival time-based predictive model that estimates a precise fatality rate for patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This model was utilised to predict deaths for COVID-19 patients who died during the first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in England. Methodology This study included Public Health England (PHE) data for cumulative laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 143,463) and deaths (n = 30,028) that were reported by PHE between 30 January and 14 May 2020 in England, that is, from the first COVID-19 case in England and the most recently available data at the time of conducting this study. Fatality rate and survival time were estimated by linear regression analysis. This enabled the predicted cumulative COVID-19 deaths to be calculated up to 21 May 2020. Time periods with significantly different rates in daily deaths were identified using Joinpoint trend analysis. Results A fatality rate of 21.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.8% to 22.0%) with a survival time of seven days was determined for patients in England with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on these estimates, predicted trends for cumulative and daily laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were generated with >99% and >96% accuracy with reported data, respectively. This model predicted that the number of cumulative laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths in England was likely to be 31,420 by 21 May 2020. Joinpoint trend analysis identified significant differences in predicted daily laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths during the following periods: 10.5 (6 to 17 March), 111.0 (17 to 27 March), 446.8 (27 March to 4 April), 817.0 (4 to 23 April), 536.3 (23 April to 7 May), and 266.7 (7 to 21 May) daily deaths (P < 0.001). Conclusions During the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England, the fatality rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was 21.9%. The survival time of these patients was seven days. The predictive model presented in this study can be adapted for estimating COVID-19 deaths in different geographical regions. As such, this study has utility for clinicians, scientists, and policymakers responding to new waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection because the methodology can be applied to more recent time periods as new data for COVID-19 cases and deaths become available.","output":"Fatality Rate and Survival Time of Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 for Patients in England During the First Wave of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To date, there exists no gold standard conservative treatment for lateral hip pain due to tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and/or minimus tendon (GT), a condition often complicated by pain and disability. Higher loads during everyday activities and exercise seems to be contraindicated with GT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of exercise with low-loads concurrent partial blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) and patient education for patients present GT. METHODS: Recruitment took place at three hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. The intervention consisted of daily sessions for 8 weeks with one weekly supervised session. From week three patients exercised with applied partial blood flow restriction by means of a pneumatic cuff around the proximal thigh of the affected leg. Throughout the intervention patients received patient education on their hip condition. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected at baseline. The feasibility of LL-BFR was conducted by adherence to the exercise protocol and drop-out rate. Patient reported outcome measures (The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal Questionnaire, EuroQol - 5 Dimensions-Visual Analogue Scale, Oxford Hip Score, Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score), maximal voluntary isometric hip abduction-, hip extension, and knee extension strength (Nm/kg) measured using a handheld dynamometer, and functional capacity tests (30 second chair-stand test and a stair-climb test) was conducted as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen women with a median (IQR) age of 51 (46C60) years were included. Median (IQR) Body Mass Index was 26.69 (23.59C30.46) kg/m2. Adherence to the total number of training sessions and the LL-BFR was 96.4 and 94.4%, respectively. Two patients dropped out due to (i) illness before initiation of LL-BFR and (ii) pain in the affected leg related to the LL-BFR-exercise. At follow-up both pain levels and patient-reported outcome measures improved. Isometric hip abduction-, hip extension-, and knee extension strength on both legs and functional performance increased. Conclusion: LL-BFR-exercise seems feasible for treatment of GT. At follow-up, a high adherence and low drop-out rate were observed. Further, patients reported clinically relevant reductions in pain, and showed significant increases in isometric hip and knee strength.","output":"Exercise With Low-Loads and Concurrent Partial Blood Flow Restriction Combined With Patient Education in Females Suffering From Gluteal Tendinopathy: A Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Los coronavirus son una familia de virus que se caracterizan por producir afectaciones respiratorias y gastrointestinales en animales y en seres humanos El actual SARS-CoV-2, agente infeccioso de la COVID-19, pertenece a un subgrupo denominado betacoronavirus del que hacen parte el SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV, virus responsables de epidemias en el 2002 y el 2012, respectivamente Estos virus tambin pueden infectar el sistema nervioso debido a su afinidad con la enzima convertidora de angiotensina humana 2 (ACE2), la cual se expresa en neuronas y clulas gliales Se ha demostrado que las infecciones con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV, y ahora tambin con el SARS-CoV-2, ocasionan condiciones neurolgicas como la enfermedad cerebrovascular aguda, la conciencia alterada y las lesiones musculares, as como mareos, hipogeusia, hiposmia, hipoxia, neuralgia y encefalopata hipxica Por ello debe prestarse mucha atencin a las manifestaciones neurolgicas de los pacientes de COVID-19 Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders in animals and humans The current SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 infectious agent, belongs to a subgroup called betacoronavirus including the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV responsible for epidemics in 2002 and 2012, respectively These viruses can also infect the nervous system due to their affinity for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in neurons and glial cells Infections with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2 also produce neurological signs such as acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness, and muscle injury, as well as dizziness, hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypoxia, neuralgia, and hypoxic encephalopathy For this reason, close attention should be paid to the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients","output":"Effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on the nervous system.

Phylogenetic inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to determine lineages that seeded the local epidemic. Three patients were known to have travelled internationally and an outbreak was detected in a nearby supermarket. Sequencing of 50 samples produced 46 high-quality genomes.

Data of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The characteristics of liver function and its relation with the severity and prognosis of disease were described. RESULTS: Of 105 SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%). The values of the indices mentioned above increased substantially during hospitalization (all P < .05). Fourteen (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. Most of them (10, 71.43%) recovered after 8 (range 6-21) days. Notably, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure.

In this article, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, and research priorities for long-COVID focusing on the respiratory system. RECENT FINDINGS: Breathlessness, cough and chest pain were the most commonly reported respiratory symptoms associated with long-COVID. In hospitalised patients, abnormalities on lung function testing or chest imaging were observed less commonly at 12amonths compared to six months since discharge. Clinical assessment of patients with persisting symptoms after acute COVID-19 requires a comprehensive evaluation to exclude other possible causes for symptoms. With no robust current evidence for interventions to treat long-COVID respiratory symptoms, symptomatic treatment, supported self-management and pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered to help individuals with respiratory symptoms associated with long-COVID. SUMMARY: Long-COVID is a debilitating syndrome that often includes persisting respiratory symptoms and to a lesser degree, abnormalities in lung physiology or imaging. Respiratory features of long-COVID may reduce over time, yet resolution is not seen in all cases.

While Sias may promote binding of, e.g., influenza viruses and SV40, they act as decoys for betacoronaviruses. The presence of two common forms of Sias, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, is species-specific, and in humans, the enzyme converting Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc (CMAH, CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase) is lost, most likely due to adaptation to pathogen regimes; we discuss the research about the influence of malaria on this trait.

External validation of a CNN on a temporally separate (separated by time) or geographically separate (separated by location) dataset is crucial to assess generalizability of the CNN before application to clinical practice in other institutions. We aimed to answer the following questions: are current CNNs for fracture recognition externally valid?; which methods are applied for external validation (EV)?; and, what are reported performances of the EV sets compared to the internal validation (IV) sets of these CNNs? METHODS The PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched from January 2010 to October 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The type of EV, characteristics of the external dataset, and diagnostic performance characteristics on the IV and EV datasets were collected and compared. Quality assessment was conducted using a seven-item checklist based on a modified Methodologic Index for NOn-Randomized Studies instrument (MINORS). RESULTS Out of 1,349 studies, 36 reported development of a CNN for fracture detection and/or classification. Of these, only four (11%) reported a form of EV. One study used temporal EV, one conducted both temporal and geographical EV, and two used geographical EV. When comparing the CNN's performance on the IV set versus the EV set, the following were found: AUCs of 0.967 (IV) versus 0.975 (EV), 0.976 (IV) versus 0.985 to 0.992 (EV), 0.93 to 0.96 (IV) versus 0.80 to 0.89 (EV), and F1-scores of 0.856 to 0.863 (IV) versus 0.757 to 0.840 (EV).

The SVM models were built to predict RP+ patients with a BN signature that was constructed based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model. The evaluation of the prediction models was performed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and accuracy in the test. The performance of the BN+KL-6 model was compared to the performance based on the BN, conventional original pCT, and wavelet decomposition (WD) models. RESULTS: The test AUCs obtained for the BN+KL-6, BN, pCT, and WD models were 0.825, 0.807, 0.642, and 0.545, respectively. The accuracies of the BN+KL-6, BN, pCT, and WD models were found to be 0.724, 0.708, 0.591, and 0.534, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the comprehensive performance of the BN+KL-6 model for the prediction of potential RP+ patients before SABR for lung cancer.","output":"Synergistic combination of a topologically invariant imaging signature and a biomarker for the accurate prediction of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis before stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for lung cancer: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust antibody responses in some patients, with a majority of the response directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein. Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that na?ve antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human na?ve antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/ml in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of na?ve antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.","output":"Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain isolated from a na?ve human antibody library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"a mathematical model depicting the spread of covid-19 epidemic and implementation of population covid-19 intervention in Italy The model has 8 components leading to system of 8 ordinary differential equations In this paper, we investigate the model using the concept of fractional differential operator A numerical method based on the Lagrange polynomial was used to solve the system equations depicting the spread of COVID-19 A detailed investigation of stability including reproductive number using the next generation matrix, and the Lyapunov were presented in detail Numerical simulations are depicted for various fractional orders (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","output":"A novel mathematics model of covid-19 with fractional derivative.

Despite decades of research efforts, the search for novel biomarkers is still urgently needed for the diagnosis of HCC and the improvement of clinical outcomes. Previous studies of HCC clinical biomarkers have usually focused on serum and urine samples (e.g., serum Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). However, cellular membrane proteins in lesion tissues are less used in HCC diagnosis. The abnormal expression of membrane glycoproteins in tumor lesions are considered as potential targets for tumor diagnosis and tumor therapies. Here, a lectin array has been employed to screen and identify abnormal glycopatterns and cellular membrane glycans in HCC lesion tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. We found that there was significantly less expression of Erythrina cristagalli (ECA) lectin binding (Gal?1-3/?1-4) glycans on the cellular membrane of HCC lesion tissues compared with those of adjacent non-tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis further showed that ECA-binding ability on the membrane proteins of HCC tissues progressively decreased in different tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (stage I to stage III) as the malignancy of liver cancer increased. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis showed ECA-binding ability yielding a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 75%, and a combination of ECA and AFP has better clinical diagnostic efficiency, yielding a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85%, than ECA or AFP assay alone. ECA pull-down followed by mass spectrometry further showed that there was significantly less expression of ECA binding membrane catalase (CAT) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide (P4HB) in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues. The abnormally increased expression of total CAT and P4HB and decreased expression of galactosylated membrane CAT and P4HB in HCC cell lines were correlated with an HCC metastasis status. Our findings suggest that abnormal declined ECA-binding galatosylated membrane glycans and two galactosylated-CAT and P4HB glycoproteins in lesion tissues are potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and/or metastasis prediction for HCC.","output":"Abnormal ECA-Binding Membrane Glycans and Galactosylated CAT and P4HB in Lesion Tissues as Potential Biomarkers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide exceptionally many COVID-19 clusters were observed in meat processing plants.

We performed SARS-CoV-2 screening of workers operating in cooled production rooms and intensive environmental sampling during a two-week study period in June 2020. Sampling of air (both stationary and personal), settling dust, ventilation systems, and sewage was performed. Swabs were collected from high-touch surfaces and workers' hands. Screening of workers was done using oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. Samples were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR. Of the 76 (predominantly asymptomatic) workers tested, 27 (35.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive with modest to low viral loads (Ct[]29.7). In total, 6 out of 203 surface swabs were positive (Ct []38), being swabs taken from communal touchscreens/handles. One of the 12 personal air samples and one of the 4 sewage samples were positive, RNA levels were low (Ct[]38). All other environmental samples tested negative.

This method is sensitive but cannot distinguish replicating from non-replicating virus. RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values are inversely correlated with viral load, and higher Ct values have been correlated with lower in vitro viral infectivity. However, relatively few data exist on the association between Ct values and patients duration of symptoms remains unclear. We thus evaluated Ct values and symptom duration in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed all patients admitted to San Francisco General Hospital between April 1 and May 18, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR testing (Abbott m2000 platform). We included patients having diagnostic testing for suspected COVID-19 and patients having asymptomatic testing per hospital policy. For symptomatic patients, date of symptom onset was abstracted from hospital records, and time from symptom onset to test date was calculated. RT-PCR Ct values were manually extracted. Median Ct and IQR were calculated for patients with < 10 days of symptoms, 10 days of symptoms, and asymptomatic disease. Between-group comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Among 61 patients with positive RT-PCR tests, 40 patients reported < 10 days of symptoms at the time of testing, 15 reported 10 days of symptoms, and 6 were asymptomatic. The median Ct value was 14.2 cycles (IQR, 10.2, 18.3) among patients reporting < 10 days of symptoms, 19.7 cycles (IQR, 15.3, 23.9) among patients reporting 10 days of symptoms, and 26.3 (IQR, 25.0, 29.1) among asymptomatic patients.

Further parameters were the reduction in working capacity after vaccination and the influence of the time of day when vaccines were administered. Methods We conducted a survey on COVID-19 vaccinations and eventual reactions among employees of 89 hospitals of the Helios Group. On May 19th, 2021 employees received an invitation by e-mail from the chief medical officer with a link to the survey tool. Participation was voluntary and non-traceable. The survey was closed on June 21st, 2021. Results 8,375 participants reported on 16,727 vaccinations. Reactogenicity was reported in 75% of COVID-19 vaccinations. In 23% the capacity to work was affected. Major risk factors were female gender, younger age and vaccine other than BNT162b2. ChAdOx induced impairing reactogenicity mainly after the prime vaccination (70.5%), while mRNA-1273 led to more pronounced reactions after the second dose (71.7%). Heterologous prime-booster vaccinations with ChAdOx followed by either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were associated with the highest risk for impairment (81.4%). The time of day of the vaccinations showed no influence. Conclusions Young women had the highest chance to experience reactogenicity and to be unable to work after COVID-19 vaccination.

Therefore, based on a variety of machine learning methods, and considering the seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, the study aims to establish a Combinatorial Judgment Classifier (CJC) model to classify the epidemic trend and improve the accuracy of influenza epidemic early warning. METHODS: The characteristic variables were selected using the single-factor statistical method to establish the influencing factor system of an influenza outbreak. On this basis, the CJC model was proposed to provide an early warning for an influenza outbreak. The characteristic variables in the final model included atmospheric pressure, absolute maximum temperature, mean temperature, absolute minimum temperature, mean dew point temperature, the number of positive detections of seasonal influenza viruses, the positive percentage among all respiratory specimens, and the admission rates in public hospitals with a principal diagnosis of influenza. RESULTS: The accuracy of the CJC model for the influenza outbreak trend reached 96.47%, the sensitivity and specificity change rates of this model were lower than those of other models. Hence, the CJC model has a more stable prediction performance. In the present study, the epidemic situation and meteorological data of Hong Kong in recent years were used as the research objects for the construction of the model index system, and a lag correlation was found between the influencing factors and influenza outbreak. However, some potential risk factors, such as geographical nature and human factors, were not incorporated, which ideally affected the prediction performance to some extent.

In addition, 78.3% of the children had histories of contact with adult patients who had been diagnosed with COVID\\\\19, and 27.0% of our patients had coexisting medical conditions. We found that 40.5% of our patients had mild infection, while 32.4% had moderate infection, and 27.1% had developed severe or critical illness. The most common abnormal laboratory findings in our patients were decreased lymphocytes (45.9%) and increased D\\\\dimer values (43.2%), while abnormal radiological findings were detected in 56.7% of the children. In addition, 64.8% of the patients had received azithromycin, 59.4% of the patients had received oseltamivir, and hydroxychloroquine was used in combination with azithromycin in 35.1% of the children. Non\\\\invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 27.0% of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID\\\\ 19 infection is usually mild in childhood, severe clinic can be seen in children with comorbidities or even in children who were previously healthy.","output":"COVID\\\\19 IN Turkey: A tertiary center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Chinese university students are at high risk for depressive symptoms and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have exacerbated the mental health of university students. However, existing studies on depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a wide range of prevalence estimates, making mental health planning for this population difficult. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys that assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Major Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) and English (PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) databases and preprint platforms were searched to identify cross-sectional studies containing data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the pandemic. Two authors independently retrieved the literature, evaluated the eligibility of potential studies, assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of included studies, and extracted data. RoB was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. RESULTS: In total, 1177 records were retrieved, and 84 studies involving 1 292 811 Chinese university students during the pandemic were included. None of the included studies were rated as completely low RoB. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates of included studies was detected (I2 = 99.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI: 23.3-28.9%), which was significantly higher in female than in male students (30.8% v. 28.6%, p < 0.001), in postgraduates than in undergraduates (29.3% v. 22.9%, p < 0.001), in students living inside than in those living outside the COVID-19 epicentre (27.5% v. 22.3%, P < 0.001), in students from universities at the epicentre than in those from universities outside the epicentre (26.2% v. 23.1%, p < 0.001), in students who had close contact with COVID-19 than in those who did not (46.0% v. 25.0%, p < 0.001), and in students who had acquaintances or relatives infected with COVID-19 (39.7% v. 24.0%, p < 0.001) than in those who did not. Five sources of heterogeneity were identified from the subgroup analysis: survey period, % of males among the survey sample, scale of depressive symptoms, cutoff score of the scale and level of RoB. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-fourth of Chinese university students experienced depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health services for this population should include periodic evaluation of depressive symptoms, expanded social support and psychiatric assessment and treatment when necessary. It is also necessary to design depression prevention programmes that target higher-risk cohorts of university students.","output":"Prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past two centuries, several fatal infectious outbreaks have arisen in Iran.

Badges are a validated, online graphical representation of an achievement, which is accomplished by undertaking criteria-based learning activities. Despite the established educational benefits of badges in higher education, limited research has been conducted into employer awareness, acceptance, and use of digital badges in recruitment practices. To address this research gap, a mixed method study combining quantitative and qualitative data collection was conducted before and during the COVID-19 health pandemic. Approximately 700 employers were emailed and invited to complete the initial survey and 73 responded. One of the major survey findings is that 97% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of digital badges. Significantly, however, despite the lack of employer awareness there was no widespread resistance to the concept of badges, but a strong appeal for further clarification of their value, credibility, and security. Analysis of the data reveals stronger partnership working, between the higher education sector and employers, is pivotal to establish effective digital credentialing systems. Recommendations for higher education institutions have emerged from this study, which aim to balance pedagogical digital badge practice with employer needs. Such synergies are crucial to address the changing skills agenda, to prepare students to thrive in physical and virtual work environments. Given the paucity of research in this field, further studies are warranted, to investigate the impact of digital badges on the employer community. ? 2021 Deakin University.

Only a small proportion of patients require neurosurgical intervention, while many guidelines recommend routine admission of all patients. We aim to validate the Hull Salford Cambridge Decision Rule (HSC DR) and the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) criteria to select low-risk patients for discharge from the emergency department. METHOD A cohort from 18 countries of Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15 patients with injuries on CT imaging was identified from the multicentre Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) Study (conducted from 2014 to 2017) for secondary analysis. A composite outcome measure encompassing need for ongoing hospital admission was used, including seizure activity, death, intubation, neurosurgical intervention and neurological deterioration. We assessed the performance of our previously derived prognostic model, the HSC DR and the BIG criteria at predicting deterioration in this validation cohort. RESULTS Among 1047 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 267 (26%) deteriorated. Our prognostic model achieved a C-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.84). The HSC DR achieved a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%) and specificity of only 4.7% (95% CI: 3.3% to 6.5%) for deterioration. Using the BIG criteria for discharge from the ED achieved a higher specificity (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.9% to 16.1%) and lower sensitivity (94.6%, 95% CI: 90.5% to 97%), with 12/105 patients recommended for discharge subsequently deteriorating, compared with 0/34 with the HSC DR. CONCLUSION Our decision rule would have allowed 3.5% of patients to be discharged, none of whom would have deteriorated. Use of the BIG criteria may select patients for discharge who have too high a risk of subsequent deterioration to be used clinically. Further validation and implementation studies are required to support use in clinical practice.","output":"Performance of the Hull Salford Cambridge Decision Rule (HSC DR) for early discharge of patients with findings on CT scan of the brain: a CENTER-TBI validation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nicotiana clevelandii plants were inoculated with cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus RNA synthesized in vitro, after which further passages were made by sap inoculation.

In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese.

This study attempted to do supplementary research to the current situation of loneliness as well as the related risk factors among the elderly in the province in central Chinese during the COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in one of the central Chinese provinces (Henan Province) from December 2020 to March 2021 using a multistage sampling method, and 568 elderly people without cognitive impairment were interviewed. The UCLA Loneliness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-36 were adopted to collect information. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to analyze the factors resulting in severe loneliness among the elderly with seldom or regular participation in physical exercises. RESULTS: During the epidemic in central China, the elderly suffering from loneliness syndrome accounted for 34.2%, of which 15.5% were severely lonely. Risk factors for severe loneliness were quality of life (OR: 7.129), sleep quality (OR: 3.778), seldom exercise (OR: 4.170), poor economic status (OR: 1.769), and negative attitude toward the prospects for the epidemic control (OR: 4.033). By grouping the participants in terms of physical activity, we found that the quality of life (OR:5.778) was a significant risk factor than sleep quality (OR:2.939) in the seldom exercise group, while the only risk factor in the regular exercise group was the quality of life (OR: 5.021). CONCLUSION: There was an increase in the degree of loneliness among the elderly during the epidemic, and physical activity played an active role in relieving the severe loneliness of the elderly. Therefore, for the sake of the elderly, regular participation in physical exercises should be encouraged during the duration of the epidemic.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Study on the Cross-Talk of the COVID-19-Related Degree of Loneliness and the Etiological Factors Among the Elderly in Central China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The literature on the impact of comorbidities on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 in kidney transplant patients is limited We aimed to review the same Methods: We conducted this review as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations PUBMED, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched for studies, available online till May 31, 2020 Studies reporting comorbidities, clinical course, and outcome of each kidney transplant patient with COVID-19 were included Studies on any other organ transplant, recommendations, or review articles were excluded The impact of comorbidities on severity and outcome was assessed The study appraisal was done using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test A univariate and multivariate logistic regression for predictors of severity and outcome, was done P &lt; 0 05 was considered statistically significant The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020190114) Results: We analyzed 19 studies (56 patients) out of the 355 identified The most common comorbidity was hypertension (83 92%) Nearly 30 35% of the patients had severe clinical course The mortality rate was 19 64% Advanced age was statistically significantly associated with severe course (P = 0 0173) and death (P = 0 0005) Men were more likely to have nonsevere course (P &lt; 0 0001) No comorbidity had any impact on the severity or outcome Patients with severe disease had higher odds of dying (P = 0 002) Conclusions: Comorbidities were not found to have any significant impact, hence the contribution of immunosuppression toward the severity of COVID-19 needs to be studied Ours is the first review to assess the impact of comorbidities in kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 but limited by the number of patients","output":"The impact of comorbidities on clinical course and outcome, in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19: A systematic review and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Identification of risk factors for poor prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to enable the risk stratification and modify the patient's management.

We employed a time series decomposition method to predict the monthly PM(2.5) concentrations in urban cities under permanent lockdown in 2020. The premature mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5) was quantified by the risk factor model from the latest epidemiological studies. Under a whole-year lockdown scenario, annual mean PM(2.5) concentrations in cites ranged from 5.4 to 68.0 g m(?3), and the national mean concentration was reduced by 32.2% compared to the 2015C2019 mean. The Global Exposure Mortality Model estimated that 837.3 (95% CI: 699.8C968.4) thousand people in Chinese cities would die prematurely from illnesses attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5).

Citizens need to cope with guidelines on social interaction, work, home isolation, and symptom recognition. Additionally, health care providers and policy makers have to cope with unprecedented and unpredictable pressure on the health care system they need to manage. By providing citizens with an app, they always have access to the latest information and can assess their own health. This data could be used to support policy makers and health care providers to get valuable insights in the regional distribution of infection load and health care consumption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study is to assess people's use of an app to support them with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and monitoring of their own health for a 7-day period. In addition, we aim to assess the usability of this data for health care providers and policy makers by applying it to an interactive map and combining it with hospital data. The secondary outcomes of the study were user's satisfaction with the information provided in the app, perceived usefulness of the app, health care providers they contacted, and the follow-up actions from this contact. METHODS: This observational cohort study was carried out at the nonacademic teaching hospital \\"Elisabeth Twee Steden\\" (ETZ) in Tilburg, Netherlands.

Optimal timing of implementation of these measures however is not known. In Italy, a national lockdown was decided on March 11(th) 2020 and ended 4(th) of May. At that time, cumulative incidence (CI) was different in Italian regions which ranged from <5 cases/100,000 to >11 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In this paper, we aim to evaluate how level of incidence in different regions at the time of implementation of NPMs affected CI and had an impact on the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rates. We used regional daily new COVID-19 diagnosed cases as well number of people hospitalized in ICU and number of deaths for period February 24-May 11 from all the 19 Italian regions and two autonomous provinces. For each region we calculated: temporal daily trend of cumulative cases of Covid-19/100,000 inhabitants, daily trend of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rate at the end of period. We found that the epidemic curves show similar trends for all regions and all tend to flatten between 11C32 days. However, after 2 months, regions with lower CI at lockdown remained at substantially lower CI (<265 cases/100,000), had a peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU which did not exceed 79.4% and a mortality<0.27/1,000. On the other hand, in regions with higher incidence at lockdown, CI reached 382C921 cases/100,000, the peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU and mortality rate reached 270%, and 1.5/1,000, respectively. Our data suggests that level of CI at the moment of lockdown is important to control the subsequent spread of infection so NPMs should be adopted very early during the course of Covid-19 epidemic, in order to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and to reduce related mortality.","output":"Effect of timing of implementation of containment measures on Covid-19 epidemic.

Rhythm control therapy may slow down or even reverse progressive atrial remodeling. Atrial remodeling has long been recognized as an important predictor of clinical outcomes and therapeutic success, but recent advances have highlighted its clinical relevance and revealed the implications of specific anatomical changes such as atrial asymmetry or shape. This has opened the path to computational precision medicine that captures these data in detail and combines them with other factors, to provide patient-specific solutions. The goal of precision medicine lies in improving clinical outcomes, reducing costs, and avoiding unnecessary procedures. In this article, we review the history of atrial remodeling and we summarize the insights from our research on anatomical atrial remodeling and its association with rhythm outcomes after catheter ablation.

This cross-reactivity is sometimes predictable, such as between lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Pichinde virus, where cross-reactive epitopes share six out of eight amino acids. Here, however, we demonstrate more subtle and less predictable cross-reactivity between LCMV and the unrelated vaccinia virus (VV). Epitope-specific T cell receptor usage differed between individual LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice, even though the mice had similar epitope-specific T cell hierarchies. LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV showed variations, albeit in a distinct hierarchy, in proliferative expansions of and down-regulation of IL-7R by T cells specific to different LCMV epitopes. T cell responses to a VV-encoded epitope that is cross-reactive with LCMV fluctuated greatly in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice. Adoptive transfers of splenocytes from individual LCMV-immune donors resulted in nearly identical VV-induced responses in each of several recipients, but responses differed depending on the donor. This indicates that the specificities of T cell responses that are not shared between individuals may influence cross-reactivity with other antigens and play roles in heterologous immunity upon encounter with another pathogen. This variability in cross-reactive T cell expansion that is unique to the individual may underlie variation in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.","output":"Private specificities of CD8 T cell responses control patterns of heterologous immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Rhabdomyolysis can be a symptom of COVID-19, with very few cases described so far.

To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale. Methods: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19;as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C. Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. Results: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. Conclusions: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","output":"Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders are Associated with Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has motivated researchers to contribute in the area of medical imaging using artificial intelligence and deep learning. Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the non-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a customized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned transformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef convolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution simplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the quality of Covid based medical images. It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality that helps in clinical diagnosis. Experimental results obtained using the proposed Tchebichef transform domain super-resolution (TTDSR) architecture provides competitive results when compared with most of the deep learning methods employed using a fewer number of trainable parameters.","output":"Tchebichef Transform Domain-based Deep Learning Architecture for Image Super-resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in an increase in antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Although not all bacterial contact results in infection, patients can become asymptomatically colonized, increasing the risk of infection and pathogen transmission. Consequently, many institutions have begun active surveillance, but in non-research settings, the resulting data are often incomplete and may include non-random testing, making conventional epidemiological analysis problematic. We describe a mathematical model and inference method for in-hospital bacterial colonization and transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that is tailored for analysis of active surveillance data with incomplete observations. The model and inference method make use of the full detailed state of the hospital unit, which takes into account the colonization status of each individual in the unit and not only the number of colonized patients at any given time. The inference method computes the exact likelihood of all possible histories consistent with partial observations (despite the exponential increase in possible states that can make likelihood calculation intractable for large hospital units), includes techniques to improve computational efficiency, is tested by computer simulation, and is applied to active surveillance data from a 13-bed rehabilitation unit in New York City. The inference method for exact likelihood calculation is applicable to other Markov models incorporating incomplete observations. The parameters that we identify are the patientCpatient transmission rate, pre-existing colonization probability, and prior-to-new-patient transmission probability. Besides identifying the parameters, we predict the effects on the total prevalence (0.07 of the total colonized patient-days) of changing the parameters and estimate the increase in total prevalence attributable to patientCpatient transmission (0.02) above the baseline pre-existing colonization (0.05). Simulations with a colonized versus uncolonized long-stay patient had 44% higher total prevalence, suggesting that the long-stay patient may have been a reservoir of transmission.

Data was collected using a standardized and validated Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire version 2002. We included 408 participants in the analysis. Results The majority of the respondents (66.7%) were females. The mean age of participants was 34 (SD: 9) years. Most of the participants who reported contact dermatitis were nurses (58.6%). Direct patient care roles represent 78% of participants. Respondents who work 40-50 hours per week represent 61.5% of the sample. The most commonly recorded symptoms were dryness (92.9%), itchiness (50%), and redness (46.4%) of the skin. The most affected site was hand 93.5%. Hand cleanser was the commonest substance implicated in the worsening of the skin changes (59.2%). Protective glove material that worsens contact dermatitis, such as natural rubber/latex, represents 76% of responses.

METHODS Medical records were reviewed for all patients at our center transitioning from fingolimod to rituximab or ocrelizumab between 2010 and October 2020. Time periods reviewed were the following: before fingolimod discontinuation, interval between fingolimod and anti-CD20 treatments, and after the first anti-CD20 infusion. The primary outcome was clinical relapses; MRI activity, time to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery, and infections were secondary. Clinical and demographic factors significant in univariable analyses were included in multivariable analyses. RESULTS Transition data were available for 108 patients (68.5% women, 68.5% relapsing-remitting MS, mean age 44.6 years). The median (interquartile range) interval between fingolimod and anti-CD20 therapy was 28 (1-115.2) days.

We have observed that in the settings where the relative index such as concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) or intraclass correlation coefficient is employed, the limits of agreement approach may be inconsistent with the scaled index. Particularly, the broad width of the limits of agreement may indicate a lack of agreement when the two measurements are highly concordant but an acceptable difference is not known and the common variance of the data is large. This research aims to create a novel, CCC-based guidance for graphical evaluation of reproducibility or reliability.

Simulation studies and real examples, including the peak expiratory flow rate data in Bland and Altman's paper and the test-retest reproducibility data of the Radiomics study, are implemented to assess the use of the reference band. RESULTS: In the absence of an acceptable difference between measurements, we found that the limits of agreement may not be consistent with the concordance correlation coefficient.

PS receptors typically bind to apoptotic cell membrane PS and orchestrate the uptake and clearance of apoptotic debris. Many enveloped viruses also contain exposed PS and can therefore exploit these receptors for cell entry. Viral infection can induce PS externalization in host cells, resulting in increased outer PS levels on budding virions. Scramblase enzymes carry out cellular PS externalization, thus, we targeted these proteins in order to manipulate viral envelope PS levels. We investigated two scramblases previously identified to be involved in EBOV PS levels, transmembrane protein 16F and Xk-related protein 8 (XKR8), as possible mediators of cellular and viral envelope surface PS levels during the replication of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus containing its native glycoprotein (rVSV/G) or the EBOV glycoprotein (rVSV/EBOV-GP). We found that rVSV/G and rVSV/EBOV-GP virions produced in XKR8 knockout cells contain decreased levels of PS on their surfaces, and the PS-deficient rVSV/EBOV-GP virions are 70% less efficient at infecting cells through PS receptors. We also observed reduced rVSV and EBOV virus-like particle (VLP) budding in XKR8 cells. Deleting XKR8 in HAP1 cells reduced rVSV/G and rVSV/EBOV-GP budding by 60% and 65% respectively, and reduced Ebola VLP budding more than 60%. We further demonstrated that caspase cleavage of XKR8 is required to promote budding. This suggests that XKR8, in addition to mediating virion PS levels, may also be critical for enveloped virus budding at the plasma membrane. Importance Within the last decade, countries in western and central Africa have experienced the most widespread and deadly Ebola outbreaks since the virus was identified in 1976. While outbreaks are primarily attributed to zoonotic transfer events, new evidence is emerging that outbreaks may be caused by a combination of spillover events and viral latency or persistence in survivors. The possibility that Ebola can remain dormant then re-emerge in survivors highlights the critical need to prevent the virus from entering and establishing infection in human cells. Thus far, host-cell scramblases TMEM16F and XKR8 have been implicated in Ebola envelope surface phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell entry using PS receptors. We assessed the contributions of these proteins using CRISPR knockout cells and two EBOV models: rVSV/EBOV-GP and EBOV VLPs. We observed that XKR8 is required for optimal EBOV envelope PS levels and infectivity, and particle budding across all viral models.","output":"Ebola virus requires phosphatidylserine scrambling activity for efficient budding and optimal infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory tract but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported. Up to one-third of patients admitted to the intensive care unit may develop an acute myocardial injury, characterized by cardiac troponin elevation. However, the pathology underlying COVID-19-associated myocardial injury has rarely been reported. CASE SUMMARY: Three days after being diagnosed for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, a 52-year-old woman without a notable past medical history developed cardiogenic shock with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 25%. Coronary angiography was normal. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated coronary endotheliitis with multiple microvascular thromboses but no lymphocytic infiltrate and a negative polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was implanted with a short-term LV assist device (Impella CP(?), Abiomed, Aachen, Germany) and treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. She suffered from concomitant respiratory failure that required 14 days of orotracheal intubation, 10 days of dexamethasone, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Clinical outcome was favourable with weaning of the Impella device after 6 days and full recovery of LVEF (65%) at 30 days. Cardiac magnetic resonance performed at Day 30 showed no evidence of myocarditis or scars and confirmed the normalization of LVEF. DISCUSSION: This case highlights how COVID-19-associated coronary endotheliitis and thrombotic microangiopathy, in the absence of myocarditis, may induce transient severe LV dysfunction and cardiogenic shock.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019-associated coronary endotheliitis and thrombotic microangiopathy causing cardiogenic shock: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whereas most countries in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic imposed shutdowns and curfews to mitigate the contagion, Sweden uniquely pursued a more voluntarist approach. In this article, our interest is primarily on how and why Sweden's approach to the pandemic was so unique. There are two parts to this research question: (1) why did virtually all other nations follow a radical lockdown protocol despite limited evidence to its effectiveness and (2) why did Sweden not follow this same protocol despite strong political pressures? The answers to these questions lie within typical government technocracy versus Sweden's constitutional separation of government and technocracy. We review the history of the responses to the pandemic and show how the tyranny of experts was severe within the typical technocratic policy response, and attenuated in Sweden's. Thus, the recent pandemic offers empirical evidence and insights regarding the role of Hayekian knowledge problems in engendering a technocratic tyranny of experts and how such effects can be structurally mitigated.","output":"Separation of power and expertise: Evidence of the tyranny of experts in Sweden's COVID\\\\19 responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the drylands of Africa, pastoralists have been facing new challenges, including those related to environmental shocks and stresses. In northern Kenya, under conditions of reduced rainfall and more frequent droughts, one response has been for pastoralists to focus increasingly on camel herding. Camels have started to be kept at higher altitudes and by people who rarely kept camels before. The development has been understood as a climate change adaptation strategy and as a means to improve climate resilience. Since 2003, development organizations have started to further the trend by distributing camels in the region. Up to now, little has been known about the nature of, reasons for, or ramifications of the increased reliance on camels. The paper addresses these questions and concludes that camels improve resilience in this dryland region, but only under certain climate change scenarios, and only for some groups.","output":"Camels and Climate Resilience: Adaptation in Northern Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theatre has been associated with contagion and contagious emotions since Plato and Aristotle. In the twentieth century, Antonin Artaud proposed that theatre or performance should be like the plague that takes control of actors' and spectators' bodies and infects them with an affective energy. For these infections to happen, however, audiences and actors must be in the same room. In times of the corona pandemic, this spatial proximity has been substituted by theatre mostly performed and/or streamed online. This article offers some preliminary thoughts on this development: it considers what we descriptively call \\"viral theatre.\\" We argue that we currently witness a form of viral theatre that manifests itself through an interplay of three aspects: first, the fact that both performers and spectators are in a state of disruption, second, the willingness/expectations on the part of spectators to participate in the event, and, finally, the use of communication technologies such as Zoom. The framework of the pandemic, therefore, enhances and modifies what viral theatre can be and what kind of effect it can have, oscillating between more Platonic notions of dangerous contagion when plays force us to explore questions of complicity and the Aristotelian ideal of cathartic emotions when plays/performers reach out to us for moral support.","output":"Viral Theatre: Preliminary Thoughts on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Online Theatre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapidly-emerging variants jeopardize antibody-based countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 While recent cell culture experiments have demonstrated loss of potency of several anti-spike neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains1-3, the in vivo significance of these results remains uncertain Here, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to many in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Regeneron, and Lilly we report the impact on protection in animals against authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including WA1/2020 strains, a B 1 1 7 isolate, and chimeric strains with South African (B 1 351) or Brazilian (B 1 1 28) spike genes Although some individual mAbs showed reduced or abrogated neutralizing activity against B 1 351 and B 1 1 28 viruses with E484K spike protein mutations in cell culture, low prophylactic doses of mAb combinations protected against infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, 129S2 immunocompetent mice, and hamsters without emergence of resistance Two exceptions were mAb LY-CoV555 monotherapy which lost all protective activity in vivo, and AbbVie 2B04/47D11, which showed partial loss of activity When administered after infection as therapy, higher doses of mAb cocktails protected in vivo against viruses displaying a B 1 351 spike gene Thus, many, but not all, of the antibody products with Emergency Use Authorization should retain substantial efficacy against the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variant strains","output":"In vivo monoclonal antibody efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) is a recently identified psychological disorder, characterized by excessively and addictively engaging in vivid, narrative, intensely emotional fantasy activity, at times with the aid of music and/or repetitive movements, causing distress and functional impairment. Over 100,000 self-diagnosed individuals are active online and thousands of them have been researched; yet there are no studies using clinical interviews on large, systematic general (non-MD) samples, to assess the estimated prevalence of this suggested disorder, and establish norms for its main psychometric tool. METHODS: Four independent Israeli samples (three student samples, and one sample representing the general Jewish-Israeli population; total N = 1,023) self-reported MD. In two samples, those exceeding the cutoff score for suspected MD were invited for a structured clinical interview. RESULTS: The skewness of most items of the 16-item Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale (MDS-16) supports the notion of MD as a binary construct rather than a normally distributed trait. In the community sample, 4.2% exceeded the cutoff for suspected MD. Rates were higher when focusing on the young adult age group or student samples (5.5C8.5%), suggesting a likely age effect. Following clinical interviews, only 60% of interviewed respondents met criteria for diagnosis, suggesting a true point-prevalence of 2.5% in the Israeli-Jewish population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic clinical evaluation of the prevalence of MD. In an Israeli sample, a point-prevalence of 2.5% was found, like several other internalizing psychiatric syndromes. This result, along with the Non-normal nature of item distribution, both support the validity of MD as a psychological disorder, which should be considered as a potential addition to future psychiatric diagnostic manuals.","output":"Maladaptive Daydreaming: Epidemiological Data on a Newly Identified Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor air particulate matter (PM) in urban areas of northern Italy and USA. The city of Madrid was heavily affected by COVID-19 during March-June 2020. Also, this city usually displays high concentrations of PM under several atmospheric situations. This is mandatory to assess the presence of viral RNA in PM, as an indicator of epidemic recurrence. Our study was aimed at investigating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in outdoor air samples (on PM10, PM2.5 and PM1). METHODS: Six samples of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were collected between the May 4th and 22nd 2020 in Madrid, on quartz fiber filters by using MCV high volume samplers (30 m3 h-1 flow) with three inlets (Digitel DHA-80) for sampling PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. RNA extraction and amplification was performed according to the protocol recently set by Setti et al.2020c in Italy. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (N1, N2, and RP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: After RNA extraction and expression measurements of N1, N2 and RP genes from all the collected filters, no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. Control tests to exclude false positive results were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSIONS: No presence of SARS-CoV-2 in quartz fiber filters samplers for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 fractions was observed in our study carried out in Madrid during the month of May 2020. Nevertheless, the absence of viral genomes could be due to different factors including: limited social interactions and economic activities resulting in reduced circulation of the coronavirus, lower daily PM concentration in outdoor air, as well as to meteorological stability and higher temperature that characterize spring season. Further research should be carried out during winter, in presence of higher viral circulation and daily PM exceedances.","output":"Determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different particulate matter size fractions of outdoor air samples in Madrid during the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Although common mental disorders (CMDs) highly impact individuals and society, a knowledge gap exists on how sickness absence can be prevented in workers with CMDs. This study explores: (1) workers' perceived causes of sickness absence; (2) perceived return to work (RTW) barriers and facilitators; and (3) differences between workers with short, medium and long-term sickness absence. Methods A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted involving 34 workers with CMDs. Semi-structured interviews were held at two time-points during their RTW process. The 68 interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and thematically analyzed to explore workers' perspective on sickness absence causes, RTW barriers and facilitators, and compare data across the three sub-groups of workers. Results Workers reported various causes for their absence, including: (1) high work pressure; (2) poor work relationships; (3) unhelpful thoughts and feelings, e.g. lacking self-insight; and (4) ineffective coping behaviors. According to workers, RTW was facilitated by work adjustments, fulfilling relationships with supervisors, and adequate occupational health guidance. Workers with short-term leave more often reported favorable work conditions, and proactive coping behavior. In contrast, the long-term group reported reactive coping behavior and dissatisfaction with their work. Conclusion Supporting workers with CMDs in gaining self-awareness and regaining control, discussing the value of their work, and creating work conditions that enable workers to do valuable work, seem central for successful RTW and might prevent sickness absence. Supervisors play a key role in enabling workers to do valuable work and further research should focus on how supervisors can be supported in this task.","output":"Barriers and Facilitators for Return to Work from the Perspective of Workers with Common Mental Disorders with Short, Medium and Long-Term Sickness Absence: A Longitudinal Qualitative Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain tumor localization and segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are hard and important tasks for several applications in the field of medical analysis. As each brain imaging modality gives unique and key details related to each part of the tumor, many recent approaches used four modalities T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR. Although many of them obtained a promising segmentation result on the BRATS 2018 dataset, they suffer from a complex structure that needs more time to train and test. So, in this paper, to obtain a flexible and effective brain tumor segmentation system, first, we propose a preprocessing approach to work only on a small part of the image rather than the whole part of the image. This method leads to a decrease in computing time and overcomes the overfitting problems in a Cascade Deep Learning model. In the second step, as we are dealing with a smaller part of brain images in each slice, a simple and efficient Cascade Convolutional Neural Network (C-ConvNet/C-CNN) is proposed. This C-CNN model mines both local and global features in two different routes. Also, to improve the brain tumor segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art models, a novel Distance-Wise Attention (DWA) mechanism is introduced. The DWA mechanism considers the effect of the center location of the tumor and the brain inside the model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BRATS 2018 dataset and show that the proposed model obtains competitive results: the proposed method achieves a mean whole tumor, enhancing tumor, and tumor core dice scores of 0.9203, 0.9113 and 0.8726 respectively.

For the EU bloc to be prosilient, it needs to have the right early warning indicators to allow short-term healthcare system preparedness and agile planning of the public health response. METHOD: The association of COVID-19 disease burden, as measured by mortality (COVID-19 and all-cause), hospital and ICU occupancy, with incidence rate (IR), total positivity rate (TPR) and adjusted TPR as proposed by Vong and Kakkar, was investigated using Poisson regression analysis. This was carried out using both real-time data and time lags of up to 8 weeks to identify potential for early warning of spikes in disease burden. ECDC weekly figures for these indicators were used, and the analysis was repeated for the subset of data after Week 42 of 2020, when the EU Council introduced minimum COVID-19 testing rates. RESULTS: TPR and IR were noted to be the most predictive of COVID-19 disease burden whilst adjusted TPR applied on weekly data was not associated. TPR behaved better at predicting all-cause mortality in both analyses. The TPR and IR were both best associated with hospital and ICU occupancy and COVID-19 mortality with a short time lag (2C3 weeks in the case of TPR with hospital occupancy and COVID-19 mortality). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring TPR can provide a 2C3-week warning of a spike in hospital occupancy and COVID-19 mortality.

We dubbed those solutions as the compensated/uncompensated strings. The compensated string is similar to the conventional cosmic string in the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) string, around which only the would-be Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson winds. Around the uncompensated string, on the other hand, the physical NG boson also winds, where the physical NG boson is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the enhanced symmetry. Our previous simulation in the 2+1 dimensional spacetime confirmed that both the compensated/uncompensated strings are formed at the phase transition of the symmetry breaking. Non-trivial winding of the physical NG boson around the strings potentially causes the so-called axion domain-wall problem when the model is applied to the axion model. In this paper, we perform simulation in the 3+1 dimensional spacetime to discuss the fate of the uncompensated strings. We observe that the evolution of the string-network is highly complicated in the 3+1 dimensional simulation compared with that seen in the previous simulation. Despite such complications, we find that the number of the uncompensated strings which could cause can be highly suppressed at late times.

The study aim was to retrospectively assess the safety and efficacy of Onyx embolization with the intention to cure AVMs in a pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients (<18 years) who underwent endovascular embolization using Onyx at our institution was conducted. The primary endpoint was the composite complete angiographic occlusion of AVM immediately after the last embolization session that had no procedure-related complication requiring emergency surgery. Secondary endpoints were angiographic occlusion rates, procedure-related complications, and clinical outcomes after treatment and at the 6-month follow-up RESULTS Twenty-three patients (mean age, 11.7 years) underwent a total of 45 embolization sessions. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was 3 (range 1 to 4). The primary endpoint was achieved in 19 patients (82.6 %). Complete angiographic occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 21 patients (91.3 %) immediately after embolization and at the 6-month follow-up. Embolization-related complications were observed in three patients (13 %). None of the complications resulted in permanent functional disability or death. In two patients (8.7 %), the AVM could not be completely occluded by embolization alone and the patients were referred to radiosurgery and microsurgery, respectively.

The reliability of N95 respirators in preventing transmission depends on their fit to the wearer. Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) is the gold standard used to determine this fit objectively. The manufacturers of the respirators also recommend performing a self-reported user-seal-check to detect for leakage. This study aims to investigate the capability of the user-seal-check in determining the fit of N95 respirators by investigating the sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check compared with QNFT. A prospective and cross-sectional research design was used. A total of 204 local Chinese undergraduate nursing students were recruited to test two commonly used respirator models (3M 1860S and 3M 1862). The results of the user-seal-check were compared with the results of the gold standard QNFT using the Condensation Nucleus Counter Fit Tester System. The sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check results obtained with the respirators were calculated.

Objectives: The current study addressed the multi-dimensional impact of COVID-19 upon healthcare professionals, particularly spine surgeons, worldwide. Secondly, it aimed to identify geographical variations and similarities. Methods: A multi-dimensional survey was distributed to surgeons worldwide. Questions were categorized into domains: demographics, COVID-19 observations, preparedness, personal impact, patient care, and future perceptions. Results: 902 spine surgeons representing 7 global regions completed the survey. 36.8% reported co-morbidities. Of those that underwent viral testing, 15.8% tested positive for COVID-19, and testing likelihood was region-dependent; however, 7.2% would not disclose their infection to their patients. Family health concerns were greatest stressor globally (76.0%), with anxiety levels moderately high. Loss of income, clinical practice and current surgical management were region-dependent, whereby 50.4% indicated personal-protective-equipment were not adequate. 82.3% envisioned a change in their clinical practice as a result of COVID-19. More than 33% of clinical practice was via telemedicine. Research output and teaching/training impact was similar globally. 96.9% were interested in online medical education. 94.7% expressed a need for formal, international guidelines to manage COVID-19 patients.

Despite its infrequent presentation, there is significant associated morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is playing an increasingly prominent role in trauma presentations. The aim of this article was to compare outcomes of TAE with more traditional management methods for the treatment of massive facial haemorrhage following maxillofacial trauma. METHODS A database and Google Scholar search was performed, with articles discussing massive facial haemorrhage secondary to maxillofacial trauma and its management included. RESULTS Twenty-seven articles were found that met inclusion criteria, encompassing 384 patients. Statistical testing comparing mortality between TAE and non-TAE groups did not find a significant difference, with a mortality rate of 30.2% in the TAE group and 38.9% in the non-TAE group. Assessment of morbidity directly related to interventions was difficult, as many of the included participants had significant associated injuries which contributed an indeterminate degree to morbidity. There was a 10% rate of adverse events associated with TAE, most commonly puncture site haematomas and soft tissue swelling, with more significant adverse events including cerebrovascular accidents and blindness. CONCLUSION Embolization was correlated with increased rates of haemorrhage control when compared with other interventions. Overall, despite no significant impact on mortality, embolization is recommended in the management of massive haemorrhage following maxillofacial trauma due to improved success rates at haemorrhage control and a low rate of significant adverse events.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of arterial embolization compared with traditional management on outcomes of traumatic massive facial haemorrhage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing evidence that racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden from COVID-19. Temporal changes in the pandemic epidemiology and diversity in the clinical course require careful study to identify determinants of poor outcomes. We analyzed 6255 hospitalized individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from one of 5 hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 2020 and March 2021, using electronic health records to assess risk factors and outcomes through 8 weeks post-admission. Discharge, readmission and mortality outcomes were analyzed in a multi-state model with multivariable Cox models for each transition. Mortality varied markedly over time, with cumulative incidence (95% CI) 30 days post-admission of 19.1% (16.9, 21.3) in March-April 2020, 5.7% (4.2, 7.5) in July-October 2020 and 10.5% (9.1,12.0) in January-March 2021; 26% of deaths occurred after discharge. Average age (SD) at admission varied from 62.7 (17.6) to 54.8 (19.9) to 60.5 (18.1); mechanical ventilation use declined from 21.3% to 9C11%. Compared to Caucasian, Black race was associated with more severe disease at admission, higher rates of co-morbidities and residing in a low-income zip code. Between-race risk differences in mortality risk diminished in multivariable models; while admitting hospital, increasing age, admission early in the pandemic, and severe disease and low blood pressure at admission were associated with increased mortality hazard. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with fewer baseline co-morbidities and lower mortality hazard (0.57, 95% CI: 0.37, .087). Multi-state modeling allows for a unified framework to analyze multiple outcomes throughout the disease course. Morbidity and mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied over time but post-discharge mortality remained non-trivial. Black race was associated with more risk factors for morbidity and with treatment at hospitals with lower mortality. Multivariable models suggest there are not between-race differences in outcomes. Future work is needed to better understand the identified between-hospital differences in mortality.","output":"Determinants of hospital outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in the University of Pennsylvania Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biodiversity is threatened by the growth of urban areas.

We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds' daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities.

This survey study sought to identify practice changes, understand current personal protection equipment (PPE) use, and determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers versus low case numbers. METHODS: A fourteen-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country via REDCap from 4/14/2020 to 4/21/2020 with responses closed on 4/23/2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). RESULTS: A total of 121 vascular surgeon responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between high case and low COVID case states (p=0.285). High case states were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs. 77.5%, p=0.046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attendings work with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attendings have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service, and/or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in high case volume states compared to low case volume states (p=0.039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons feel that they do not have adequate PPE to perform clinical their duties. CONCLUSION: The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty, however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey.","output":"Early Vascular Surgery Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Nationwide Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Afin dtablir les populations  risque de forme svre de COVID-19, les pidmies de grippe ont t initialement considres comme un modle appropri.

Here, we developed a network-based algorithm, LncTx, to repurpose the medications that potentially act on survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer. We used eight survival-related lncRNAs derived from our previous study to test the efficacy of this method. LncTx calculates the shortest path length (proximity) between the drug targets and the lncRNA-correlated proteins in the proteinCprotein interaction network (interactome). LncTx contains seven different proximity measures, which are calculated in the unweighted or weighted interactome. First, to test the performance of LncTx in predicting correct indication of drugs, we benchmarked the proximity measures based on the accuracy of differentiating anticancer drugs from non-anticancer drugs. The closest proximity weighted by clustering coefficient (closestCC) has the best performance (AUC around 0.8) compared to other proximity measures across all survival-related lncRNAs. The majority of the other six proximity measures have decent performance as well, with AUC greater than 0.7. Second, to evaluate whether LncTx can repurpose the drugs effectively acting on the lncRNAs, we clustered the drugs according to their proximities by hierarchical clustering. The drugs with smaller proximity (proximal drugs) were proved to be more effective than the drugs with larger proximity (distal drugs). In conclusion, LncTx enables us to accurately identify anticancer drugs and can potentially be an index to repurpose effective agents acting on survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer.","output":"LncTx: A network-based method to repurpose drugs acting on the survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invited commentary on Letter: Napoletano S, Basile G, Lo Faro AF, Negro F.

Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) is rapidly emerging as a necessary sub-specialty, and this study aims to provide the epidemiological context over the past decade supporting this need by detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter and setting the stage for the development of training programs utilizing these data. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in the US from 2008-2018. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD. Ambiguous events were excluded when there was uncertainty as to whether the incident met all of the criteria for inclusion in the GTD. The grey literature was reviewed, and each event was cross-matched with reputable international and national newspaper sources online to confirm or add details regarding weapon type used and, whenever available, details of victim and perpetrator fatalities and injuries. RESULTS In total, 304 events were recorded during the period of study. Of the 304 events, 117 (38.5%) used incendiary-only weapons, 80 (26.3%) used firearms as their sole weapon, 55 (18.1%) used explosives, bombs, or dynamite (E/B/D), 23 (7.6%) were melee-only, six (2.0%) used vehicles-only, four (1.3%) were chemicals-only, two (0.7%) used sabotage equipment, two (0.7%) were listed as \\"others,\\" and one (0.3%) used biological weapon.

Radial nerve paralysis, triceps myopathy, and fractures of the humerus and ulna were ruled out. The caudal aspect of the affected antebrachium of each horse was very firm to palpation and became firmer when weight was shifted onto the limb.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in daily clinical practice using a nationwide Dutch cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced CaP. BASIC PROCEDURES Patients were invited to complete the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment (baseline) and at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. We calculated the mean EPIC-26 domain scores, stratified by treatment modality (i.e., radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and no active treatment), and the proportions of patients with UI (defined as  2 pads per day) and ED (defined as erections not firm enough for sexual intercourse). Logistic regression modeling was used to explore the factors related to UI and ED after surgery. MAIN FINDINGS In total 1,759 patients participated in this study. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy experienced clinically relevant worsening in the urinary incontinence domain. After excluding patients who reported UI at baseline, 15% of patients with prostatectomy reported UI 24 months after diagnosis. Only comorbidity was associated with UI in surgically treated patients. Regardless of treatment, patients reported a clinically significant reduced sexual functioning over time. Before treatment, 54% of patients reported ED. Among the 46% remaining patients, 87% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy reported ED 24 months after diagnosis, 41% after radiotherapy, and 46% in patients without active treatment. Bilateral nerve-sparing surgery was the only factor associated with ED after 24 months. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS UI and ED frequently occur in patients with localized and locally advanced CaP, in particular after radical prostatectomy. The higher occurrence rate of UI and ED, compared with clinical trial participants, supports the importance of real-world data, which can be used for local treatment recommendations and patient information, but also to evaluate effects of future initiatives, such as treatment centralization and research aimed at improving functional outcomes.","output":"Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer: A nationwide observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Control of posttranscriptional mRNA decay is a crucial determinant of cell homeostasis and differentiation. mRNA lifetime is governed by cis-regulatory elements in their 3 untranslated regions (UTR).

Structural analyses are complicated by inconsistent mapping and prediction of RNA fold, by dynamics, and size. We here, for the first time, provide the secondary structure of a complete mRNA 3UTR. We use NMR spectroscopy in a divide-and-conquer strategy complemented with SAXS, In-line probing and SHAPE-seq applied to the 3UTR of Ox40 mRNA, which encodes a T-cell co-receptor repressed by the protein Roquin. We provide contributions of RNA elements to Roquin-binding. The protein uses its extended bi-modal ROQ domain to sequentially engage in a 2:1 stoichiometry with a 3UTR core motif.

Revealing the activation mechanism of NF-B signaling is important for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In this study, the regulation of TNF/NF-B signaling by VRK2 (vaccinia-related kinase 2) was investigated. The levels of VRK2 protein were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The functions of VRK2 in the progression of pancreatic cancer were examined using CCK8 assay, anchorage-independent assay, EdU assay and tumorigenesis assay. The regulation of VRK2 on the NF-B signaling was investigated by immunoprecipitation and invitro kinase assay. It was discovered in this study that the expression of VRK2 was upregulated in pancreatic cancer and that the VRK2 expression level was significantly correlated with the pathological characteristics and the survival time of patients. VRK2 promoted the growth, sphere formation and subcutaneous tumorigenesis of pancreatic carcinoma cells as well as the organoid growth derived from the pancreatic cancer mouse model. Investigation of the molecular mechanism indicated that VRK2 interacts with IKK?, phosphorylating its Ser177 and Ser181 residues and thus activating the TNF/NF-B signaling pathway. An IKK? inhibitors abolished the promotive effect of VRK2 on the growth of organoids. The findings of this study indicate that VRK2 promotes the progression of pancreatic cancer by activating the TNF/NF-B signaling pathway, suggesting that VRK2 is a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.","output":"VRK2 activates TNF/NF-B signaling by phosphorylating IKK? in pancreatic cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to assess the various psychological effects of the Coronavirus on those in isolation, the factors that cause these effects during the pandemic, as well as to discuss the recommendations and strategies that can be implemented to help reduce the negative psychological impact.

They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We conducted a telephone survey (MayCJune 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. Findings Mass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice.

Having a large amount of data such as the one presented in a scopeless Wikidata offers some advantages, e.g., unique access point and common format, but also poses some challenges, e.g., performance.Regular wikidata users are not unfamiliar with running into frequent timeouts of submitted queries.

Replicating Wikidata on one's own infrastructure can be a solution which also offers a snapshot of the contents of wikidata at some given point in time. There is no need to replicate Wikidata in full, it is possible to work with subsets targeting, for instance, a particular domain.

A critical consideration for receiving communities is the provision of adequate and affordable housing for new residents, many of whom have been driven to relocate due to housing insecurity caused by climate change impacts. Climate change can contribute to housing insecurity in multiple ways, such as when insurance rates increase for low-income homeowners living in flood-prone areas, or when disasters destroy existing affordable housing stock.

Cognitive dysfunction is common following major surgery and may relate to intra-operative cerebral hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate whether internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow increases when MAP is kept higher than 60 mmHg using noradrenaline. DESIGN A randomised, cross-over trial. SETTING Department of Anaesthesia, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, from December 2017 to April 2018. PATIENTS Patients with median [IQR] age 71 [63 to 75] years underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 19), total pancreatic resection (n = 1) or gastro-entero anastomosis (n = 2) during combined propofol-remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia. INTERVENTION MAP was maintained between 60 to 65, 70 to 75 and 80 to 85 mmHg, in a random order, by noradrenaline infusion at a stable level of anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 80 to 85 mmHg. Secondary outcomes were change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 70 to 75 and 70 to 75 vs. 80 to 85 mmHg. Duplex ultrasound evaluated ICA flow. RESULTS A (mean  SD) increase in MAP from 62  1 to 82  1 mmHg elevated ICA flow from 196  53 to 226  61 ml min (mean difference 31 ml min; 95% CI 19 to 42; P < 0.0001). An increase in MAP from 62  1 to 72  1 mmHg elevated ICA flow to 210  52 ml min (P = 0.0271) and ICA flow increased further (P = 0.0165) when MAP was elevated to 82  1 mmHg. CONCLUSION During combined propofol-remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia, ICA flow increased by approximately 15% when the MAP was elevated from about 60 to 80 mmHg.

The focus of this article is on discrimination and bias in their workplaces as reported by the lawyers experiencing it. METHODS We employ survey data from the first phase of this investigation, gathered from the survey responses of 3590 lawyers located across all states in the United States and working in most types and sizes of legal venues. The data were collected between 2018 and 2019, before the 2020 pandemic. We estimate differences across three categories of discrimination reported-subtle-only discrimination, overt-only discrimination, and both subtle and overt discrimination. We estimate the nature and magnitude of associations among individual and organizational variables, and we use multinomial logistic regression to illustrate relative risks of reports of discrimination for intersecting identities. RESULTS As compared to non-disabled lawyers, lawyers with disabilities show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overt discrimination versus no discrimination. Similarly, lawyers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (\\"LGBQ\\") show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overtdiscrimination, and subtle-only discrimination, as compared to lawyers who identify as straight/heterosexual. Women lawyers and lawyers of color are more likely to report all three types of discrimination. In general, younger lawyers are more likely to report subtle-only discrimination when compared to older lawyers. Lawyers working at a private firm are less likely to report all types of discrimination, while working for a larger organization is associated with a higher relative risk of reporting subtle-only discrimination versus no discrimination. CONCLUSIONS The current study represents a next, incremental step for better understanding non-monochromatic and intersectional aspects of individual identity in the legal profession.

In Hong Kong (HK), nine new towns have been built in New Territories since 1970s, providing 172.6 km2 built-up land and large amount of residences for 3.4 million people. However, due to land scarcity, development restriction, and social opposition, New Development Area (NDA), as the small-scale extension of New Town (NT), was designated as one of the main approaches for HK medium and long term land supply. To demonstrate the characteristics of urban fringe land use transitions in Hong Kong, literature review and case study were used in this research. The history of new town development and the scheme of new development areas were introduced firstly. Afterwards, the land use features of NT and NDA were compared and the case of Hung Shui Kiu NDA was illustrated. It is concluded that while housing, infrastructure and facility were the main elements in NTs, employment, vibrancy and environment were suggested to be the new compulsory elements in NDAs integrated to the traditional planning concepts. As for the development approach, lease modification was adopted in NDA to allow private landowners directly develop their land, in addition to the traditional development approach of land resumption in NT. It is suggested to ensure the development of NDA, the proposed development plan should be persuasive to provide the optimal land use distribution as a trade-off among the profits of developers, the interests of local villager, government concern and the provision of land for future residents.

While continuous opinion evolution independent of discrete choice behavior has been extensively studied, few works unveil how the group binary decision-making result is determined by the coupled dynamics of these two processes. To this end, we propose an agent-based model to study the collective behaviors of individual binary decision-making process through competitive opinion dynamics on social networks. Three key factors are considered: bounded confidence that describes the cognitive scope of the population, stubbornness level that characterizes the opinion updating speed, and the opinion strength that represents the asymmetry power or attractiveness of the two choices. We find that bounded confidence plays an important role in determining competing evolution results. As bounded confidence grows, population opinions experience polarization to consensus, leading to the emergence of phase transition from co-existence to winner-takes-all state under binary decisions. Of particular interest, we show how the combined effects of bounded confidence and asymmetry opinion strength may reverse the initial supportive advantage in competitive dynamics. Notably, our model qualitatively reproduces the important dynamical pattern during a brutal competition, namely, cascading collapse, as observed by real data. Finally and intriguingly, we find that individual cognitive heterogeneity can bring about randomness and unpredictability in binary decision-making process, leading to the emergence of indeterministic oscillation.

People who are deprived of permanent housing have a high prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders, and need nimble, rapid, and portable harm reduction interventions to address the harms of criminalized substance use in an evidence-based manner. CASE STUDY: In February 2021, a COVID-19 outbreak was declared at an emergency mens shelter in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Building on pre-existing relationships, community and hospital-based addictions medicine providers and a local harm reduction group collaborated to establish a shelter-based opioid agonist treatment and safer supply program, and a volunteer run safer drug use space that also distributed harm reduction supplies. In the 4 weeks preceding the program, the rate of non-fatal overdoses was 0.93 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. During the 26 days of program operation, there were no overdoses in the safer use space and the rate of non-fatal overdoses in the shelter was 0.17 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. The odds ratio of non-fatal overdose pre-intervention to during intervention was 5.5 (95% CI 1.63C18.55, p = 0.0059). We were not able to evaluate the impact of providing harm reduction supplies and did not evaluate the impact of the program on facilitating adherence to public health isolation and quarantine orders. The program ended as the outbreak waned, as per the direction from the shelter operator. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in the non-fatal overdose rate after the safer drug use and safer supply harm reduction program was introduced. Pre-existing relationships between shelter providers, harm reduction groups, and healthcare providers were critical to implementing the program. This is a promising approach to reducing harms from the criminalization of substance use in congregate settings, particularly in populations with a higher prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders.","output":"The impact of an integrated safer use space and safer supply program on non-fatal overdose among emergency shelter residents during a COVID-19 outbreak: a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases of gadget addiction in the pandemic era have increased.

While COVID-19 has a very low morbidity rate across approximately 80% of the population, it has a high morbidity and mortality rate in the remaining 20% of the population.1 These numbers have put a significant strain on medical systems around the world. Patients with neuromuscular diseases such as those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), tend to be more medically fragile and have higher health care needs than the general population. Respiratory insufficiency, cardiac disease, obesity, and immunocompromised status due to chronic steroid treatments in certain patient populations with neuromuscular conditions are specific risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. In general, the pediatric population has shown to be less severely impacted with lower infection rates and lower morbidity and mortality rates than the adult population, however, as expected, children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of morbidity from COVID-19 than their peers.2 Many patients with neuromuscular disease also rely heavily on caregiver support through their lifetime and thus maintaining the health of their primary caregivers is also a significant consideration in the health and well-being of the patients.

The primary outcome is HbA1c. Secondary outcomes include diabetes distress, self-care, self-efficacy, weight, depressive symptoms, implementation barriers/facilitators, and costs. We hypothesize that the PRACTICE-DM intervention will reduce HbA1c by >0.6% versus standard HT over 12 months. Results Enrollment for this ongoing trial concluded in January 2020; 200 patients were randomized (99 to standard HT and 101 to the PRACTICE-DM intervention). The cohort has a mean age of 58 and is 23% female and 72% African American. Mean baseline HbA1c and BMI were 10.2% and 34.8 kg/m2. Conclusions Because it comprehensively targets factors underlying PPDM using existing clinical infrastructure, the PRACTICE-DM intervention may be well suited to lower the complications and costs of PPDM in routine practice.","output":"Practical Telehealth to improve control and engagement for patients with clinic-refractory diabetes mellitus (PRACTICE-DM): Protocol and baseline data for a randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 79-year-old Japanese man with polymyalgia rheumatica was admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Objective: Present study evaluated the possible socio-economic and health related factors (and their temporal consistency) determining the disease burden of COVID-19. Design: A retrospective analysis for identifying associations of COVID-19 burden. Setting: Data on COVID-19 statistics (number of cases, tests and deaths per million) was extracted from the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ on 10th April and 12th May. Variables obtained to estimate the possible determinants for COVID-19 burden included economic- gross domestic product; socio-demographic- Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs indicators related to health systems, percentage Chinese diaspora; and COVID-19 trajectory- date of first case in each country, days between first reported case and 10th April, days between 100th and 1000th case, and government response stringency index (GRSI). Main outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 burden was modeled using economic and socio-demographic determinants. Consistency of inferences for two time points at three levels of increasing statistical rigor using (i) Spearman correlations, (ii) Bayesian probabilistic graphical model, and (iii) counterfactual impact was evaluated. Results: Countries economy (reflected by GDP), mainly through the testing rates, was the major and temporally consistent determinant of COVID-19 burden in the model. Reproduction number of COVID-19 was lower where mortality due to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) was higher, thus strengthening the hygiene hypothesis. There was no association between vaccination status or tuberculosis incidence and COVID burden, refuting the claims over BCG vaccination as a possible factor against COVID-19 trajectory. Conclusion and Relevance: Countries economy, through testing power, was the major determinant of COVID-19 burden.

Among these is the investigation of the viral communities residing in the human body and their impact on health and disease. To this end, the study of samples from multiple tissues is critical, yet, the complexity of such analysis calls for a dedicated pipeline. We provide an automatic and efficient pipeline for identification, assembly, and analysis of viral genomes that combines the DNA sequence data from multiple organs. TRACESPipe relies on cooperation among 3 modalities: compression-based prediction, sequence alignment, and de novo assembly. The pipeline is ultra-fast and provides, additionally, secure transmission and storage of sensitive data. FINDINGS TRACESPipe performed outstandingly when tested on synthetic and ex vivo datasets, identifying and reconstructing all the viral genomes, including those with high levels of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It also detected minimal levels of genomic variation between different organs. CONCLUSIONS TRACESPipe's unique ability to simultaneously process and analyze samples from different sources enables the evaluation of within-host variability. This opens up the possibility to investigate viral tissue tropism, evolution, fitness, and disease associations. Moreover, additional features such as DNA damage estimation and mitochondrial DNA reconstruction and analysis, as well as exogenous-source controls, expand the utility of this pipeline to other fields such as forensics and ancient DNA studies.

However, no clinical studies have yet compared DARA maintenance versus SoC maintenance. The ongoing phase 3 AURIGA study will evaluate the addition of DARA to lenalidomide maintenance among pts with NDMM who are MRD positive after SoC induction and ASCT. The primary endpoint is the conversion rate to MRD negativity after 1 year of maintenance therapy. Methods: This openlabel, multi center, randomized phase 3 study will enroll approximately 214 pts in the United States aged 18-79 years with NDMM who receive 4 cycles of induction followed by ASCT. Pts must enroll within 6 months of ASCT, be na?ve for anti-CD38 treatment, have a very good partial response or better per IMWG criteria, and be MRD positive at a threshold of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS) within 30 days of screening.

Treatment will continue for up to 36 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint is MRD conversion rate after 12months of maintenance treatment, defined as the proportion of pts who achieve MRD negativity (10-5) by NGS. Additional MRD assessments occur after 18, 24, and 36 months of maintenance. While MRD negativity is associated with improved long-term outcomes for pts with MM and is an emerging, validated prognostic factor, this study is among the first to use MRD negativity as a primary study endpoint. Importantly, MRD negativity allows for earlier efficacy assessment than traditional endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include overall MRD conversion rate at any time, sustained MRD negativity lasting 12 months, PFS, OS, response rates, duration of complete response, changes in health-related quality of life, and safety. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has been amended to improve enrollment access by allowing up to 12 months from start of induction therapy to ASCT to mitigate against ASCT delays and to allow greater flexibility for screening and laboratory assessments.","output":"Subcutaneous daratumumab (DARA SC) plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are minimal residual disease (MRD) positive after frontline autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT): The phase 3 AURIGA study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To study the long-term psychological effects of Covid-19 disease, we recruited 61 patients older than 60 years of age and administered the Kessler questionnaire K10 to assess psychological distress and classify them according to mental health risk groups. Patients' affective temperaments were assessed with the 39-item form of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A-39) and emotional dysregulation with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Patients were divided in two samples according to their scores on the K10, i.e., a high likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 18) and a low likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 43).

The increasing mental health problems in nursing students may be related to a strong sense of shame they experience for having a mental health problem. Self-compassion has been identified as a protective factor for mental health and shame in other student populations. Further, studies highlight the importance of sleep relating to mental health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. METHODS: A convenient sampling of 182 nursing students at a university in the East Midlands completed a paper-based questionnaire regarding these four constructs, from February to April 2019. Correlation, regression and mediation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mental health problems were positively related to shame and negatively related to self-compassion and sleep. Mental health shame positively predicted and self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems: sleep was not a significant predictor of mental health problems. Lastly, self-compassion completely mediated the impacts of sleep on mental health problems (negative relationship between mental health problems and sleep was fully explained by self-compassion). CONCLUSION: The importance of self-compassion was highlighted as it can reduce mental health problems and shame. Self-compassion can protect nursing students from mental distress when they are sleep deprived. IMPACT: Nurses and nursing students are required to work irregular hours (e.g. COVID-19) and mental distress can cause serious consequences in clinical practice.

METHODS: Forty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: artemisinin-piperaquine (AP) group (n=23) and control group (n=18). The primary outcome was the time taken to reach undetectable levels of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the percentage of participants with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 on day 7, 10, 14, and 28. The computed tomography (CT) imaging changes within ten days, the corrected QT interval changes, adverse events, and abnormal laboratory parameters were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean time to reach undetectable viral RNA (mean standard deviation) was 10.61.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4-12.8) for AP group and 19.32.1 days (95% CI: 15.1-23.5) for the control group.

DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiological analysis. SETTING: Multiple healthcare facilities of secondary and tertiary care centres in an urban setting. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 185 laboratory-confirmed cases with partially known dates of illness onset and most likely sources of infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Superspreaders were identified using the transmission tree. The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts. RESULTS: A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p<0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0C8.6) and 28.6 (0.0C63.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others.

It becomes important to devise a way to achieve reliable immunity with lower doses to distribute limited supplies of vaccines to maximum number of people very quickly. Intradermal (ID) vaccination is one such method to increase the effectiveness of vaccines. However, this method has not been widely used in general clinical practice because it is technically difficult to inject vaccines precisely into the ID tissue. Therefore, new ID delivery systems that allow reliable ID administration are under development. In this paper, we summarize its design and present the results of performance and usability testing for the Immucise? Intradermal Injection System (Immucise?). This study showed that Immucise? can reduce dead volume and inject drugs precisely into the ID tissues of subjects from infants to the elderly and can be used correctly and safely by healthcare professionals. This randomized controlled trial compared ID administration with Immucise? and standard subcutaneous (SC) administration of seasonal influenza vaccine by analyzing the efficacy of the vaccine in the elderly group at 90 days and 180 days after administration. It was found that the vaccine for the ID group was as effective or more effective than that for the SC group up to 180 days later. It was also found that the geometric mean titer values, especially for B strains, were higher in the two-dose ID group than in the two-dose SC group.

To explore ethical care further, a set of salient ethical values for delivering care to care home residents living with dementia during the pandemic was derived from a synthesis of relevant ethical standards, codes and philosophical approaches. The ethical values identified were caring, non-maleficence, beneficence, procedural justice, dignity in death and dying, well-being, safety, and personhood. Using these ethical values as a framework, alongside examples from contemporaneous media and academic sources, this article discusses the delivery of ethical care to care home residents with dementia within the context of COVID-19. The analysis identifies positive examples of ethical values displayed by care home staff, care sector organisations, healthcare professionals and third sector advocacy organisations. However, concerns relating to the death rates, dignity, safety, well-being and personhood - of residents and staff - are also evident.

In this article we propose a new mechanism and suggest innovative therapeutic avenues for its prevention.

The latter leads to apoptosis and/or intense activation of inflammatory cytokines in the affected cells. We hypothesise that a similar phenomenon of dsDNA breaks and inflammation is involved in cytokine storm. The abundant cfCh particles that are released from dying host cells following viral/microbial invasion initiate a cascading effect of more cell death resulting in a vicious cycle of further DNA damage, apoptosis and hyper-inflammation which culminate in cytokine storm. We propose that this unrelenting vicious cycle of cellular DNA damage and cytokine storm may be the underlying cause of high mortality from severe COVID-19.

The widespread COVID-19 caused the lockdown of the cities and economic losses. On the other hand, tuberculosis is among the ten highest human killers. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of pulmonary epidemic diseases is the primary step in clinical treatment.

This article is a timely examination of public audit strategies from national audit offices, assessing whether they are likely to deliver the objectives of the new normal, for example with the increased focus on digital transformation, work methods, communication and collaboration. It also contributes to the now long-standing practice of shared learning by public audit offices around the world. The article includes national audit offices' reactions to the changes needed post Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a marked, and continuing, impact on most countries and virtually all sectors of their economies-not least on government and its various institutions. There is international recognition that the \`new normal' will require more than some transitional adjustments within and across the various sectors, not least the public sector, but also requires research and analysis by the academic community (Ansell et al., 2021). This article's main focus is on the published strategic intentions for future audits by a selection of national audit offices that have provided the most detail of such intentions. A number of other national audit, or similar, offices/courts was also reviewed to ascertain any marked differences of intentions because of the different impacts of the pandemic and government actions taken. It is not only an examination of those intentions but also of the allied question as to whether/how audit offices have, or are acquiring, the necessary systems and expertise for their effective implementation. Both academics and practitioners will need to address short and longer term frameworks and processes to make a successful transition to the \`new normal'.

METHODS: Between May and December 2019, 100 patients requiring hip or knee arthroplasty were enrolled with the intention that each would have a preadmission discharge plan, a preoperative education class with nominated helper, a day of surgery admission and mobilization, a day one discharge, and access to a 24/7 dedicated helpline. Each was matched with a patient under the pre-existing pathway from the previous year. RESULTS: Mean LOS for ERAS patients was 1.59 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 2.04), significantly less than that of the matched cohort (3.01 days; 95% CI 2.56 to 3.46). There were no significant differences in readmission rates for ERAS patients at both 30 and 90 days (six vs four readmissions at 30 days, and nine vs four at 90 days). Despite matching, there were significantly more American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 3 patients in the ERAS cohort. There was a mean cost saving of 757.26 (95% CI -1,200.96 to -313.56) per patient. This is despite small increases in postoperative resource usage in the ERAS patients. CONCLUSION: ERAS represents a safe and effective means of reducing LOS in primary joint arthroplasty patients.

As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities. METHODS: We undertook a mixed methods study seeking the views of the global research community to (1) assess which of the early WHO roadmap priorities are still most pressing; (2) understand whether they are still valid in different settings, regions or countries; and (3) identify any new emerging priorities. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of the significant body of combined data shows the WHO roadmap is globally relevant; however, new important priorities have emerged, in particular, pertinent to low and lower middle-income countries (less resourced countries), where health systems are under significant competing pressures. We also found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future.

Results are presented as Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%C.I.) and absolute risk differences (RD) in deaths per 1,000 COVID-19 patients. FindingsWe included 88 cohort studies with age/gender adjusted data from 6,653,207 SARS-CoV-2 patients from Europe. Hospital-based mortality was associated with high and moderate certainty evidence for solid organ tumours, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, liver disease, and obesity, while a higher risk, albeit with low certainty, was noted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure.

We make use of an augmentation of the standard distillation module with an auxiliary intermediate assistant network that aids in the continuity of the flow of information. Following this approach, we are able to build an extremely light student network, consisting of just 3 convolutional blocks without any compromise on accuracy. We thus propose a method of classification of diseases which can not only lead to faster screening, but can also operate seamlessly on low-end devices.","output":"A distillation based approach for the diagnosis of diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study was to observe the temporal changes in the chest based on findings from imaging in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. A total of 33 severe confirmed cases (20 male patients and 13 female patients) were enrolled in the present study between January 31, 2020 and March 10, 2020. Chest imaging findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The median age was 65 years (age range, 25-90 years). As of April 7, 2020, 24 patients were discharged, and 9 patients died. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 28 patients had fever, 17 patients had a cough and 15 patients had shortness of breath. Of these, 29 patients had underlying health conditions. Ground glass opacities, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening were the most common and typical chest computerized tomography (CT) scan abnormalities. A total of 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 1 affected lobe, 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 5/33 (15.2%) patients had 3 affected lobes, 9/33 (27.3%) patients had 4 affected lobes and 7/33 (21.2%) patients had 5 affected lobes in the initial chest CT scan. The mean interval time between two consecutive CT examinations was 4.5 days (range, 3-9 days). Most severe patients exhibited some degree of aggravation based on the CT findings in the 3 weeks from illness onset. After 3 weeks from illness onset, these severe survivors demonstrated improvements in the chest CT findings, which included complete absorption or only a few remaining fibrous stripes. Chest CT manifestations of patients infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia were diverse and varied. Severe patients had imaging features of rapid progression and slow absorption.

Ten aromatic oils (lavender, rosemary, rose, eucalyptus, jasmine, geranium, chamomile, clary sage, thyme, and peppermint) were used on 23 women aged between 20 and 60 years. They inhaled the scent for 90 s through a glass funnel attached to their lab apron, 10 cm below their nose, while the pump was activated. Electroencephalography, blood pressure, and pulse rate were measured before and during inhalation of the aroma oils. The relative alpha (RA) power spectrums indicating relaxation and resting state of the brain significantly increased when lavender, rosemary, eucalyptus, jasmine, chamomile, clary sage, and thyme oils were inhaled compared to those of before olfactory stimulation. The ratio of alpha to high beta (RAHB), an indicator of brain stability and relaxation, significantly increased when rosemary, jasmine, clary sage, and peppermint oils were inhaled. The relative low beta (RLB) power spectrum, an indicator of brain activity in the absence of stress, significantly increased when stimulated with lavender, rosemary, rose, and geranium scents. Further, systolic blood pressure significantly decreased after introduction of all 10 types of aromatic oils, which indicates stress reduction.

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","output":"A deterministic linear infection model to inform Risk-Cost-Benefit Analysis of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of our study was to explore the impact of elective-surgery deferment on the United States health-care system and subsequent recovery after COVID-19 containment.

(2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 monthsin optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectivelyuntil the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery.

In this context, engagement, a mental state to enhance the learning process, has been brought into the limelight. However, the existing engagement datasets are of a small scale and not suitable for education time-series research. We proposed an estimation method on time-series face and body features captured by built-in PC cameras to improve the engagement estimation on small and irregularly wild datasets. We designed upper body features using the facial and body key points extracted from OpenPose. To reduce the influence of the extracted noises from OpenPose, the moving average, the average value of a fixed period in the videos, is used to process the training data. Then, we compose a time-series dataset of online tasks with 19 participants. In the composed dataset, there remained self-reports of participants mental state and external observation to confirm the different engagement levels in the answering process. The combined self-reports and external observation results were used as the engagement label. Finally, the transfer learning was used to solve the insufficient data issue.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies in the English language assessing effects of proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists on PICU patients published before October 2018 from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. Random-effect Mantel-Haenszel risk difference (MHRD) model was used to pool all the selected studies for meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included mortality and length of PICU stay. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 13 observational) comprising 340,763 patients were included. Overall incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 15.2%. There was no difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (MHRD 5.0%; 95%CI -1.0% to 11.0%, I2=62%) between SUP status. There was increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia for patients who received SUP (MHRD 5.3%; 95%CI 3.5% to 7.0%; I2=0%) compared with those who did not. An increased risk of mortality was found in patients receiving SUP (MHRD 2.1%; 95%CI 2.0% to 2.2%; I2=0%), although when one large study was removed in a sensitivity analysis this association was no longer found. No statistical difference was found in length of PICU stay between the groups (standardized mean difference 0.42; 95%CI -0.16 to 1.01 days; I2=89.8%).

Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of ?87.01  5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds.

To test the potential role of vegetables in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of Brassica vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, head cabbage (white, red and savoy cabbage), leafy brassica) and to compare them with spinach, cucumber, courgette, lettuce and tomato. The COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people over 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage of obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only head cabbage and cucumber reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g/day increase in the average national consumption of some of the vegetables (head cabbage and cucumber), the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by a factor of 11, down to 13.6 %. Lettuce consumption increased COVID-19 mortality. The adjustment did not change the point estimate and the results were still significant.

Limited access to specialized care facilities and expanding patient populations, combined with unprecedented mobility restrictions imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, are currently stressing the need for remote solutions in this field. Studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefits, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Nonetheless, data on live interaction between patients and health care providers for MS teleconsultation purposes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet for patients with MS. METHODS: A total of 20 patients with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled for each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience, and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Out of 20 consultations, 17 were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (n=2) and technical issues (n=1). Out of the 17 consultations, 17 patients declared themselves satisfied or highly satisfied for technical quality, 15 patients for convenience, and 16 patients for overall quality of care.

This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (N = 1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020. RESULTS: Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak.

These measures also have an impact on peoples daily life (closure of school/businesses, teleworking, recommendation to stay at home). This can cause stress on social, economic and psychological levels and thereby can trigger domestic violence. Besides, confinement also fosters social isolation, which can complicate help seeking behaviour. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of domestic violence during the coronavirus crisis and to assess whether victims of domestic violence experienced more social isolation than nonvictims. Methods Several online COVID-19 health surveys were organised among Belgian residents aged 18 + via snowball sampling. This study is based on the second (April 2020) and the sixth survey (March 2021). After excluding 1-person households and missing data, the sample size was respectively 25,251 and 12,589. Weighted prevalence of domestic violence was evaluated for the two surveys. The association (OR (95% CI)) between domestic violence and subjective social isolation was assessed with logistic regression stratified by survey, adjusted for covariates and taking post-stratification weights into account. Results In April 2020, 4.0% of the adult population reported being a victim of domestic violence (1.2% in the health interview survey 2018);in March 2021, this was 6.2%. In April 2020, victims of domestic violence had a higher odds of perceived weak social support (2.23 (1.76C2.82)) and of having less confidence in health care services (1.78 (1.21C2.63)). In March 2021, victims had a higher odds of perceived weak social support (1.98 (1.27C3.09)), but also of being unsatisfied with their social contacts (1.81 (1.16C2.84)) and of perceived social (2.70 (1.77C4.13)) and emotional loneliness (2.40 (1.45C3.97)). Conclusions Compared to 2018, more people reported domestic violence since the coronavirus crisis. Victims of domestic violence feel more often socially isolated. Although confinement is needed to counteract the virus, it can put people in a dangerous situation since they do not get the help they need. Therefore, adequate support is essential.","output":"Domestic Violence During the COVID-19 Confinement: Do Victims Feel more Socially Isolated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-COV-2 has caused millions of deaths in less than one year, yet little is known about the long-term consequences survivors may suffer. The novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor to infect human cells, allowing it to target organ systems with such receptors including the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and endocrine system. The purpose of this case report is to describe the long-term implications COVID-19 may cause in the endocrine system. A 46-year-old woman was referred to our clinic due to abrupt uncontrolled blood glucose levels ranging from 200-550mg/dL after being infected with COVID-19 for approximately 10 weeks. She has a past medical history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 which was diagnosed 3 years ago and was well controlled with diet. Present history reveals polyuria, polydipsia, tiredness and a decreased appetite. Laboratory values show HbA1C 12, negative islet cell antibodies/GAD antibodies, low C-peptide, high TSH, normal FT4 and positive anti-TPO antibodies/thyroglobulin antibodies. The sudden loss of blood glucose control along with low c peptide levels without evidence of autoimmunity support the diagnosis of Pancreatic Diabetes.

Although all people are exposed to air pollution, the older population (ie, those aged 60 years) tends to be disproportionally affected. As a result, there is growing concern about the health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. METHODS In this global analysis, we developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) to estimate the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM25 pollution using Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age-specific and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) attributable to PM25 pollution using the global exposure mortality model and global estimates of exposure at 01  01 (about 11 km  11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLLs within each age group into a health-related cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM25. Finally, we did a sensitivity test to analyse the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and concentration-response functions by age, cause, country, and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing power parity-adjusted US dollars. All simulations were done with R, version 3.6.0. FINDINGS Globally, in 2016, PM25 was estimated to have caused 842 million (95% UI 650-1052) attributable deaths, which was associated with 16368 million (11603-21944) YLLs. In 2016, the global economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM25 pollution for the older population was US$240 trillion (189-293) accounting for 59% (59-60) of the cost for the total population ($409 trillion [319-505]). The economic cost per capita for the older population was $2739 (2160-3345) in 2016, which was 10 times that of the younger population (ie, those aged <60 years). By assessing the factors that contributed to economic costs, we found that increases in these factors changed the total economic cost by 77% for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 21% for population ageing, 16% for population growth, -41% for age-specific mortality, and -04% for PM25 exposure. INTERPRETATION The economic cost of ambient PM25 borne by the older population almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population ageing, and population growth. Compared with younger people, air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs among older people, even after accounting for their relatively shorter life expectancy and increased disability. As the world's population is ageing, the disproportionate health cost attributable to ambient PM25 pollution potentially widens the health inequities for older people. Countries with severe air pollution and rapid ageing rates need to take immediate actions to improve air quality. In addition, strategies aimed at enhancing health-care services, especially targeting the older population, could be beneficial for reducing the health costs of ambient air pollution.

Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation is an effective surgical treatment, one of the reasons is because AM is a rich source of growth factors that can promote epithelialization and wound healing. However, growth factors will be gradually lost and insufficient after preparation process and long-time storage, leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, we present a modified AM (AM-HEP) for the supplement and sustained release of growth factor by surface grafting heparin for treatment of ocular chemical burns. Heparin grafting rate and stability, microstructure, physical property, and sustained release of epithelial growth factor (EGF) of AM-HEP were characterized. Biocompatibility and ability to promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration were evaluated and compared with a biological amnion, which is available on the market in vitro. The therapeutic effects of AM-HEP combined with EGF (AM-HEP@EGF) in vivo had been evaluated in a model of mouse corneal alkali burn. The results indicated that heparin was introduced into AM and maintain stability over 3 weeks at 37C. The modification process of AM-HEP did not affect microstructure and physical property after comparing with non-modified AM. EGF could be combined quickly and effectively with AM-HEP; the sustained release could last for more than 14 days. AM-HEP@EGF could significantly promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration, compared with non-modified AM and control group. Faster corneal epithelialization was observed with the transplantation of AM-HEP@EGF in vivo, compared with the untreated control group. The corneas in the AM-HEP@EGF group have less inflammation and were more transparent than those in the control group. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that AM-HEP@EGF could significantly enhance the therapeutic effects. Taken together, AM-HEP@EGF is exhibited to be a potent clinical application in corneal alkali burns through accelerating corneal epithelial wound healing.","output":"Heparin-Modified Amniotic Membrane Combined With Growth Factors for Promoting Corneal Wound Healing After Alkali Burn"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academic stress has been a common topic among college students for many years. An individual's health and academic performance might be harmed when stress is perceived negatively or becomes severe. BPED fourth-year students' stress levels, the consequence of stress on their academic performance, and stress management practices were examined in the research. The researcher gathered information from the BPED fourth-year students at BulSU-Bustos Campus using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) standard questionnaire form through this convergent mixed method-descriptive study. The researchers used a total enumeration in this study (N = 62) with their consent to answer the questionnaire. All of them responded to the questionnaire used in this research study. Specifically, it results in a stress level of moderate (M = 20.68) with a score of 56 out of 62, or 90.32%, of students, which means that most of the students are moderately stressed. Stress on academic performance was recorded as an \\"agree\\" with a mean score of 3.48, meaning stress is connected to the BPED students academically. Findings from the study revealed that the majority of BPEd fourth-year students at BSU-Bustos Campus are frequently unhappy due to an unanticipated development. The findings of the study led researchers to recommend the following: Stress management tactics include time management, happiness, tranquility, and prayer. Plan a series of seminars or public speeches to raise awareness of the problem of stress. The guidance program in school may upgrade their strategies to encourage students and assist them in developing a more positive view of stress.

Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. Results: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged &gt;= 60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]);and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]).

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using data from extremely low birth weight infants who were monitored for HRC during neonatal intensive care. Surviving infants were assessed for NDI at 18-22 months of age. Multivariable predictive modeling of subsequent death or NDI using logistic regression, cross-validation with repeats, and step-wise feature elimination was performed each postnatal day through day 60. RESULTS: Among the 598 study participants, infants with the composite outcome of death or moderate-to-severe NDI had higher mean HRC scores during their stay in the NICU (3.1  1.8 vs 1.3  0.8; P < .001).

However, current data are based mainly on studies from centres with a large volume of ablations, as they include technically inhomogeneous interventions, and populations with different types of AF. The aim of our study was to assess and stratify the risk at 6 and 12 months for AFR after a single RFCA, in patients with paroxysmal AF, in a centre with low volume activity. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 40 patients who underwent an initial RFCA, followed by continuous 48 h ECG monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients self-monitored their cardiac activity by random daily radial pulse palpation or in the presence of palpitations. Results: Ten independent predictors for late AFR were identified, and a 6-month risk score was computed using three of them: AFR duration in the first month, number of AFR between 1 and 3 months, and supraventricular ectopics per 24 h at 6 months. The score can explain 59% of the AFR (p = 0.001). A further 12-month assessment identified three independent predictors. The presence of AFR between 6C12 months is the most important of them (OR = 23.11, 95% CI = 3.87C137.83, p = 0.001), explaining 45% of AFR over 1 year.

Therefore, we propose to describe the process designed to facilitate the communication of inpatients with their families to detect their needs and perform individualized treatments in each case. METHOD: Qualitative study with action research methodology, responding to the following algorithm: plan the action, diagnosis of the need and hypothesis-action; apply the action, creation of the group of case managers and training of the members; observe the action, collect and analyse the information. During the month of April 2020. RESULTS: 1,754 interactions were undertaken, that affected 490 inpatients. Case Managers made 767 calls, to provide information about admissions (71.45%), changes in inpatient location or operation of units (18.84%), among others. One thousand and ninety-eight calls from family members were received requesting medical information (43.8%), to talk to inpatients (18.48%), to deliver personal articles or manage lost objects (12.84%), and seeking information about patient location or medical discharge (10.20%). Sixty-six percent of the requests were solved by Case Managers, 30% were referred on and 4% could not be solved.

We found a major common PS binding site at the connection of the S-protein stalk and head. The molecules of Zn-PcChol(8+) and MB also form electrostatic encounter complexes with large area of negative electrostatic potential at the head of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, between fusion protein and heptad repeat 1 domain.

However, it remained unknown how tuberculosis (TB) epidemics are impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. The purposes of this study are to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the decreases in the TB case notifications and to forecast the epidemiological trends in China. METHODS: The monthly TB incidents from January 2005 to December 2020 were taken. Then, we investigated the causal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the TB case reductions using intervention analysis under the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) method. Next, we split the observed values into different training and testing horizons to validate the forecasting performance of the BSTS method. RESULTS: The TB incidence was falling during 2005C2020, with an average annual percentage change of ?3.186 (95% confidence interval [CI] ?4.083 to ?2.281), and showed a peak in MarchCApril and a trough in JanuaryCFebruary per year. The BSTS method assessed a monthly average reduction of 14% (95% CI 3.8% to 24%) in the TB case notifications from JanuaryCDecember 2020 owing to COVID-19 (probability of causal effect=99.684%, P=0.003), and this method generated a highly accurate forecast for all the testing horizons considering the small forecasting error rates and estimated a continued downward trend from 2021 to 2035 (annual percentage change =?2.869, 95% CI ?3.056 to ?2.681). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can cause medium- and longer-term consequences for the TB epidemics and the BSTS model has the potential to forecast the epidemiological trends of the TB incidence, which can be recommended as an automated application for public health policymaking in China. Considering the slow downward trend in the TB incidence, additional measures are required to accelerate the progress of the End TB Strategy.","output":"Estimating the Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Reductions in Tuberculosis Cases and the Epidemiological Trends in China: A Causal Impact Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An ordinary system of differential equations leading to a simulation model is propose as methodological approach to analysis the incidence of infectious-contagious diseases, in this case using SARS-CoV-2 virus as pathogenic model.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a smooth manner, thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific input.

Methods: This case-control study was conducted in Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran, Iran, from 26th Feb - 26th March 2020. The case group composed of 60 SM-exposed survivors infected with COVID-19, and the control group was composed of 60 patients with COVID-19. Groups were matched for demographic (including age and gender) and comorbidity variables except for lung disease which was higher in the case group. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and imaging manifestations, as well as outcomes, were compared between the two groups. Results: While the majority of patients in the case and control groups had at least one comorbidity like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, only lung disease was significantly higher in the case than in the control group (P=0.001). Patients in both groups displayed a variety of symptoms on arrival. Only chest pain was significantly more frequent in case patients than those in the control group. The levels of Neutrophils, ESR, BS, AST, LDH, and CRP in both groups were higher, and Na levels were lower than the normal range. Neutrophils were significantly higher in the case than in the control group (p=0.02). The BUN level was significantly lower in the control than in the case group (p=0.04). Other laboratory findings were within their normal ranges and similar in both groups. Significantly more patients in the case group showed early-stage opacities than those in the control group (p=.03). There were no significant differences in treatment or outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: Most clinical characteristics, outcomes, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in SMexposed survivors, were similar to those in the non-exposed.

However, a growing body of literature has recognized that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in this global trend, but the association has not yet been fully established. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: EDCs can interfere with normal hormone function and metabolism and play a role in pubertal onset. We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the current evidence on the timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys following prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs. SEARCH METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in the PubMed database through a block search approach using a combination of index MeSH and free text search terms. Publications were considered if they covered biomarkers of prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs (European Commission's list of category 1 EDCs) measured in maternal or child biospecimen and pubertal onset defined by the progression of the following milestones (and assessed in terms of the following measures): menarche (age), thelarche (Tanner staging) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in girls, and genital stage (Tanner staging), testicular volume (ml) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in boys. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 703 references, of which we identified 52 publications fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the qualitative trend synthesis and 23 publications for the meta-analysis. The qualitative trend synthesis provided data on 103 combinations of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure to EDC compounds groups and puberty outcomes and the meta-analysis enabled 18 summary risk estimates of meta-associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Statistically significant associations in the qualitative trend synthesis suggested that postnatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with earlier thelarche and later pubarche. However, we did not find consistent evidence in the meta-analysis for associations between timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys and exposures to any of the studied xenobiotic EDCs. We were not able to identify specific pre- or postnatal windows of exposure as particularly critical and susceptible for effects of EDCs. Current evidence is subject to several methodological challenges and inconsistencies and evidence on specific exposure-outcome associations remains too scarce to firmly confirm EDC exposure as a risk factor for changes in age of pubertal onset in the general child population. To create a more uniform foundation for future comparison of evidence and to strengthen pooled studies, we recommend the use of more standardized approaches in the choice of statistical analyses, with exposure transformations, and in the definitions and assessments of puberty outcomes. The impact of mixtures of EDC exposures on the association also remains unestablished and would be valuable to elucidate for prenatal and postnatal windows of exposure. Future large, longitudinal epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the overall association.","output":"Prenatal and postnatal exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals and timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the most lethal transmissible infections characterized by a high fatality rate, and a treatment has not been developed yet.

In the present work, we investigated how amiodarone interferes with Ebola virus infection. Wild-type Sudan ebolavirus and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudotyped with the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, were used to gain further insight into the ability of amiodarone to affect Ebola virus infection. We show that amiodarone decreases Ebola virus infection at concentrations close to those found in the sera of patients treated for arrhythmias. The drug acts by interfering with the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. We also show that MDEA, the main amiodarone metabolite, contributes to the antiviral activity.

Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level.

Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared. Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease. The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome.","output":"The Pathology and Pathogenesis of Experimental Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Influenza in Animal Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This paper describes and reports the patient-specific characteristics of an urgent dental care clinic for COVID-19 infected, suspected, exposed or quarantined patients from March to December 2020 in the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Finland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The triage and the treatment protocol were established based on the scientific data. Patient files were evaluated from the hospital district's electronic medical record system. IBM SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were 1114 consultations and 257 visits at the clinic. Most of the patients were generally healthy with mean age of 35, had toothache and were suspected to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Seventeen of the patients received positive tests for COVID-19 infection. The main treatment was tooth extraction, mostly due to caries. Statistically significant differences between COVID-19 infected and other patients occurred in age (45 vs 34 years-of-age, p = .009) and number of teeth (25 vs 28, p = .031). No SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission chains were traced to the clinic.

In this study, we have reported the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, the frequency of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations, and their apoptosis pattern in Iranian coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) patients. Demographic and clinical data of 61 hospitalized confirmed cases with COVID-19 at Imam Khomeini Hospital were collected and analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from all samples and the apoptosis pattern was evaluated using Annexin V/propidium iodide method. The frequency of lymphocyte subsets, including T-CD4+ , T-CD8+ , NK, B cells, and monocytes, was measured in all patients and 31 controls by flow cytometry. Our findings demonstrated that the percentage of lymphocytes, CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Regarding the clinical severity, the number of lymphocytes, CD4+ , CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were also decreased in severe cases when compared with mild cases. Finally, our data have also indicated the increase in apoptosis of mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients which was more remarkable in severe clinical cases. The frequency of immune cells is a useful indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Research should continue on both the safety and efficacy of AlGaN-based Far-UVC LEDs, as well as the material choices and device designs to develop highly efficient solid-state UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 222 nm emission to replace toxic low-pressure mercury lamps emitting at 253.7 nm. However, the key issue of hole concentration inside the multi-quantum-wells (MQWs) of AlGaN-based Far-UVC LEDs with high Al-contents is quite critical. Therefore, theoretical studies of AlGaN-based Far-UVC LEDs may suggest sufficient evidence for immediate consideration and implementation for the epitaxial growth of 222 nm-band Far-UVC LED technology during this world-wide health crisis. In this paper, the initial design of the Al-graded p-AlGaN hole source layer (HSL) on the performances of Far-UVC LED was compared with conventional bulk p-AlGaN HSL (non-graded)-based LED devices. For the evaluation of the device's performances, the energy band diagram, internal quantum efficiency (IQE), electrons and holes concentration, radiative recombination rate, and current density vs voltage characteristic were compared. It was found that LEDs at 222 nm emission without using the undoped (ud)-AlGaN final-quantum-barrier (FQB) and only keeping the Al-graded Mg-doped p-AlGaN HSL showed high carrier injection into the MQWs. The variation in the energy band diagram around the p-AlGaN electron-blocking layer (EBL)/p-AlGaN HSL region and p-AlGaN HSL/p-GaN contact-layer (CL) indicates that the introduction of the Al-graded p-AlGaN HSL, as well as the special choice of Al composition at the interfaces, are quite promising for the enhancement of hole injection toward MQWs. The simulation results suggest that the proposed structure of the Al-graded p-AlGaN HSL after omitting the ud-AlGaN FQB structure in the Far-UVC LED is quite useful for achieving high peak efficiency, as well as for suppressing the efficiency droop when compared to the conventional bulk Far-UVC LED. After introducing a new design of 40 nm-thick p-AlGaN HSL in the Far-UVC LED, the radiative recombination rate in the first two quantum-wells of MQWs has been improved up to similar to 50%. The enhanced radiative recombination rate is attributed to the enhanced level of electron and hole concentrations by similar to 26% and 53%, respectively, in the MQWs. Ultimately, after removing the ud-AlGaN FQB and using 40 nm-thick Al-graded (Al: 100% to 20%) p-AlGaN HSL, the efficiency droop has been remarkably reduced from similar to 39% (Bulk-LED) to similar to 19% in the new design of Far-UVC LED structure.","output":"Polarization-dependent hole generation in 222 nm-band AlGaN-based Far-UVC LED: a way forward to the epi-growers of MBE and MOCVD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world resulting in more than 2 million confirmed cases The World Health Organization (WHO) also declared the COVID-19 disease as pandemic on 11 March 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the global financial market, which includes Malaysia This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Malaysian stock market The dependent variables used in this study were the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) and 13 other sectorial indices The independent variables were (i) the number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, China, and USA;(ii) the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Malaysia, China, and USA;(iii) the volatility index, and (iv) the Brent oil price The sample period of this study covered from 31st December 2019 to 18th April 2020 The findings showed that higher numbers of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia tended to adversely affect the performance of the KLCI index and all sectorial indices, except for the Real Estate Investment Fund (REIT) index The results also showed that the Brent oil price and the volatility index tended to affect the Malaysian stock market performance The results of this study can help investors understand the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors in Malaysia","output":"Impact of Covid-19: Evidence from Malaysian Stock Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical doctors consider data quality management a secondary priority when delivering health care.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the respiration rate and the inherent and external quality of watercress inoculated with B. subtilis and packaged as a fresh-cut product and stored at 4 C for 11 days. Watercress was grown using continuous flotation (FL) in a greenhouse using substrate disinfection and inoculated or not with Bacillus subtilis as a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The fresh-cut watercress respiration rate and phytochemical profile changed during the shelf life. The inherent phytochemical compounds were retained during the storage of the fresh-cut salad bags. The best results were found in watercress grown in a disinfected substrate but were less satisfactory when seeds and substrates were inoculated with PGPR. In general, the external quality and the pigment contents progressively decreased during the shelf life and the browning enzyme activities responsible for phenolic oxidation increased at different intensities throughout storage. At the end of the shelf-life period, the fresh weight loss of the fresh-cut product was less than 1% of the original weight. The results demonstrated that watercress grown in FL is a standardised baby leaf vegetable that is suitable for processing in the fresh-cut industry and for storing for more than 10 days.

BBS is characterized by elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the early stages of adipocyte and retinal development. BBS expression in the CNS and indications of hippocampal dysgenesis suggest neural development abnormalities. However, the role of BBS in ER stress in neuronal cells has not yet been studied. Therefore, we aimed at studying the role of BBS4 in neuronal development under normal and ER stress conditions. ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) were studied in BBS4-silenced (SiBBS4) SH-SY5Y cells during differentiation under normal and stress states, using molecular and biochemical markers. ER stress was demonstrated at early neural differentiation, with significantly augmented expression of UPR markers corresponding to BBS4 expression. In the undifferentiated state, BBS4 silencing resulted in significantly reduced ER-stress markers' expression under normal and ER-stress states. Independent of ER stress, SiBBS4 cells demonstrated significant reduction in activated phospho-IRE1&#945;. Under BBS4 silencing, both sXBP-1 and activated ATF6&#945; p50 failed to translocate to the nucleus. Transcript levels of apoptosis markers were upregulated under BBS4 depletion and ER-stress induction, corresponding to decreased viability. BBS4 depletion in neuronal cells results in reduced sensitivity to ER stress during differentiation and under ER-stress induction, partly due to failure in translocation of ER-transcription factors (TF) sXBP-1 and ATF6&#945; p50 to the nucleus. Hence, BBS4 is essential for nuclear transport under ER-stress response in neuronal cells during early differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical characteristics associated with delirium as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in older adults and develop a logistic regression to predict the likelihood of delirium. METHOD: We compared clinical characteristics in an age- and gender-matched sample of 68 delirious individuals with 68 nondelirious individuals (Mage= 78) who presented to the ED with COVID-19. RESULTS: The delirious group was more likely to have neurologic, psychiatric, and cardiovascular comorbidities; a prior history of delirium; and deliriogenic medications in their medication list. They were less likely to present with respiratory symptoms and more likely to present with sepsis, hypoxia, higher heart rate, and higher sodium. The delirious group had higher mortality (51%) than the nondelirious group (32%). Delirium developed within an average of 2 days of initial COVID-19 symptom onset, with symptom onset to ED within an average of 4 days and symptom onset to death within an average of 11 days. Logistic regression based on five delirium predictors correctly predicted 80% of those with delirium (75% sensitivity at 86% specificity).

However, most offer little support on how to have these conversations in practice. Clinicians fear that health behaviour change talk will create interactional difficulties and discomfort for both clinician and patient. This review aims to identify how healthcare professionals can best communicate with patients about health behaviour change (HBC). METHODS We included studies which used conversation analysis or discourse analysis to study recorded interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. We followed an aggregative thematic synthesis approach. This involved line-by-line coding of the results and discussion sections of included studies, and the inductive development and hierarchical grouping of descriptive themes. Top-level themes were organised to reflect their conversational positioning. RESULTS Of the 17,562 studies identified through systematic searching, ten papers were included. Analysis resulted in 10 top-level descriptive themes grouped into three domains: initiating; carrying out; and closing health behaviour change talk. Of three methods of initiation, two facilitated further discussion, and one was associated with outright resistance. Of two methods of conducting behaviour change talk, one was associated with only minimal patient responses. One way of closing was identified, and patients did not seem to respond to this positively. Results demonstrated a series of specific conversational practices which clinicians use when talking about HBC, and how patients respond to these. Our results largely complemented clinical guidelines, providing further detail on how they can best be delivered in practice. However, one recommended practice - linking a patient's health concerns and their health behaviours - was shown to receive variable responses and to often generate resistance displays. CONCLUSIONS Health behaviour change talk is smoothly initiated, conducted, and terminated by clinicians and this rarely causes interactional difficulty. However, initiating conversations by linking a person's current health concern with their health behaviour can lead to resistance to advice, while other strategies such as capitalising on patient initiated discussions, or collaborating through question-answer sequences, may be well received.","output":"Communication practices for delivering health behaviour change conversations in primary care: a systematic review and thematic synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 was first reported, different neurological complications have been acknowledged, but their description is constantly evolving.

A broad repertoire of memory T-cells must be developed and maintained to effectively protect against viral invasions; yet, the total number of memory T-cells is constrained between infections.

Furthermore, some viruses induce memory T-cell death early in an infection, after which surviving cells proliferate to refill the memory compartment. We develop mathematical models of cellular attrition and proliferation in order to examine how new viral infections impact existing immunity. With these probabilistic models, we qualitatively and quantitatively predict how the composition and diversity of the memory repertoire changes as a result of viral infections. In addition, we calculate how often immunity to prior diseases is lost due to new infections. Comparing our results across multiple general infection types allows us to draw conclusions about, which types of viral effects most drastically alter existing immunity. We find that early memory attrition does not permanently alter the repertoire composition, while infections that spark substantial new memory generation drastically shift the repertoire and hasten the decline of existing immunity.","output":"Mathematical Models of Memory CD8(+) T-Cell Repertoire Dynamics in Response to Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Los captulos de imagen de la Asociacin Nacional de Cardilogos de Mxico (ANCAM) y de la Sociedad Mexicana de Cardiologa (SMC), as como personal del Departamento de Medicina y Nutricin de la Universidad de Guanajuato, en conjunto con destacados expertos de la imagen cardiovascular en Mxico, han colaborado en la revisin, anlisis y ampliacin de las diversas estrategias sanitarias publicadas en los primeros 15 meses de la pandemia de enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) para realizar con seguridad los estudios de imagen cardiaca; esta actualizacin tiene como objetivo principal disminuir el riesgo de transmisin de la COVID-19 entre los pacientes y el personal de salud en los servicios de tomografa, resonancia y cardiologa nuclear.

Participants were recruited 4 to 12 weeks after cancer diagnosis as part of the VIE study. The one-year nutritional intervention included an initial evaluation and 6 follow-up visits every 2 months with a registered dietician. The feasibility assessment included rates of retention, participation, attendance, completion of study measures, and participants engagement. A preliminary evaluation of the interventions impact on the participants dietary intakes was conducted. A total of 62 participants were included in the study (51.6% male, mean age = 8.5 years, mean time since diagnosis = 13.2 weeks). The retention and attendance rates were 72.6% and 71.3%, respectively. Attendance to follow-up visits declined over time, from 83.9% to 48.9%. A majority of participants had high participation (50.8%) and high engagement (56.4%). Measures of body-mass-index or weight-for-length ratio and dietary 24-h recalls were the procedures with the highest completion rates. Participants with refractory disease or relapse were less likely to complete the intervention. Post-intervention, participants (n = 21) had a lower sodium intake compared to the initial evaluation. These results suggest that a nutritional intervention that involves patients and parents early after a pediatric cancer diagnosis is feasible.","output":"Early Nutritional Intervention to Promote Healthy Eating Habits in Pediatric Oncology: A Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Death is a widely used outcome to assess the severity of pandemics. Accuracy in assigning the cause of death is of vital importance to define the impact of the agent, monitor its evolution, and compare its threat with those of other agents. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread reporting of aggregate death data with little attention paid to the accuracy of the assignment of causation. We aimed to analyse public authorities' understanding of the assignment of cause of deaths during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK by accessing Freedom of Information requests posed in three periods in 2020-21. By public authorities, we mean NHS Health Trusts, laboratories, and government agencies such as Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care. We searched WhatDoTheyKnow using the terms \\"covid and death\\". We excluded those requests to bodies that cannot provide an answer (e.g. Councils) and those dealing with the effects of vaccines. We grouped questions into themes addressing the definitions and causes of death relevant to the pandemic. We looked at the responses to the questions of the definition of cause of death, the accuracy of the attribution, the role of other pre-existing pathologies and how these were reported and quantified. We found 800 requests from over 90 individuals. There was no consistency in the definition of cause of death or contributory cause of death across national bodies and in different bodies within the same nation. Nursing home providers, as well as medical practitioners, can assign a cause of death according to the Care Quality Commission. Post-mortem examinations were uncommon, the ONS did not incorporate their results in the summary of deaths by cause during the pandemic period. The meaning of the words \\"test\\" or \\"swab\\" was never clarified by any of the respondents. In care homes in England 1,304 out of 17,264 COVID-19 (7.6%, range 0% to 63%) mentioned COVID-19 in the absence of contributory or other factors in the death certificate, making it impossible to ascertain a chain of causality. The inconsistencies already noted hinder the ascertainment of the role of each factor leading to death and the quantification of the importance of infection. Some responses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals or those whose death was not caused by COVID-19 were classified as \\"COVID-19 deaths\\". We found 14 different ways of attributing the causes of death mentioned by respondents. The overall lack of consistency has confused the public and likely led to erroneous conclusions. We are unable to separate the effects on deaths of SARS-CoV-2 from those of human interventions. A coherent process based on consistent definitions across the devolved nations is required. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of causation in pandemics a subset of deaths should be verified using autopsies with full medical documentation.","output":"Understanding Definitions and Reporting of Deaths Attributed to COVID-19 in the UK - Evidence from FOI Requests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The resumption of work and production is one of the key issues during the novel coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) post\\\\epidemic phase.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Virus-host interactome and proteomic survey of PMBCs from COVID-19 patients reveal potential virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has made new treatments a goal for the scientific community.

This present study found that BET proteins inhibition did not effectively suppress the progression of HCC using a transgenic HCC mouse model. Mechanistically, the BET proteins inhibitor JQ1 upregulated the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, JQ1 enhanced the expression of Rab8A, which upregulated the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane. This study also showed that JQ1 combined with anti-PD-L1 Ab effectively suppressed HCC progression, and this benefit was obtained by enhancing the activation and cytotoxic capabilities of CD8 T cells. These results revealed the crucial role and regulation of BET proteins inhibition on the expression of PD-L1 in HCC.

Thirty-three (39%) of the 84 mAbs were found to be strain-specific, and 6 (7%) of the 84 mAbs were subtype-specific. Twenty (24%) of the 84 mAbs recognized the common HA epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1), and A3 (H3N2) influenza viruses. Twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common HA epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1) and A3 (H3N2) human influenza viruses, and H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. We found that of the 16 (19%) clones of the 84 mAbs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens, 15 were made using the HA of the seasonal A1 (H1N1) virus and 1 was made using the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray (TMA) showed that 4 of the 84 mAb clones cross-reacted with human tissue (brain and pancreas).

SETTING Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in the Community of Madrid (Spain). PATIENTS All patients admitted to the ICU on the day of the survey. VARIABLES OF INTEREST General aspects of venous thromboembolic prophylaxis and protocols used (risk stratification and ultrasound screening). A descriptive analysis was performed, continuous data being expressed as the mean or median, and categorical data as percentages. RESULTS A total of 234 patients in 18 ICUs were included. Eighteen percent (42/234) received no prophylaxis, and 55% had no contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis. Of the 192 patients receiving prophylaxis, 84% received pharmacological prophylaxis, 14% mechanical prophylaxis and 2% combined prophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin was the only pharmacological prophylaxis used, with a majority use of enoxaparin (17 of 18 ICUs). In patients with mechanical prophylaxis (31/192), antiembolic stockings were the most commonly used option (58%). Pharmacological prophylaxis contraindications were reported in 20% of the patients (46/234), the most frequent cause being thrombocytopenia (28% of the cases). Fifty percent of the ICUs used no specific venous thromboembolic prophylaxis protocol.

Methods: A survey form was developed with the help of mentors, teachers and school children and circulated by snowball sampling method. 183 responses from Indian school children of age group between 12 and 17 years, from different states were received. Results: It was found that there was a significant alteration of sleep habits in these school children during lockdown. Many school children reported that parents showed leniency in the phone habits of school children and their interaction with friends on social media remained higher during lockdown. Despite that, they were missing their friends and wanted to meet them in-person and they felt that not doing so, was causing a reduction in focus on academics and concentration and making them lose interest in general activities and even in hobbies. Sleep quality had reduced in Indian school going students during lockdown and decreased parental control on phones was observed. Conclusion: The deterioration in social life of the subjects needs to be addressed and taken care of by proper planning of social interaction with ensuring physical distancing and other precautions.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020C2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020C2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a dual-demand (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns.

A potential association between rituximab and worse COVID-19 outcomes was raised by case reports and retrospective, declarative studies (with few data on the total number of patients exposed). Objectives: To address differently the issue of the risk of COVID-19 related to RTX and limit biases, we examined the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in all patients receiving intravenous biologic agents at day-hospitals during the pandemic in France. Methods: From 1st September 2019 to 1st January 2021, we analyzed patients with IA prospectively treated with intravenous biologic agents (RTX, abatacept, infliximab or tocilizumab) in 7 clinical centers in France. We obtained the list of patients receiving intravenous biologic agents in each center from the pharmacist of the hospitals. Therefore, all consecutive patients receiving 1 of the 4 drugs at the time of the study were included in each center. Patients with no follow-up after September 2020 were systematically contacted by phone. The occurrence of a severe COVID -19 (i.e. resulting in death, hospitalization or increase in length of hospitalization related to COVID-19) was the primary outcome criteria. Results: In total, 1116 patients receiving intravenous biologic agents were included: 449 with infliximab, 392 RTX, 170 tocilizumab and 105 abatacept. From 1st September 2019, the median follow-up time was 15 months (interquartile range 14-16). In total, 10 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred, 9 treated with RTX and 1 with infliximab (supplementary Table 1). Four deaths occurred in our cohort during follow-up but none was related to COVID-19 (1 patient treated by tocilizumab, 1 by RTX and 2 by infliximab). In univariate analysis, the proportion of severe COVID-19 was significantly higher for patients receiving RTX than other biologic agents (9/392 vs 1/724, p=0.0003, OR [95%CI] 17.0 [2.1-134.6]). To take into account potential confounders, we performed multivariate analysis accounting for baseline parameters that differed between RTX and other biologic groups. RTX remained significantly associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (p=0.019) (Table 1). Conclusion: The present results highly indicate increased risk of severe COVID-19 with RTX.

However, long-term survival is often compromised by deep infiltration of the tumor. Vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy (VHPL) was previously reported to be a feasible surgical approach for organ preservation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional and oncological outcomes of VHPL in patients. METHODS Patients who underwent VHPL type II (total VHPL, which includes the removal of a vertical section of the thyroid cartilage through the anterior commissure to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage) for pyriform sinus cancer with vocal cord fixation at the authors' institute between 1999 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Functional outcomes concerning swallowing and decannulation were evaluated. Successful functional preservation was defined as laryngeal preservation as well as oral realimentation and decannulation within 6 months after surgery. The oncological outcomes were measured by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) with Kaplan-Meier curves and comparisons were performed between the VHPL-treated patients and patients who underwent non-surgical treatment within the same period. RESULTS A total of 23 patients (stage T3, 17 patients; stage T4, 6 patients) whose initial treatment was VHPL type II were studied, and a cohort of 123 patients was selected as the control group. Pedicle and free flap reconstructions were performed on 12 and 11 patients, respectively. Postoperative radiation and chemoradiation was performed on 14 and 3 patients, respectively. Flap failure and pharyngeal fistula were detected in 2 and 5 patients, respectively. Oral realimentation and decannulation within 6 months were achieved in 82.6% (19 patients) and 87.0% (20 patients) of patients, respectively, and the total functional preservation rate of the study cohort at 6 months was similar to that of the control cohort. (78.3% vs. 82.9%, p = 0.28). After a median follow-up period of 49 months, 9 recurrences and 8 deaths had occurred in the study cohort. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the study cohort had superior DFS (5-year DFS 60.3% vs. 44.6%, p = 0.04) and similar OS (5-year OS 63.8% vs 57.0% p = 0.28) compared with those in the control group.

We hypothesize that vitamin D status may influence the severity of responses to Covid-19 and that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe will be closely aligned to Covid-19 mortality. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed (no language restriction) of vitamin D status (for older adults) in countries/areas of Europe affected by Covid-19 infection. Countries were selected by severity of infection (high and low) and were limited to national surveys or where not available, to geographic areas within the country affected by infection. Covid-19 infection and mortality data was gathered from the World Health Organisation. Results Counter-intuitively, lower latitude and typically 'sunny' countries such as Spain and Italy (particularly Northern Italy), had low mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and high rates of vitamin D deficiency. These countries have also been experiencing the highest infection and death rates in Europe. The northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden) which receive less UVB sunlight than Southern Europe, actually had much higher mean 25(OH)D concentrations, low levels of deficiency and for Norway and Finland, lower infection and death rates. The correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and mortality rate reached conventional significance (P=0.046) by Spearman's Rank Correlation. Conclusions Optimising vitamin D status to recommendations by national and international public health agencies will certainly have benefits for bone health and potential benefits for Covid-19.

Although the recognition that people experience a multitude of crossmodal correspondences between stimuli in the auditory and chemical senses originally emerged from the psychophysics laboratory, the last decade has seen an explosion of interest in the use and application of sonic seasoning research findings, in a range of multisensory experiential events and online offerings. These marketing-led activations have included a variety of different approaches, from curating pre-composed music selections that have the appropriate sonic qualities (such as pitch or timbre), to the composition of bespoke music/soundscapes that match the specific taste/flavour of particular food or beverage products. Moreover, given that our experience of flavour often changes over time and frequently contains multiple distinct elements, there is also scope to more closely match the sonic seasoning to the temporal evolution of the various components (or notes) of the flavour experience. We review a number of case studies of the use of sonic seasoning, highlighting some of the challenges and opportunities associated with the various approaches, and consider the intriguing interplay between physical and digital (online) experiences.

This method is based on deep learning, a recent development of machine learning techniques, which learns the desired mapping function from training data and generalizes to unseen test data. Furthermore, ensemble learning is utilized to estimate the uncertainty originating from trainable parameters of the network and to improve the robustness of the whole model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulation studies, in comparison with curve fitting, investigate extensive conditions and show its universal applicability.

Virion-laden aerosols and droplets target different anatomical sites for deposition. Compared to droplets, aerosols more readily advance into the peripheral lung.

By taking different anatomical aerosol origins into consideration and reflecting aerosols from exhalation maneuvers breathing and vocalization, the physicochemical properties of generated respiratory aerosol particles were defined upon conversion to droplet nuclei by evaporation at ambient air. To provide detailed, spatially-resolved information on particle deposition in the thoracic region of the lung, a top-down refinement approach was employed. Our study presents evidence for hot spots of aerosol deposition in lung generations beyond the terminal bronchiole, with a maximum in the secondary pulmonary lobules and a high preference to the lower lobes of both lungs. In vivo, initial chest CT anomalies, the ground glass opacities, resulting from partial alveolar filling and interstitial thickening in the secondary pulmonary lobules, are likewise localized in these lung generations, with the highest frequency in both lower lobes and in the early stage of disease. Hence, our results suggest a disease initiation right there upon inhalation of virion-laden respiratory aerosols, linking the aerosol transmission route to pathogenesis associated with higher disease burden and identifying aerosol transmission as a new independent risk factor for developing a pulmonary phase with a severe outcome.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Laden Respiratory Aerosol Deposition in the Lung Alveolar-Interstitial Region Is a Potential Risk Factor for Severe Disease: A Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus triggered a global health crisis disproportionately impacting people with pre-existing health conditions and particular demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.

We describe the rapid deployment of remotely delivered mind-body services to people with cancer during COVID-19, rates of participation, and acceptability from patients perspectives. METHODS: Eligible participants were patients with cancer age  18 years enrolled in a single academic cancer centers online patient portal. Interventions included mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Sessions were 30C45 min and led by an integrative medicine clinician. Following each session, participants were asked to complete a three-item questionnaire assessing (1) satisfaction with the class session, (2) reduction in stress/anxiety, and (3) likelihood of recommending the class to others. Patients could also provide comments in real-time using the Zoom chat function. RESULTS: Among 5948 unique visits, the most frequently attended classes were fitness (n = 2513, 42.2%) followed by meditation (n = 1176, 19.8%) and yoga (n = 909, 15.3%). Of these visits, 3902 (65.6%) had an associated completed questionnaire. Across class types, a large majority of participants reported being extremely satisfied (n = 3733, 95.7%), experiencing extreme reductions in anxiety/stress (n = 3268, 83.8%), and being extremely likely to recommend the class to others (n = 3605, 92.4%).

In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 C or at 37 C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0106- 5.5107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity.

In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments.

Objective: To assess the incidence and severity of COVID-19 among HM inpatients. Design: We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health charts of inpatients at Hospital Municipal S?o Jos (HMSJ) in Joinville, Brazil. Setting: This one-year period was selected considering that the first COVID-19 case in Joinville was reported on March 13. Local transmission was initially uncommon. Patients or Other Participants: Diagnosis of HM under the WHO classification and hospital stay for more than 48 hours were required. One hundred seventeen consecutive HM inpatients and 152 consecutive inpatients in the one-year period before COVID-19 in Joinville were included. Intervention: No intervention was performed. Main Outcome Measures: Mortality and incidence of COVID-19, severe disease, and thrombotic events. Results: COVID-19 cumulative incidence for HM inpatients was 25%, with one COVID-19 positive test every 73 patient hospital days. Very likely nosocomial transmission was seen in 19 cases (66%). Chemotherapy was administered within 30 days of symptom onset in 19 patients (66%). Severe neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia were seen in 10 (34%) and 13 (45%) patients, respectively. For HM inpatients with and without COVID-19, the most common diagnoses were acute leukemia (34% and 23%, respectively; p=0.23), lymphoma (28% and 34%; p=0.65), and multiple myeloma (10% and 18%; p=0.4) Severe COVID-19 was established in 22 patients (76%), with 16 (55%) intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 19 deaths (66%). TEs were reported in six patients. Thrombocytopenia prevented anticoagulation in 11 patients (50%). In-hospital mortality was 66% for HM inpatients versus 32% for HM inpatients without COVID-19 (p=0.002) and 23% for pre-COVID-19 HM inpatients (p<0.001). Conclusions: Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in HM inpatients and the higher mortality over this one-year period are very alarming. As vaccination efforts are currently in expansion worldwide, it is uncertain whether hospital care for HM will carry on without inpatient transmission.

Dysregulation of IL-22 production has also frequently been observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have previously described that human CD28, a crucial co-stimulatory receptor necessary for full T cell activation, is also able to act as a TCR independent signaling receptor and to induce the expression of IL-17A and inflammatory cytokines related to Th17 cells, which together with Th22 cells represent the main cellular source of IL-22. Here we characterized the role of CD28 autonomous signaling in regulating IL-22 expression in human CD4(+) T cells. We show that CD28 stimulation in the absence of TCR strongly up-regulates IL-22 gene expression and secretion. As recently observed for IL-17A, we also found that CD28-mediated regulation of IL-22 transcription requires the cooperative activities of both IL-6-activated STAT3 and RelA/NF-B transcription factors. CD28-mediated IL-22 production also promotes the barrier functions of epithelial cells by inducing mucin and metalloproteases expression.

Its etiology is multifactorial and includes poor dietary habits, such as hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diets (HFDs), physical inactivity, and genetic factors. Regular exercise is, per se, a tool for the treatment and prevention of obesity, and recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of exercise can be potentiated by the fasting state, thus potentially promoting additional effects. Despite the significant number of studies showing results that corroborate such hypothesis, very few have evaluated the effects of fasted-state exercise in overweight/obese populations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subacute effects (12 h after conclusion) of a single moderate-intensity exercise bout, performed in either a fed or an 8 h fasted state, on serum profile, substrate-content and heat shock pathwayCrelated muscle protein immunocontent in obese male rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats received a modified high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. The animals were allocated to four groups: fed rest (FER), fed exercise (FEE), fasted rest (FAR) and fasted exercise (FAE). The exercise protocol was a 30 min session on a treadmill, with an intensity of 60% of VO(2)max. The duration of the fasting period was 8 h prior to the exercise session. After a 12 h recovery, the animals were killed and metabolic parameters of blood, liver, heart, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated, as well as SIRT1 and HSP70 immunocontent in the muscles. Results: HFD induced obesity and insulin resistance. Soleus glycogen concentration decreased in the fasted groups and hepatic glycogen decreased in the fed exercise group. The combination of exercise and fasting promoted a decreased concentration of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. In the heart, combination fasting plus exercise was able to decrease triglycerides to control levels. In the soleus muscle, both fasting and fasting plus exercise were able to decrease triglyceride concentrations. In addition, heat shock protein 70 and sirtuin 1 immunocontent increased after exercise in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Conclusions: An acute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise, when realized in fasting, may induce, in obese rats with metabolic dysfunctions, beneficial adaptations to their health, such as better biochemical and molecular adaptations that last for at least 12 h. Considering the fact that overweight/obese populations present an increased risk of cardiovascular events/diseases, significant reductions in such plasma markers of lipid metabolism are an important achievement for these populations.","output":"Metabolic and Molecular Subacute Effects of a Single Moderate-Intensity Exercise Bout, Performed in the Fasted State, in Obese Male Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is a surge in epidemiological modeling research due to sudden onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the globe.

The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the mortality rate at 1 month after surgery in symptomatic COVID-positive patients with that of asymptomatic patients. A secondary endpoint of the study is to evaluate, in the two groups of patients, mortality at 1 month on the basis of type of fracture and type of surgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective multicentre study, we reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalised for proximal femur fracture at 14 hospitals in Northern Italy. Two groups were formed: COVID-19-positive patients (C+ group) presented symptoms, had a positive swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and received treatment for COVID-19; COVID-19-negative patients (C- group) were asymptomatic and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The two groups were compared for differences in time to surgery, survival rate and complications rate. The follow-up period was 1 month. RESULTS: Of the 1390 patients admitted for acute care for any reason, 477 had a proximal femur fracture; 53 were C+ but only 12/53 were diagnosed as such at admission. The mean age was > 80 years, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 3 in both groups. There was no substantial difference in time to surgery (on average, 2.3 days for the C+ group and 2.8 for the C- group). As expected, a higher mortality rate was recorded for the C+ group but not associated with the type of hip fracture or treatment. No correlation was found between early treatment (< 48 h to surgery) and better outcome in the C+ group. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture in COVID-19-positive patients accounted for 11% of the total. On average, the time to surgery was > 48 h, which reflects the difficulty of maintaining normal workflow during a medical emergency such as the present pandemic and notwithstanding the suspension of non-urgent procedures. Hip fracture was associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19-positive patients than in COVID-19-negative patients. This fact should be considered when communicating with patients and/or their family. Our data suggest no substantial difference in hip fracture management between patients with or without COVID-19 infection. In this sample, the COVID-19-positive patients were generally asymptomatic at admission; therefore, routine screening is recommended.

Endothelial cells participate in the formation of blood vessels and play an important role in the whole process of wound healing. Recent studies suggested that exosomes contribute to the intercellular communication through paracrine pathways, and sustained release of exosomes from hydrogel-based materials provide a promising strategy for curing wound defects. In this study, we isolated exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that HUVECs derived exosomes (HUVECs-Exos) could promote the proliferation and migration activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are two important effector cells for skin regeneration. Then we developed gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel as the wound dressing to incorporate HUVECs-Exos and applied it to the full-thickness cutaneous wounds. It demonstrated that GelMA scaffold could not only repair the wound defect, but also achieve sustained release of exosomes. The in vivo results showed accelerated re-epithelialization, promotion of collagen maturity and improvement of angiogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggested that HUVECs-Exos could accelerate wound healing and GelMA mediated controlled release of HUVECs-Exos might offer a new method for repairing cutaneous wound defects.","output":"GelMA combined with sustained release of HUVECs derived exosomes for promoting cutaneous wound healing and facilitating skin regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant. Methods: By May 15, 2021, 238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70C79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0C69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1C19, 2021. Findings: The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1C6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70C79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0C69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70C79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1C4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15C19, respectively. Interpretation: Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19.

Clinical factors associated with severity of the disease remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize Polish patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to evaluate potential prognostic factors of severe course of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the Pulmonology and Allergology Department of the University Hospital in Krakw, Poland. Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Multivariable analysis revealed age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.01-1.15), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53), modified early warning score (MEWS; OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.48-12), the highest d-dimer value (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3) to be associated with severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION This observational study showed that almost half of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 developed respiratory failure in the course of the disease.

Frailty has been proposed for risk stratification in COVID-19 with limited evidence. Cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, diabetes and raised BMI have been associated with increased COVID-19 risk. We sought to test if non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk had reduced COVID-19, to inform targeted shielding policies. METHODS: Fried and Rockwood frailty were ascertained at UK Biobank baseline (2006-2010) and electronic frailty index(eFI) in primary care data to 2017*. A cardiovascular disease risk score(CRS) consisting of smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose and physical activity was estimated at baseline. Frailty (baseline and eFI; eFI alone) and CRS were tested in logistic models against COVID-19 status and COVID-19 mortality to 14th June 2020 adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. RESULTS: N=269,164 UKB participants aged 65 at baseline (75years in 2020). 13.9% of COVID-19 positive were non-frail with low baseline CRS versus 41.8% frail with moderate/high CRS. Being non-frail and having low CRS were independently associated with reduced COVID-19. The composite of non-frail with low CRS compared to frail with moderate/high CRS had significantly reduced COVID-19 risk (composite non-frail with low CRS HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.84; p=0.0023; eFI non-frail with low CRS HR 0.16; 95%CI 0.07-0.36; p value=9.9x10-6) and COVID-19 mortality (composite non-frail HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10-0.82; pvalue=0.02; eFI non-frail 0.07; 95% CI 0.02-0.28; pvalue=0.00014). CONCLUSION: These results show that the COVID-19 risk in non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk was up to 84% lower than in those who were frail with cardiovascular risk factors. This could contribute to future work on stratification of shielding risk in older adults in future COVID-19 surges. *Planned data updates prior to the conference should enable updates to 2020.","output":"12 Being Non-Frail and Free From Cardiovascular Disease Reduces COVID-19 Risk in 269,164 Older UK Biobank Participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vocal cord paralysis is a rare but severe complication after orotracheal intubation.

Cardiac complications can occur in patients with COVID-19 and can be fatal in severe cases. Recently, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 used the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor to gain entry into the host cell. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect heart tissues and the potential mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 have not been determined. Methods To investigate the expression of ACE2 in heart tissues, we performed a bioinformatic analysis from public databases involving mRNA and protein expression. The correlation between ACE2 expression and virus-related genes was analyzed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed to explore the roles of ACE2. Results ACE2 expression in the heart was significantly higher than that in the lung. Compared with the other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 was increased in the heart. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ACE2 was substantially upregulated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Importantly, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with genes that regulate viral reproduction and transmission. The GO and PPI analyses showed that the functions of proteins interacting with ACE2 were significantly enriched in the regulation of the viral process and inflammatory response. Conclusions Our study provided bioinformatics evidence that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to COVID-19-mediated myocardial damage via the virus-induced cytopathic effect, triggering a cardiac inflammatory storm.

Currently, more information is needed for further understanding the transmission, clinical characteristics, and infection control procedures of 2019-nCOV. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCOV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations about other high infectious human COVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide helpful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, mechanisms of human CoVs infection, and infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCOV is discussed. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of ocular surface and upper respiratory tract is connected by nasolacrimal duct and share same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses. The eye is rarely involved in human CoVs infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV infection, and COV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV infection is also very low, which imply that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human COVs infection, nor is a preferred gateway of entry for human COVs to infect respiratory tract. However, pathogens exposed to the ocular surface might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through lacrimal duct, and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice which are apt to transmit human COVs by droplets and fomites, hand hygiene and personal protection are still highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","output":"Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are no commercially available effective antiviral medications or vaccines to deal with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Severe COVID-19 is characterised in part by vascular thrombosis and cytokine storms due to increased plasma concentrations of factors secreted from endothelial and T-cells. Here, using patient data recorded in the UK Biobank, we demonstrate the importance of variations in Rab46 (CRACR2A) and clinical outcomes. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene EFCAB4B cause missense variations in Rab46, which are associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All three SNPs cause changes in amino acid residues that are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in protein structure and function. Two SNPs, rs17836273 (A98T) and rs36030417 (H212Q), cause amino acid changes in important functional domains: the EF-hand and coiled-coil domain respectively. By using molecular modelling, we suggest that the substitution of threonine at position 98 causes structural changes in the EF-hand calcium binding domain. Rab46 is a Rab GTPase that plays regulates both regulating endothelial cell secretion and T-cell cytokine signalling and this study supports the hypothesis that genetic variations in Rab46 plays a role in COVID-19 severity.","output":"EFCAB4B (CRACR2A) genetic variants associated with COVID-19 fatality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020, and has caused more than 600,000 deaths in the United States at the time of this report. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients have a higher risk of mortality with COVID-19 owing to profound immune dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients. This single-center prospective study included all (n = 58) adult HCT/CAR-T recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the University of Kansas Medical Center between March 2020 and May 2021. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were ascertained from medical records. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Bivariate analyses, using the chi-square and t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study included 58 HCT/CAR-T patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, including recipients of allogeneic HCT (n = 32), autologous HCT (n = 23), and CAR-T therapy (n = 3). The median patient age was 58 years (range, 24 to 77 years), and 64% were males. The median time from HCT/CAR-T therapy to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 17.7 months (range, 0.2 to 201.9 months), and 22% of the patients acquired SARS-CoV-2 within the first 100 days post-HCT/CAR-T therapy. The primary hematologic disorders were plasma cell (36%), myeloid (38%), and lymphoid (26%) malignancies. Myeloablative conditioning was performed in 62% of patients. Donors were autologous (45%), matched sibling (15%), matched unrelated (21%), and haploidentical (19%). Prior history of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), active GVHD, and current immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was noted in 22%, 31%, and 36% of patients, respectively. Concurrent infections were observed in 19%. Lymphopenia (P = .049) and high serum ferritin concentration (P = .020) were associated with mortality. COVID-19 severity was mild in 50% of the patients, moderate in 22%, and severe in 28%. Clinical findings included pneumonia or abnormal chest imaging (in 50%), hypoxia (28%), intensive care unit admission (19%), and mechanical ventilation (10%). Therapies included remdesivir (in 41%), convalescent plasma (35%), dexamethasone (22%), monoclonal antibodies (19%), and tocilizumab (3%). The median duration of viral shedding (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR) was 7.7 weeks (range, 2 to 18.7 weeks), and 2 patients had a persistent infection for >5 months post-CAR-T therapy. After a median follow-up of 6.1 months (range, 0.5-13.6 months), the mortality rate was 16% in all patients and 28% in allogeneic HCT recipients. Among 9 patients who died, the median survival after SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23 days (range, 14 to 140 days). In survivors with moderate-severe COVID-19, the median time to recovery was 4.2 weeks (range, 1.1 to 24.7 weeks). Among allogeneic HCT recipients, 5 (16%) developed subsequent pulmonary chronic GVHD necessitating systemic steroids and additional IST. Significant predictors of COVID-19 severity included allogeneic HCT (odds ratio [OR], 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 10.8; P = .020), history of grade II-IV acute GVHD (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.10 to 18.86; P = .036) and concurrent IST (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 19.8; P = .004). HCT and CAR-T cell therapy recipients are at an increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and higher mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings confirm the need for continuing vigilance with social distancing and masks, vaccination prioritization, close monitoring, and aggressive treatment of HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection has produced a pandemic with serious consequences for our health care system.

Little is known about the informed consent process for ECMO or clinician viewpoints on ethical complexities related to ECMO in practice. METHODS We sent a cross-sectional survey to all departments providing ECMO within 7 United States hospitals in January 2021. One clinician from each department completed the 42-item survey representing their department. RESULTS Fourteen departments within 7 hospitals responded (response rate 78%, N = 14/18). The mean time spent consenting patients or surrogate decision-makers for ECMO varied, from 7.5 minutes (95% CI 5-10) for unstable patients to 20 minutes (95% CI 15-30) for stable patients (p = 0.0001). Few clinician respondents (29%) report patients or surrogate decision-makers always possess informed consent for ECMO. Most departments (92%) have absolute exclusion criteria for ECMO such as older age (43%, cutoffs ranging from 60-75 years), active malignancy (36%), and elevated body mass index (29%). A significant minority of departments (29%) do not always offer the option to withdraw ECMO to patients or surrogate decision-makers. For patients who cannot be liberated from ECMO and are ineligible for heart or lung transplant, 36% of departments would recommend the patient be removed from ECMO and 64% would continue ECMO support. CONCLUSION Adequate informed consent for ECMO is a major ethical challenge, and the content of these discussions varies. Use of categorical exclusion criteria and withdrawal of ECMO if a patient cannot be liberated from it differ among departments and institutions.","output":"Clinician Ethical Perspectives on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) causes stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance as well as common physical health problems This study aimed to determine the effect of stress perceived by adults due to the COVID-19 pandemic on their sleep quality Materials and Methods: Using the snowball sampling method for sample selection, 1 909 individuals aged 18-65 years living in Turkey who agreed to participate in the research, were knowledgeable about the use of social media and were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders were included in this descriptive study Data collection forms were uploaded online and published via Google Forms The survey was conducted between 30 April and 10 May 2020 Sociodemographic information form, Perceived Stress scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) were used as data collection tools Results: The participants scored 15 585 16 points in the perceived insufficient Self-Efficacy subscale, 15 205 41 in the perceived stress/distress subscale and 30 788 85 in the total PSS The PSQI score was 7 783 46, and 71 6% of the participants had poor sleep quality A significant, positive and weak relationship was found between the total scores on PSQI and PSS (p&lt;0 05) Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that adults had higher perceived stress and poor sleep quality and their sleep quality decreases as the perceived stress increases during the COVID-19 pandemic Ama?: Koronavirs hastal-2019 (COVID-19), yayg?n fiziksel sa?l?k problemlerinin yan? s?ra bireyde stres, anksiyete, depresyon ve uyku bozuklu?una neden olmaktad?r ?alma, yeti?kinlerin COVID-19 salg?n? nedeniyle alg?lad?klar? stresin uyku kalitelerine etkisini belirlemek amac?yla yap?ld?

It is seen 1 out of 100,000 live births and makes up less than 1% of all chest wall deformities, seen more often among females. The deformity can be partial or complete. Partial deformities can be superior or inferior. It is generally diagnosed at birth when paradoxical respiratory movements are seen. Patients are often asymptomatic when they are born and generally other abnormalities accompany. As sternal clefts can be repaired primarily at early ages, they are repaired using autologous or synthetic grafts in the following years. We present a 2-month-old girl with superior partial sternal cleft repaired primary and accompanying hemangiomas in this case report. CASE PRESENTATION: A girl who was born in another center and had a sternal cleft, who did not have any problems in the early period, was admitted to our hospital with respiratory distress at the age of 43 days. The patient was monitored with mechanical ventilator support, and there were hemangiomas around his left ear and lips. There were paradoxical respiratory movements in front of the heart, in the upper midline of the chest. Three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the upper part of the sternum did not develop, and there were hypoplasic sternal bars on both sides. It was evaluated as superior partial sternal cleft, and surgery was planned. In the operation, the sternal bars were released from the pericardium and pleura. The periosteum in the medial of both sternal bars was then released and connected in the midline, in front of the pericardium. CONCLUSION: Although neonates with a sternal cleft are asymptomatic at birth, respiratory symptoms may develop in later periods. In addition, because the structures are more flexible in the neonatal period, the primary repair of the cleft is easier and the risk of cardiac compression is lower. In our case, sternal bars could be approached primary, and no chondral grafts, patches, or steel wires were required.","output":"Primary closure of superior partial sternal cleft in a 2-month-old girl: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here.

The rules that govern practice are often based on the institutional precedent and assumptions of staff, and may have little or no evidence to support them. Policy and practice related to visiting hours is of pressing concern in Canada, and in Ontario specifically, following the reaction to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and subsequent changes in visiting policies in most health care settings. A systematic investigation of the impact of hospital visiting hours on visitors (including patients, families, and significant others) would inform decision-makers who are responsible for hospital policies about the best available evidence. OBJECTIVES The objective of this review was to appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the impact of hospital visiting hours on patients and their visitors. INCLUSION CRITERIA Types of participants This review considered studies that included both pediatric and adult hospital patients and their visitors. Participants were either patients, visitors, or health care providers in the following hospital settings: medical/surgical units, critical care (ICU, CCU, NICU), pediatrics, maternity, or general hospital wards.Articles were excluded if participants came from the following settings: post-operative and post-anaesthesia care units (PACU), dementia wards, long-term care settings or retirement homes, or delivery rooms. PACUs were excluded because there are aspects of the presence of visitors to these units that are very specific, and differ from the general visits to patients who are not in the immediate post-operative stage. Dementia wards, long-term care settings and retirement homes were excluded because these were considered to be their \\"home\\", so visiting would be quite different from that on acute care hospital wards. Finally, delivery rooms were excluded because this review does not evaluate the impact of the outcomes of presence during \\"delivery\\" (or other \\"procedures\\").Types of interventions Studies were considered for inclusion in this review if they evaluated the effect or impact of visiting policies. This included interventions targeted at limiting or expanding patient visiting. We anticipated a paucity of experimental studies regarding this review question, thus included observational studies where the impact of visiting policy on patients and/or visitors was a focus, but testing intervention(s) may not have been the primary aim. We did not consider observational studies that focused only on the presence of visitors during specific procedures, resuscitation, or childbirth. The reason is that this limited aspect of the presence of a significant other was not considered \\"visiting\\" per se, and would be best examined in another systematic review.Types of outcome measures For this review, outcome measures related to both patients and visitors as a result of visiting hour policies were considered, including but not limited to: patient and/or visitor satisfaction; attitudes; beliefs; perceptions; mood; or patient physiological outcomes. These also included health care provider beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes about the impact of visiting policies on patients and/or visitors. Studies were excluded if they examined the trend of current visiting hour policies (with no evaluation of their impact), or if they focused on visitor presence only during emergency procedures, resuscitation, or childbirth.Types of studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies were included. However, given the expected scarcity of these designs relevant to our review question, other quantitative research designs were considered, such as non-randomized controlled trials, before-and-after studies, and descriptive/observational studies. SEARCH STRATEGY Using a defined search and retrieval method the following databases from 1995-2007 were accessed: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, HealthSTAR, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, AMED, and ERIC. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Each paper was assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments for evidence of effectiveness, from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were dealt with by consultations with a third reviewer. DATA COLLECTION Information was extracted from each paper independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were dealt with by consultations with a third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS Due to type of designs and quality of available studies, it was not possible to pool quantitative research study results in a statistical meta-analysis. Since statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in a descriptive narrative form. RESULTS Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The study designs were varied, and included one pilot randomized trial, two quasi-experimental studies, eight descriptive studies/cross-sectional surveys, and four pre-post intervention questionnaires. Findings were inconsistent across studies. Nurses inconsistently enforced visiting policies. In ICU settings, liberalized visiting hours did not increase septic complications. One study reinforced the need for increased patient control over visiting (individual visit contracts, devices). Flexible (open) visitation policies increased patient and visitor satisfaction, and sibling visitation was beneficial to the patient and family. In maternity settings, a 'combination policy' was useful (open visiting for partner, more restricted visiting for others). CONCLUSION Key recommendations are provided that refer to clinical practice in critical care, maternity, and general ward settings, as well as recommendations for future research. In critical care settings, policy makers/administrators need to be aware of their staff nurses' beliefs and attitudes about visiting policies, educate them about the rationale for these policies and consider program development to assist nurses to work with families. Open visitation, and ways to increase patient control of visiting should be considered. No connection was found between liberal visiting hours and increased infection rates. When facilitating sibling visitation in the NICU, a pre-visit education process is recommended. Maternity settings may wish to consider a 'combination' policy, where the women's partners and/or significant other would have open visiting (all day), with restricted visiting for others. In other general hospital ward settings, open visiting with a 'quiet hour' is suggested.","output":"The Impact of Hospital Visiting Hour Policies on Pediatric and Adult Patients and their Visitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Schools are a key setting for childhood obesity interventions, yet nurses are not often included in delivering these interventions.

In this study, we explored via in silico approaches myxobacterial secondary metabolites against various receptor-binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike which are responsible in recognition and attachment to host cell receptors mechanisms, namely ACE2, GRP78, and NRP1. In general, cyclic depsipeptide chondramides conferred high affinities toward the spike RBD, showing strong binding to the known viral hot spots Arg403, Gln493 and Gln498 and better selectivity compared to most host cell receptors studied. Among them, chondramide C3 (1) exhibited a binding energy which remained relatively constant when docked against most of the spike variants. Chondramide C (2) on the other hand exhibited strong affinity against spike variants identified in the United Kingdom (N501Y), South Africa (N501Y, E484K, K417N) and Brazil (N501Y, E484K, K417T). Chondramide C6 (9) showed highest BE towards GRP78 RBD. Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed for chondramides 1 and 2 against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD of the Wuhan wild-type and the South African variant, respectively, where resulting complexes demonstrated dynamic stability within a 120-ns simulation time. Protein-protein binding experiments using HADDOCK illustrated weaker binding affinity for complexed chondramide ligands in the RBD against the studied host cell receptors.

This dynamic stifles effective information sharing, while the need for prompt and accurate evidence-based decision making has become crucial. Crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, elevate the importance of quality decision making and exacerbate issues associated with the lack of a cohesive system to share information. Competitive intelligence (CI) is a discipline that encourages gathering, analyzing, and sharing information throughout a firm in order to develop and sustain competitive advantage. CI could be considered a precursor in establishing a learning organization (LO). Although CI research has focused on its process and value, little is found in the literature on how to integrate CI into an organization; this is particularly true in healthcare. A conceptual model is proposed to build and integrate a CI function and culture within a healthcare organization to encourage effective information sharing and knowledge development. In turn, this can provide a mechanism to create a learning health system (LHS). Although the model was developed specifically for US healthcare, it offers application to healthcare in other countries as well as most any industry.","output":"Competitive intelligence: A precursor to a learning health system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The coronavirus pandemic caused changes in different social segments.

Our aim was to assess and compare Healthcare Worker (HCW) mental well-being in 2021 against a previously published cohort in 2020. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: HCWs from 4 public hospitals and a primary health care system over a 4-week duration in 2021 coinciding with a major surge compared with a similar period in 2020. METHODS: A survey comprising of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was distributed via email. Primary endpoints were the proportion meeting OLBI thresholds for both disengagement and exhaustion and being at risk for both Anxiety and Depression using HADS. Multivariate analysis identified significant predictors among demographic, workplace, and SAQ data. Subgroup analysis of overseas HCWs was performed. RESULTS: We surveyed 1475 HCWs. Significantly more HCWs met primary outcomes using OLBI and HADS than in 2020 (84.1% and 39.6% vs 68.2% and 23.3%, respectively; P < .001). Burnout levels were uniformly high. A HADS score 8 in either subscale was significantly associated with meeting burnout thresholds (P < .001). Overseas HCWs (P = .002), South Asian ethnicity (P = .004), preuniversity educational qualifications (P = .026), and longer shift workhours of 8 to <12 (P = .015) and 12 (P = .001) were significantly associated with meeting HADS thresholds.

This study aimed to monitor cerebral rSO2 using NIRS in encephalopathic neonates aiming to maintain the rSO2 between 55 to 85%, in the first 72 hours of admission in order to improve short-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study enrolling encephalopathic neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and non-HIE etiologies into 8 clinical categories. Monitoring and targeting the cerebral rSO2 between 55 to 85% employing predefined actions and management alterations was done over 72 hours. The neurodevelopmental assessment was conducted at 3, 6 and 9-12 months corrected age. Motor and mental developmental quotients (MoDQ) (MeDQ) were recorded and compared to historical control. RESULTS: A total of 120 neonates were enrolled and assessed for NDO. The MoDQ (mean  SD) was 92.55  14.85, 93.80  13.20, 91.02  12.69 and MeDQ (mean  SD) was 91.80  12.98, 91.80  13.69, 88.41  11.60 at 3, 6 and 9-12 months. The MoDQ and MeDQ scores of the historic cohort at 12 months were 86.35  20.34 and 86.58  18.27. The mean difference [MD (95%CI)] for MoDQ was - 4.670 (- 8.48 to - 0.85) (p=0.0165) and for MeDQ was - 1.83 (- 5.26 to 1.6) (p=0.29). There was a negative correlation between the composite developmental quotient (CoDQ) with mean rSO2 and a positive correlation with cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (CFTOE). Neonates with HIE and neonatal encephalopathy (NE) (n=37/120) had the lowest motor and mental DQ on neurodevelopmental assessment. Clinical categories neonatal meningitis (NM) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) showed improvement in DQ scores over the study period.

An analysis of the data shows principals have experienced increased levels of stress and anxiety since the pandemic began. The principals describe managing this increased stress and anxiety in two prominent ways: (1) suppressing much of this stress and anxiety in an effort to put on a brave face for students, teachers, parents, and the community;and (2) relying on activities and individuals outside of their school (family members/other principals in the district) as outlets to help manage their stress and anxiety.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at Songklanagarind Hospital, Thailand. The data were collected from January 1, 2020, to August 31, 2021. The results of laboratory investigations, consisting of a complete blood count (CBC), including hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count; chest X-ray (CXR); electrocardiography (EKG); and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV), were evaluated and analyzed. Additional management actions and rates of postponement or cancellation of surgeries were also evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 401 participants were enrolled in this study. The rates of abnormal investigation results were 40.2% for EKG, 15.5% for CXR, 12.7% for Hb, 11.7% for Hct, 2.0% for platelet count, and 0.2% for anti-HIV.

However, SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, with each new variant potentially affecting widely-used nucleic acid amplification diagnostic tests. RT-LAMP has been adopted as a quick, inexpensive diagnostic alternative to RT-qPCR, but as a newer method, has not been studied as thoroughly. Here we interrogate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 sequence mutations on RT-LAMP amplification, creating 523 single point mutation variants covering every position of the LAMP primers in 3 SARS-CoV-2 assays and analyzing their effects with over 4,500 RT-LAMP reactions. Remarkably, we observed only minimal effects on amplification speed and no effect on detection sensitivity at positions equivalent to those that significantly impact RT-qPCR assays. We also created primer sets targeting a specific short deletion and observed that LAMP is able to amplify even with a primer containing multiple consecutive mismatched bases, albeit with reduced speed and sensitivity. This highlights RT-LAMP as a robust technique for viral RNA detection that can tolerate most mutations in the primer regions. Additionally, where variant discrimination is desired, we describe the use of molecular beacons to sensitively distinguish and identify variant RNA sequences carrying short deletions. Together these data add to the growing body of knowledge on the utility of RT-LAMP and increase its potential to further our ability to conduct molecular diagnostic tests outside of the traditional clinical laboratory environment.","output":"Profiling RT-LAMP tolerance of sequence variation for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This The number of applications for a humanoid robot is at an all-time high, and one such area where humanoid robots could be used is the hospital sector.

Accordingly, universal testing has been suggested as a potential strategy for reducing transmission in the obstetrical setting. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy at a designated COVID-19 hospitalization centre in Montral, Qubec. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort was constructed to include all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 22 and July 31, 2020, and received care at the Jewish General Hospital. Initially, testing was restricted to at-risk patients, identified through the use of a screening questionnaire. Beginning on May 15, 2020, universal testing was implemented, and all pregnant patients admitted to the hospital were tested. Data were collected through chart review. RESULTS: Of 803 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, 41 (5%) tested positive. Among those patients who were symptomatic, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (53%), fever (37%), dyspnea (30%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20%). Before the implementation of universal testing, 13% (three of 24) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. After implementation of universal testing, 80% (eight of 10) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID-19. Particularly in endemic areas, universal testing of pregnant patients presenting to the hospital should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent in-hospital and community transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Screening and Testing Pregnant Patients for SARS-CoV-2: First-Wave Experience of a Designated COVID-19 Hospitalization Centre in Montreal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore the challenges experienced by ICU nurses throughout the provision of care for COVID\\\\19 patients.

Objectives: To examine subjective and objective sleep quality in young women with PTSD following sexual assault compared with a control group at baseline and after one year of treatment. Methods: Seventy-four women with PTSD following sexual assault and 64 healthy controls with no history of sexual assault were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Subjects also underwent full in-lab polysomnography. PTSD participants received pharmacological and/or psychological therapy between baseline and one-year follow-up. Results: The PTSD group had significantly higher scores in the clinical and sleep measurements than the control group. Although the PTSD group reported poorer subjective sleep quality than healthy controls, there were few between-group differences in objective sleep. Analysis of the PTSD group at baseline and one-year follow-up showed that the PSQI global score was a significant predictor of PTSD improvement.

We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies. METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and taking controls as recovered COVID 19 patients who did not develop mucormycosis. Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors. RESULTS: A total of 352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean of 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases had conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7,95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs. no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM. CONCLUSION: Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.","output":"Novel risk factors for Coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis(CAM): a case-control study during the outbreak in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We investigated the time course of clinical response in the Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study (TEOSS). Methods: TEOSS randomized 119 predominantly outpatient youth ages 8-19 years with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to 8 weeks of treatment with molindone, risperidone, or olanzapine. We used proportional hazards regression to determine whether these three antipsychotics differed in the time until clinical response, defined as the time from treatment initiation to the point of achieving a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score of 1 (\\"very much improved\\") or 2 (\\"much improved\\") that was maintained until week 8. Results: Of the 116 youth who initiated treatment, 56 (48%) achieved clinical response. Among clinical responders, the median (interquartile range) time until clinical response was 4.0 (4.0) weeks for olanzapine, 4.5 (4.0) weeks for risperidone, and 6.0 (4.0) weeks for molindone. There were no significant differences in time course for clinical response between medications (p = 0.84). Youth without symptom improvement (CGI-I &#8805; 4) after 3 weeks were more likely to be clinical nonresponders at week 8 (relative risk ratio = 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.05), compared with youth with at-least-minimal symptom improvement after 3 weeks when looking at all antipsychotics combined. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate medication differences in treatment response timing in early onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Clinical response times for molindone, risperidone, and olanzapine were not significantly different. Furthermore, while lack of early improvement predicted clinical nonresponse, whether or not to continue antipsychotic treatment after 3 or more weeks without symptom improvement should be based on clinical judgment after weighing potential risks, benefits, and alternatives.

Methods : This study evaluated the performance of extraction-free protocols based on simple dilution of the specimen in sterile RNAse free water (with or without a heating step) in comparison to standard RNA extraction protocols, using two commercial kits for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex? SARS-CoV-2 assay and Allplex? SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Results : Compared with conventional protocols, extraction-free protocols based on sample dilution without a heating step exhibited a lower analytical sensitivity: 74% and 82% with the Allplex? SARS-CoV-2 assay (tested with 139 NPS samples) and the Allplex? SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay (tested with 69 NPS samples), with a mean increase of Ct values of +2.04 and +1.32, respectively. Most false negative results were observed with sampled of low viral load. Including a step of heath exposure did not improve but actually decreased the analytical sensitivity of the assay.

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) to conventional multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MPLC). We compared intra-operative complications, operative time, postoperative complications, pain score, readmission rate and conversion to open amongst both groups. METHODS A retrospective review of data of patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between May 2009 and November 2011 was performed. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RESULTS A total of 184 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 76 patients from MPLC were excluded from comparison based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 62 patients in MPLC and 45 patients in the SILC group were compared. The two groups were similar with respect to patients' demographics and American Society of Anaesthesiology grades. The median operative time for SILC was 75 min (range 42-120) compared to 60 min (range 26-117) in MPLC (p = 0.02). There was no conversion to open procedure. One patient in SILC group was converted to MPLC and two patients required a second port insertion. Postoperative pain-score and length of hospital stay were comparable in both groups. One patient in each group had minor bleeding from gall bladder bed controlled with diathermy. CONCLUSION SILC is a safe and feasible approach in selected patients.

Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of silent hypoxemia, happy hypoxemics and atypical ARDS, all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with pulse doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 organising pneumonia: Has there been a widespread failure to identify and treat this prevalent condition in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is in response to the article entitled \\"The process of designing for learning: understanding university teachers' design work\\" (Bennett et al., Educ Tech Res Dev 65:125-145, 2017). Bennett et al.

This exploratory study provides rich, contextualized descriptions about university teachers' design process and pinpoints key design characteristics as top-down, breadth-first, iterative, responsive, and reflective. These key design characteristics revealed by the rich contextual descriptions could provide applicable insights into the design process especially for new instructors. The findings of the study could inform how learning design could be adapted during an emergency remote teaching (ERT) as it is dynamic and open to revision. A noteworthy limitation of the study is that complementary data such as design artifacts could be utilized to ensure data triangulation in addition to self-reported data obtained via interviews. The study found that university instructors' design process did not appear to draw on instructional design models. Therefore, future studies could focus on to what extent and how such models could be used by university instructors.

While this phenomenon is found in many different species, its function is obscure. Understanding the molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes should help define their function. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of molecules whose levels of expression differentiate activated from resting astrocytes and to use the molecular profile of reactive astrocytes as the basis for speculations on the functions of these cells. At present, reactive astrocytosis is defined primarily as an increase in the number and size of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. In vivo, this increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells reflects predominantly phenotypic changes of resident astroglia rather than migration or proliferation of such cells. Upon activation, astrocytes upmodulate the expression of a large number of molecules. From this molecular profile it becomes apparent that reactive astrocytes may benefit the injured nervous system by participating in diverse biological processes. For example, upregulation of proteases and protease inhibitors could help remodel the extracellular matrix, regulate the concentration of different proteins in the neuropil and clear up debris from degenerating cells. Cytokines are key mediators of immunity and inflammation and could play a critical role in the regulation of the blood-central nervous system interface. Neurotrophic factors, transporter molecules and enzymes involved in the metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids or in the antioxidant pathway may help protect neurons and other brain cells by controlling neurotoxin levels and contributing to homeostasis within the central nervous system. Therefore, an impairment of astroglial performance has the potential to exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Based on the synopsis of studies presented, a number of issues become apparent that deserve a more extensive analysis. Among them are the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes to early wound repair, the characterization of astroglial subpopulations, the specificity of the astroglial response in different diseases as well as the analysis of reactive astrocytes with techniques that can resolve fast physiologic processes. Differences between reactive astrocytes in vivo and primary astrocytes in culture are discussed and underline the need for the development and exploitation of models that will allow the analysis of reactive astrocytes in the intact organism.","output":"Molecular profile of reactive astrocytesImplications for their role in neurologic disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The anti-inflammatory master regulator IL-10 is critical to protect the host from tissue damage during acute phases of immune responses.

Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991C2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO(2) emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO(2) emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO(2). Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO(2) at the 50(th) and 75(th) quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25(th) quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors expenditures caused CO(2) emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO(2) emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.

However, much of the work around measuring this construct has been done in high-income geographies, with very little representation from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). To fill this gap, and guide future research in low resource settings, we aim to summarize best evidence measures of collective efficacy for women and girls from LMICs. METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched five databases for English language peer-reviewed literature on measures of collective efficacy, published between 1 January 2009 and 25 August 2020. In addition, we sought expert input for relevant papers in this area. Research staff screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles in a double-blind review. Inclusion criteria were: (i) original quantitative analysis, and (ii) sample limited to women/girls only ( 100), residing in LMICs. RESULTS We identified 786 unique articles, 14 of which met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies captured a diversity of population groups, including pregnant women, recent mothers, adolescent girls, and female sex workers, from across national settings. Two broad constructs of collective efficacy were captured by the measures: (i) group dynamics, and (ii) collective action. All 14 studies included items on group dynamics in their measures, whereas seven studies included items on collective action. Four studies validated new measures of collective efficacy, and seven provided evidence supporting the relationship between collective efficacy and outcomes related to women's well-being. Overall, measures demonstrated good reliability and validity when tested, and those testing for associations or effects found a positive relationship of collective efficacy with women's health behaviors. CONCLUSION The past decade has resulted in a number of new collective efficacy measures demonstrating good validity in terms of their associations with key health outcomes among women and girls from across LMIC settings, but there remains no standard measure in the field. Those that exist focus on group dynamics, but less often on collective action. A standard measure of collective efficacy inclusive of group dynamics and collective action can support better understanding of the value of women's collectives across national settings and populations.","output":"Collective efficacy measures for women and girls in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the shock of school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effect of domestic responsibilities on analysts' attention at work.

The early events of immune recovery of T cells and B cells in severely lymphopenic HIV(+) patients have not been fully characterized. In a cohort of lymphopenic (CD4 T-cell count < 100/L) HIV(+) patients, we studied mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB) and lymph nodes (LN) pre-ART (n = 40) and 6-8 weeks post-ART (n = 30) with evaluation of cellular immunophenotypes; histology on LN sections; functionality of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells; transcriptional and B-cell receptor profile on unfractionated LN and PB samples; and plasma biomarker measurements. A group of 19 healthy controls (HC, n = 19) was used as a comparator. T-cell and B-cell lymphopenia was present in PB pre-ART in HIV(+) patients. CD4:CD8 and CD4 T- and B-cell PB subsets partly normalized compared to HC post-ART as viral load decreased. Strikingly in LN, ART led to a rapid decrease in interferon signaling pathways and an increase in Tfh, germinal center and IgD(-)CD27(-) B cells, consistent with histological findings of post-ART follicular hyperplasia. However, there was evidence of cTfh cells with decreased helper capacity and of limited B-cell receptor diversification post-ART. In conclusion, we found early signs of immune reconstitution, evidenced by a surge in LN germinal center cells, albeit limited in functionality, in HIV(+) patients who initiate ART late in disease.","output":"Rapid Emergence of T Follicular Helper and Germinal Center B Cells Following Antiretroviral Therapy in Advanced HIV Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global prevalent ptxP3 strains varies from about 10% to about 50% of circulating B. pertussis population in different areas of China. METHODS: To investigate the difference of vaccination status between different genotypes in the circulating B. pertussis after 10 years of acellular pertussis vaccine (aPV) used in China. The nasopharyngeal swabs and isolates of B. pertussis from these patients were used to perform genotyping of antigen genes. We use antibiotic susceptibility test against erythromycin and sequencing methods for site 2047 of 23S rRNA to determine the resistance status. RESULTS: The ptxP1 allele with erythromycin resistant (ER) B. pertussis infection (total of 449 subjects) consisted of 84.70 to 96.70% from 2012 to 2016 in this study. Vaccinated with co-purified aPV was found in 133(133/403,33.0%), 1(1/9,11.1%) and 2(2/21,9.5%) in ptxP1/fhaB3-ER, ptxP1/fhaB2-ES and ptxP3/fhaB2-ES B. pertussis infected children each, which showed a significant difference (&#967;2 = 6.87, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The ptxP3-ES B. pertussis was rare while the ptxP1-ER B. pertussis was steadily increased in Xi'an, China from 2012 to 2016, where co-purified aPV was prevalent used. This pose a hypothesis that the co-purified aPV might protect against ptxP3 strains more efficient, which generated a rare chance for ptxP3 strains to be under the antibiotic pressure and further developed to be erythromycin resistance. A further cohort study and the mechanisms of the additional antigen proteins of co-purified aPV protected against B. pertussis should be consideration.","output":"The global prevalence ptxP3 lineage of Bordetella pertussis was rare in young children with the co-purified aPV vaccination: a 5 years retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Two sequelae of pediatric COVID-19 have been identified, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and the long COVID. Long COVID is much less precisely defined and includes all the persistent or new clinical manifestations evidenced in subjects previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 beyond the period of the acute infection and that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. In this Intersociety Consensus, present knowledge on pediatric long COVID as well as how to identify and manage children with long COVID are discussed. MAIN FINDINGS: Although the true prevalence of long COVID in pediatrics is not exactly determined, it seems appropriate to recommend evaluating the presence of symptoms suggestive of long COVID near the end of the acute phase of the disease, between 4 and 12 weeks from this. Long COVID in children and adolescents should be suspected in presence of persistent headache and fatigue, sleep disturbance, difficulty in concentrating, abdominal pain, myalgia or arthralgia. Persistent chest pain, stomach pain, diarrhea, heart palpitations, and skin lesions should be considered as possible symptoms of long COVID. It is recommended that the primary care pediatrician visits all subjects with a suspected or a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 4 weeks to check for the presence of symptoms of previously unknown disease. In any case, a further check-up by the primary care pediatrician should be scheduled 3 months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to confirm normality or to address emerging problems. The subjects who present symptoms of any organic problem must undergo a thorough evaluation of the same, with a possible request for clinical, laboratory and / or radiological in-depth analysis in case of need. Children and adolescents with clear symptoms of mental stress will need to be followed up by existing local services for problems of this type. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric long COVID is a relevant problem that involve a considerable proportion of children and adolescents. Prognosis of these cases is generally good as in most of them symptoms disappear spontaneously. The few children with significant medical problems should be early identified after the acute phase of the infection and adequately managed to assure complete resolution. A relevant psychological support for all the children during COVID-19 pandemic must be organized by health authorities and government that have to treat this as a public health issue.

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students. This will assist relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh government, educational institutions, and researchers) to gain necessary insights and theoretical understanding of underlying limitations and emergent directions to arrange adequate support for underprivileged students to undertake essential online learning activities.","output":"The Latent Digital Divide and Its Drivers in E-Learning among Bangladeshi Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Some patients with COVID-19 infection develop proteinuria or Acute Kidney Injury, and cases of COVID-19 related Collapsing Glomerulopathy have also been reported. Three published human kidney biopsy studies did not find viral particles in the glomeruli or tubules. This raises the possibility of glomerular and kidney injury induced by the extensive cytokine storm documented early on in the pandemic in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Mutated forms of Human Angiopoietin-like 4 (protein 8520) were previously shown to reduce proteinuria in rat models of FSGS and diabetic nephropathy (Clement LC, Mace C et al. Nature Medicine 2014). Using different components or innate and adaptive immunity triggered during infection, we developed cytokine cocktails that mimic the COVID-19 cytokine storm, and tested the ability of protein 8520 to reduce glomerular injury in this model. Methods: After baseline urine and blood collections, two groups of BALB/c mice (mean n = 5 mice per group) were injected intravenously with dose 1.8 X of COVID Cocktail D. One hour later, they received 10 g of His-Tag purified protein 8520 or control human albumin. Overall activity status was documented at 6 and 24 hours. At 24 hours after model induction, blood and urine samples were collected, and the mice euthanized, followed by harvesting of multiple organs including kidneys. Urine albumin was measured by ELISA (Bethyl Labs), and urine and serum creatinine by Mass Spectrometry. Results: Baseline urine albumin to creatinine ratio was similar between the two groups. At 24 hours, urine albumin to creatinine ratio was significantly lower in the 8520 treated compared to control treated group (P < 0.05). Serum creatinine on Day 1 was similar between both groups, and not significantly elevated compared to baseline. Kidney sections were processed for light and electron microscopy, and analysis of these studies is in progress. Conclusions: Treatment with recombinant mutated human Angiopoietin-like 4 reduces albuminuria in a mouse model of the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Further studies will be conducted to establish a potential therapeutic role in viral cytokine storms.

Music can contribute to enhancing wellbeing, but the extent of this effect may be modulated by both personal and context-related variables. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the two types of variables on the perceived efficacy of musical behaviors to fulfill adults emotional wellbeing-related goals during the lockdown established in Spain. Personal variables included age, gender, musical training, personality, resilience, and perception of musics importance. Contextual variables referred to living in a region with a high COVID-19 impact, perception of belonging to a risk group, being alone, having caring responsibilities during confinement, and amount of time of music listening as compared to prior to the crisis. The study was conducted retrospectively during AugustCDecember 2020, when the strict lockdown was over in Spain. An online survey was disseminated among the general population and groups of musicians, and the answers of 507 adults (from 18 years on, 73.9% females, 51.3% musically trained adults) were analyzed. Only personal, but not COVID-19 context-related variables, showed an impact on musics efficacy. The youngest age group of adults and those with musical training reported the highest efficacy of music for wellbeing enhancement, and musics importance was found to be the main significant predictor of musics perceived efficacy. Our findings suggest that the people who have been reported to be emotionally more vulnerable during the lockdown, due to either a strong impact on their daily lives or their lower resilience, perceive a higher benefit from musical behaviors. Being musically trained, even for a small number of years, also leads to a perception of higher efficacy of music for the achievement of emotional wellbeing goals. However, this effect is explained by the musically trained individuals higher perception of musics importance. Although musical behaviors can be generally considered as important for wellbeing enhancement, our study highlights who are the potential individuals who could benefit the most from music-related activities for obtaining better levels of wellbeing, at least within the current context of the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"The Efficacy of Music for Emotional Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain: An Analysis of Personal and Context-Related Variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annually, there are between 2500 and 3000 Christmas markets in Germany.

The experiential dimension is a collection of visual, auditory, and olfactory components that create a compound sensory response: the Christmas atmosphere. The prevalence of COVID-19 meant that traditional Christmas markets were largely absent from the festive calendar in Germany in 2020, disrupting the usual sensory experiences associated with these events. A review of the online presence showed that augmented markets and virtual reality were subsequently utilized in an attempt to re-create the experience and the ambience of the traditional markets, but had limited interactivity with many of the senses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at Latifa hospital, Dubai. Fifty-nine patients enrolled from March to June 2020 and divided into 2 groups: patients who received the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (group 1) and patients who received the therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (group 2). RESULTS: The mean age of all cases was 47.2  10.4 years, while the mean weight was 76.4  13.4 kg. Males represented 79.7% of cases. Blood group O was the most frequent blood group (40.9%). None of the cases were smokers or using alcohol. Bronchial asthma, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, CKD, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, and immunodeficiency were present in 1.7, 1.7, 39, 27.1, 5.1, 1.7, 5.1, and 1.7% respectively. There was no significant difference between both study groups regarding personal and medical characteristics, except for hypertension where 35.9% of group 2 (therapeutic) cases were hypertensive compared to 10% of group 1 cases (prophylactic). There was a significant difference between both study groups regarding inflammatory markers improvement duration, duration of MV and O2 support duration, with longer duration among (therapeutic) group 2 cases compared to group 1 cases (prophylactic). There was a highly significant difference between both study groups regarding ICU admission, as 64% of group 1 cases were admitted compared to 25% of group 1 cases. Similarly, 38.5% of group 2 cases needed MV compared to only 10% of group 1 cases, which was statistically significant. There was no significant difference between both groups regarding bleeding tendency and mortality (p value 0.54). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that use of prophylactic dose of enoxaparin might have some benefits compared to the therapeutic dose in terms of less duration of ICU and hospital stay, duration of oxygen support, need and duration of MV, and normalization of inflammatory markers.

We divided the patient age range into four equal intervals. Results: Multivariate demographic and microbiological variables did not show an association between bacteria distributions and gender and age. The distribution by units showed a higher prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii in the intensive care unit (ICU) and Escherichia coli in the non-intensive care units (non-ICUs). The analysis of antibiotic resistance showed that E. coli was susceptible to a large class of antibiotics such as carbapenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. K. pneumoniae showed a significant susceptibility to colistin, tigecycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. From the survival analysis, patients with E. coli had a higher survival rate. Conclusions: The authors stress the importance of the implementation of large community-level programs to prevent E. coli bacteremia.

Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. METHODS: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015C16 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43). RESULTS: Nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 9 out of 90 (10%) surface samples, including: a plastic toy dog in the childrens playground (2/3 swabs, 67%); hand-carried luggage trays at the security check area (4/8, 50%); the buttons of the payment terminal at the pharmacy (1/2, 50%); the handrails of stairs (1/7, 14%); and the passenger side desk and divider glass at a passport control point (1/3, 33%).

In this study adherence to ART regimens among patients with HIV-1 (PWH) across the US during a recent time period was examined and study findings were stratified by US region and state. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Symphony Health Solution Integrated Dataverse database was conducted. Patients  18 years of age who had a diagnosis of HIV-1 (without an HIV-2 diagnosis) and who were treated with ART between July 2017 and September 2018 (first pharmacy record: index date) were selected from the data source. Both patients who had not been previously treated with ART and those who were treatment experienced were included. Patients were required to have  1 medical/pharmacy record  12 months after their index date (follow-up period). Patient characteristics were examined during a 12-month pre-index period. During the follow-up, medication adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC), was examined for all patients and stratified by US region and state. RESULTS: Among 206,474 adult PWH treated with ART, mean age was 47.9 years, 73.4% were male, and 30.0% were Caucasian. The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hyperlipidemia (25.1%), depressive disorders (14.8%), and type 2 diabetes (12.1%). During the follow-up period, mean (standard deviation) PDC was 74.1% (25.9%) among PWH across the US [Midwest: 74.4% (25.5%); Northeast: 74.3% (26.1%); South: 73.2% (26.3%); West: 76.4% (24.8%)]. Across all US regions, > 60% of PWH had adherence < 90% and > 40% had adherence < 80%; the West had the highest adherent population. CONCLUSIONS: Among PWH treated with ART across the US, a majority had suboptimal adherence. Implementation of strategies to improve ART adherence, including clinical consideration of ARTs with high genetic barriers to resistance, is needed in the US.

However, it presents technical challenges and may create an environment of social isolation. A blended learning approach combines E-learning with traditional methods of teaching and offers advantages over either approach alone.

These tools are open access and structured around the science of cognitive learning using animation, interactivity, self-assessment and immediate feedback features. They have been viewed by a wide audience of nephrologists, dialysis nurses as well as medicine house-staff and have received strong validation in a post-test survey. The online tools have supported a flipped classroom instructive model and our blended curriculum has been successfully used for nephrology fellow training at our institution.

It is postulated that either the cytokine storm induced by the viral infection or endothelial damage caused by viral binding to the ACE-2 receptor may activate a cascade leading to a hypercoaguable state. Although pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis have been well described in patients with COVID-19 infection, there is a paucity of literature on cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cVST) associated with COVID-19 infection. cVST is an uncommon etiology of stroke and has a higher occurrence in women and young people. We report a series of three patients at our institution with confirmed COVID-19 infection and venous sinus thrombosis, two of whom were male and one female. These cases fall outside the typical demographic of patients with cVST, potentially attributable to COVID-19 induced hypercoaguability. This illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for cVST in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with unexplained cerebral hemorrhage, or infarcts with an atypical pattern for arterial occlusive disease.","output":"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in COVID-19 Infection: A Case Series and Review of The Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused approximately 2,350,000 infections worldwide and killed more than 160,000 individuals. In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. Methods: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ + standard treatment). Conclusion: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.

It is well recognized that spatial-temporal control over the delivery of these biomolecules will greatly impact their pharmacokinetic profile and ultimately their therapeutic effect. Nanoparticles (NPs) prepared from different materials have been tested successfully in the clinic for the delivery of several biomolecules including non-coding RNAs (siRNA and miRNA) and mRNAs. Indeed, the recent success of mRNA vaccines is in part due to progress in the delivery systems (NP based) that have been developed for many years. In most cases, the identification of the best formulation was done by testing a small number of novel formulations or by modification of pre-existing ones. Unfortunately, this is a low throughput and time-consuming process that hinders the identification of formulations with the highest potential. Alternatively, high-throughput combinatorial design of NP libraries may allow the rapid identification of formulations with the required release and cell/tissue targeting profile for a given application. Combinatorial approaches offer several advantages over conventional methods since they allow the incorporation of multiple components with varied chemical properties into materials, such as polymers or lipid-like materials, that will subsequently form NPs by self-assembly or chemical conjugation processes.

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","output":"A longitudinal and geospatial analysis of COVID-19 tweets during the early outbreak period in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune Addison's Disease (AAD) is an endocrine and immunological disease of uncertain pathogenesis resulting from the immune system's destruction of the hormone producing cells of the adrenal cortex.

Exact structural elucidation of glycans is generally beyond the capability of a single mass spectrometry experiment, so a reasonable level of identification for tandem mass spectrometry, taken by several glycopeptide software tools, is that of peptide sequence and glycan composition, meaning the number of monosaccharides of each distinct mass, for example HexNAc(2)Hex(5) rather than man5. Even at this level, however, glycopeptide analysis poses challenges: finding glycopeptide spectra when they are a tiny fraction of the total spectra; assigning spectra with unanticipated glycans, not in the initial glycan database; and finding, scoring, and labeling diagnostic peaks in tandem mass spectra. Here we discuss recent improvements to Byonic, a glycoproteomics search program, that address these three issues. Byonic now supports filtering spectra by m/z peaks, so that the user can limit attention to spectra with diagnostic peaks, for example, at least two out of three of 204.087 for HexNAc, 274.092 for NeuAc (with water loss), and 366.139 for HexNAc-Hex, all within a set mass tolerance, for example,  0.01 Daltons. Also new is glycan \\"wildcard\\" search, which allows an unspecified mass within a user-set mass range to be applied to N- or O-linked glycans and enables assignment of spectra with unanticipated glycans.

This crisis has created a unique situation in the care of spine patients as we must balance the urgency of patient evaluation, surgical intervention, and continued training against the risk of disease exposure and resource management.The Spine division of an Orthopaedic Surgery Department at a tertiary care and academic center has taken an active role in enacting protocol changes in anticipation of COVID-19. In the past four weeks, since these changes were enacted, the Spine division has performed ten surgeries compared to an average of 60.4 spine cases performed annually over the same time period between 2015-2019. Furthermore, the number of clinic visits decreased from an average of 417.4 over this time period, to 322 with the percentage of new patient visits decreasing from 28% to 20%. During COVID-19, 318 of the 322 spine clinic visits were performed remotely via telehealth.The response to COVID-19 has been variable among surgical subspecialties and geographic regions. We present the changes that have been made regarding the care of spine patients at a busy academic center. Although these changes have been forced upon us by necessity, we feel that our division and department will emerge in a more responsive, agile and stronger state. As we look to the coming months and beyond, it will be important to continue to adapt to the changing landscape during unprecedented times.","output":"Response to COVID-19 Pandemic by the Spine Division at a Level-1 Academic Referral Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unparalleled struggle has been witnessed among the urban women informal workers of Midnapore and Kharagpur cities in West Bengal, India. Many researchers have advocated and are advocating about the deadly impact of COVID-19 pandemic situation on the women informal workers but very few were concentrated on their coping capabilities. These women in the study area have set an example before others that how can one survive her livelihood in the time of critical situation. Despite all the hardships they have been fighting their own lonely battle not only against this situation but also a lot of serious threats like insecurity, low resources and low standard of living. This study mainly highlights the measures taken by these poor women to cope with this situation for the survival of their families along with the external supports provided for them. This is strictly a perception based study conducted among 500 women selected by purposive sampling procedure across age, ethnicity, income and educational level during unlock phases with the help of semi-structured and open ended questionnaire schedule. The result reveals that although their capabilities and efforts to cope with this devastating situation are praiseworthy but it is a hard reality that this pandemic put its evil imprint in every step of their daily livelihoods. The various measures have already been taken by the government but, these measures have to be continued till the situation will become normal along with gender sensitive long term benefit.","output":"The analysis of unparalleled struggle for existence of urban women informal workers in West Bengal, India for survival and resilience to COVID-19 pandemic risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective, randomized trial of influenza immunization in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal. Women were enrolled in their second trimester of pregnancy and followed until six months postpartum. Active weekly home-based surveillance for febrile respiratory illness was performed. Mid-nasal swabs collected with episodes of respiratory illness were tested for RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 14 (0.4%) illness episodes in 3693 women over 3554 person-years of surveillance from 2011C2014. RSV incidence was 3.9/1000 person-years overall, and 11.8/1000 person-years between September and December. Seven (50%) women sought care for RSV illness; none died. Of the 7 (50%) illness episodes during pregnancy, all had live births with 2 (29%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 3060 grams. This compares to 469 (13%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 2790 grams in women without RSV during pregnancy. Of the 7 mothers with postpartum RSV infection, RSV was detected in 4 (57%) of their infants. CONCLUSIONS: RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in mothers during pregnancy in Nepal. These data will inform prevention and therapeutic strategies against RSV in resource-limited settings.","output":"Clinical Presentation and Birth Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In response to the illegal wildlife trade, successful enforcement often involves the seizure, confiscation, and subsequent management of illegally traded wildlife. Unfortunately, confiscated live animals often experience substandard care. In this study, we investigate the barriers to the disposal of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia. Disposal is the term used for what happens to illegally traded wildlife after confiscation. Guidelines for the disposal of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual nations must enforce this within their own legislation. We interviewed 18 experts from seven countries in Southeast Asia revealing eight categories of barriers to the disposal of confiscated live animals. We then propose seven recommendations to help reform the disposal of confiscated live animals, which would support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife in Southeast Asia and globally. ABSTRACT: Increased focus on the illegal global wildlife trade has resulted in greater numbers of live animals confiscated by authorities, increasing the need to manage these animals responsibly. Most wildlife seizures take place in Southeast Asia, with global demand for live animals fuelling much of the trafficking. Guidelines for the disposal of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual Parties must implement provisions through national laws and regulations. Disposal is the term used for the management of illegally traded wildlife upon confiscation. Confiscated live animals can be euthanised (i.e., killed), repatriated to their native country and released, or kept in captivity. This study investigates barriers to proper care and disposal of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia, where roughly one quarter of the global multibillion dollar illegal wildlife trade takes place. Interviews were conducted with 18 professionals working within conservation, wildlife crime, and confiscated live animal management. Eight limitations to the proper care and disposal of confiscated wildlife were identified: (1) political will, (2) policy, (3) funding, (4) capacity, (5) expertise (6) attitudes and behaviours, (7) exploitation, and (8) corruption. Based on interviews, we propose seven key reforms to support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife for national authorities and CITES parties. These are wildlife seizure management, legislative support, enhanced political will, demand reduction, global participation, registry of rescue centres, and terminology change. This research highlights major barriers to the proper care and disposal of live confiscated animals and proposes key reforms to improve the conservation of threatened species and the welfare of millions of illegally traded animals.","output":"Surviving the Wildlife Trade in Southeast Asia: Reforming the Disposal of Confiscated Live Animals under CITES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On October 16 to 18, 2021, the 3-day 7th International Summit of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy was held virtually with almost 700 registrants and faculty from 40 countries and 42 states (Drs.

People with pre-existing health conditions have been markedly impacted and, in some instances, left unsupported due to reduced provision of routine healthcare services. People living with obesity (PLWO) are identified as at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence about the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO, including those accessing weight management and bariatric surgery services (WMS). Methods: 543 adults (16-80 years) with obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) were recruited between 14th May and 9th July 2020 through social media advertisements, professional and patient obesity organisations and WMS. Participants completed an online survey regarding the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon, mental health, well-being, health-related behaviours, risk mitigating behaviours, access to WMS and weight stigma. Findings: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, the majority of PLWO reported deterioration of their mental health and health-related behaviours such as diet, physical activity (PA) and sleep. With 55% reporting an unhealthier diet, 61% reduced PA and 80% worsening of their sleep. Higher depression and lower wellbeing scores were found to associate with the greatest adverse impact upon health-related behaviours. PLWO who were attending WMS prior to the first lockdown reported a greater deterioration of their diet, with nearly 50% reporting worsening of their diet and PA worsening compared to PLWO who were not attending WMS. Most participants took two or more risk mitigating actions (73%). PLWO attending WMS reported reduced access (44%) with insufficient information (49%) from their clinical service providers. The majority of participants reported no change in perceived weight stigma. Interpretation: This study shows the detrimental impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO in relation to health-related behaviours, mental health and access to WMS. Our findings show that PLWO with poor mental health and those attending WMS were most adversely impacted and highlights the need for greater mental health support and continued provision of support from WMS for PLWO during future lockdowns. Funding: This research was funded through National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre funding.","output":"Negative impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon health-related behaviours and psychological wellbeing in people living with severe and complex obesity in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 8 April 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life-structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between 3 and 7 April 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18 and 22 April 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6 and 10 May 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25 and 29 May 2020 (Time 4). This four-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents' psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted. The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020. Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf.io/g2t3b. This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis. Generally, our study found that: (i) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted; (ii) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normality and restored structure of everyday life; (iii) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted; (iv) people who used problem solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown; (v) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown.","output":"A COVID-19 descriptive study of life after lockdown in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes various hematological abnormalities, leading to several complications in the disease course.

I merged 2018 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) national employment and wage data with measures ranking the importance of computer use at work and the importance of working with or performing for the public from the BLS O*NET survey.Results. Approximately 25% (35.6 million) of US workers are employed in occupations (such as technology, administrative, financial, and engineering) that could be done from home; the remaining 75% work in occupations (including health care, manufacturing, retail, and food services) that are challenging to do from home.Conclusions. Most US workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 million workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a pandemic. These workers tend to be lower paid.

It is well known that the design of the HD catheter has a considerable effect on blood recirculation and thrombus formation around it, which may cause inefficiencies or malfunctions during HD. However, hemodynamic analyses through parametric studies of its designs have been rarely performed; moreover, only comparisons between the existing models have been reported. In this study, we numerically analyzed the design of the HD catheter's side hole and distal tip for evaluating their effects on hemodynamic factors such as recirculation rate (RR), shear stress, and blood damage index (BDI). The results indicated that a larger side hole and a nozzle-shaped distal tip can significantly reduce the RR and shear stress around the HD catheter. Furthermore, based on these hemodynamic insights, we proposed three new HD catheter designs and compared their performances with existing catheters using numerical and in vitro methods. These new designs exhibited lower RRs and BDI values, thus providing better performance than the existing models. These results can help toward commercialization of more efficient HD catheters.","output":"Development of New Hemodialysis Catheter Using Numerical Analysis and Experiments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"A Different Kind of Storm: Natech Events in Houstons Fenceline Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Social media remains a growing platform for physicians to facilitate learning, network, and disseminate information.

Instagram is a platform that can be used by residency programs to increase engagement and as a potential recruitment tool. The authors present social media failed and successful strategies used to increase engagement and gain new followers. Methods In June 2020, an initiative began to use Instagram on a more frequent and intentional basis. Three different strategies were implemented during the pandemic: mirroring Twitter posts, increasing multimedia, and leveraging Instagram Stories. The outcomes of interest included number of followers and engagement on posts. Data were collected October 2020. Results After June 1, 2020, the @mayoanesthesia account gained 1000 followers through 127 days, an average of 4.26 new followers each day. Before June 1, there were 24 total posts over 3.3 years with a total of 458 followers. Three different strategies were implemented at different times during the pandemic. During the mirroring Twitter posts period, the mean number of interactions per post was 14.5.

As physical inactivity is a leading global risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCD), physical activity promotion is a strategy for their mitigation. Physiotherapists are already ideally situated to undertake this role and can assist in the reversal of NCD. Gaining insight into how physiotherapists in Nigeria perceive their role in relation to physical activity promotion is needed to ensure this undertaking will be effective. This national survey aimed to investigate Nigerian physiotherapists knowledge and current practice for promoting physical activity across Nigeria and perceptions of their role related to this. METHODS: Following ethical approval, a cross-sectional, online questionnaire survey design was employed to investigate the aim. 330 qualified physiotherapists, working across Nigeria were recruited. Internal consistency of the survey was examined using Cronbachs alpha. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse closed questions. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse open-ended questions. Chi-square inferential statistic was used to investigate the association between variables with alpha interpreted at a level of 0.05. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the questionnaire survey was good overall (Cronbach Alpha  = 0.71). 330 physiotherapists participated. 99.4% agreed that discussing the benefits of a physically active lifestyle with patients is part of their role. However, over 60% did not feel confident in suggesting specific physical activity programs for their patients. 59.7% were aware of one or more physical activity guideline. However, only 49.1% were incorporating it into their practice. 85.5% felt that developing a physical activity guideline specifically for Nigeria would promote physical activity. 63.3% of respondents did not use any resource in promoting physical activity. An association was found between the physiotherapists awareness of physical activity guidelines and male sex ((2) = 8.95, df = 2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Whilst most physiotherapists had a positive perception of their role in promoting physical activity, translating this into practice would seem to be challenging. A systems approach to physical activity health promotion is recommended with the need for a commitment by the Nigerian Government to the development and implementation of national guidelines. Incorporating more training in physiotherapy education could foster more confidence in the delivery of these guidelines. Greater use of resources and working with community organisations could help to optimise physical activity uptake in Nigeria.","output":"Nigerian physiotherapists knowledge, current practice and perceptions of their role for promoting physical activity: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models have assisted in describing the transmission and propagation dynamics of various viral diseases like MERS, measles, SARS, and Influenza; while the advanced computational technique is utilized in the epidemiology of viral diseases to examine and estimate the influences of interventions and vaccinations.

There is a gap of quantitative evidence about the transgenerational impacts of these experiences and factors. Objective: To identify baseline predictors of COVID-19 experiences, as defined by child and parent report, using a multivariate pattern-learning framework from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: ABCD is an ongoing prospective longitudinal study of child and adolescent development in the United States including 11875 youths, enrolled at age 9 to 10 years. Using nationally collected longitudinal profiling data from 9267 families, a multivariate pattern-learning strategy was developed to identify factor combinations associated with transgenerational costs of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ABCD data (release 3.0) collected from 2016 to 2020 and released between 2019 and 2021 were analyzed in combination with ABCD COVID-19 rapid response data from the first 3 collection points (May-August 2020). Exposures: Social distancing and other response measures imposed by COVID-19, including school closures and shutdown of many childhood recreational activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mid-COVID-19 experiences as defined by the ABCD's parent and child COVID-19 assessments. Results: Deep profiles from 9267 youth (5681 female [47.8%];mean [SD] age, 119.0 [7.5] months) and their caregivers were quantitatively examined. Enabled by a pattern-learning analysis, social determinants of inequity, including family structure, socioeconomic status, and the experience of racism, were found to be primarily associated with transgenerational impacts of COVID-19, above and beyond other candidate predictors such as preexisting medical or psychiatric conditions. Pooling information across more than 17000 baseline pre-COVID-19 family indicators and more than 280 measures of day-to-day COVID-19 experiences, non-White (ie, families who reported being Asian, Black, Hispanic, other, or a combination of those choices) and/or Spanish-speaking families were found to have decreased resources (mode 1, canonical vector weight [CVW] = 0.19;rank 5 of 281), escalated likelihoods of financial worry (mode 1, CVW = -0.20;rank 4), and food insecurity (mode 1, CVW = 0.21;rank 2), yet were more likely to have parent-child discussions regarding COVID-19-associated health and prevention issues, such as handwashing (mode 1, CVW = 0.14;rank 9), conserving food or other items (mode 1, CVW = 0.21;rank 1), protecting elderly individuals (mode 1, CVW = 0.11;rank 21), and isolating from others (mode 1, CVW = 0.11;rank 23). In contrast, White families (mode 1, CVW = -0.07;rank 3), those with higher pre-COVID-19 income (mode 1, CVW = -0.07;rank 5), and presence of a parent with a postgraduate degree (mode 1, CVW = -0.06;rank 14) experienced reduced COVID-19-associated impact. In turn, children from families experiencing reduced COVID-19 impacts reported longer nighttime sleep durations (mode 1, CVW = 0.13;rank 14), less difficulties with remote learning (mode 2, CVW = 0.14;rank 7), and decreased worry about the impact of COVID-19 on their family's financial stability (mode 1, CVW = 0.134;rank 13).

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses use intracellular machineries and pathways for efficient replication in their host target cells. Interestingly, certain viruses, and, more especially, enveloped viruses belonging to different viral families and including human pathogens, can mediate cell-cell fusion between infected cells and neighboring non-infected cells. Depending of the cellular environment and tissue organization, this virus-mediated cell-cell fusion leads to the merge of membrane and cytoplasm contents and formation of multinucleated cells, also called syncytia, that can express high amount of viral antigens in tissues and organs of infected hosts. This ability of some viruses to trigger cell-cell fusion between infected cells as virus-donor cells and surrounding non-infected target cells is mainly related to virus-encoded fusion proteins, known as viral fusogens displaying high fusogenic properties, and expressed at the cell surface of the virus-donor cells. Virus-induced cell-cell fusion is then mediated by interactions of these viral fusion proteins with surface molecules or receptors involved in virus entry and expressed on neighboring non-infected cells.

Comparative hesitancy towards these vaccines grew over the course of fielding as controversy arose over their link to extremely rare, but serious side effects. Comparative vaccine-specific hesitancy is strongest among people who are usually most open to mass vaccination efforts. Its effects are substantial: most respondents reported a willingness to wait months for their preferred vaccine rather than receive either the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccine immediately.

We surveyed a large nationally representative sample of adults (18-91 years, N = 704) at three 1-month intervals across the acute lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, using standardized measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. At each time point, we also measured the use of two emotion regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression-previously associated with adaptive and maladaptive mental health outcomes, respectively. We found cognitive reappraisal was unrelated to mental health symptoms. In contrast, greater emotional suppression was robustly associated with higher symptom levels for both depression and anxiety. Longitudinal analyses revealed this association reflected bidirectional relationships. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety each predicted greater subsequent use of emotional suppression, and greater use of emotional suppression predicted higher subsequent symptoms. This bidirectionality suggests emotional suppression is both symptomatic and predictive of psychological distress. The lack of a relationship for cognitive reappraisal is discussed with respect to the pandemic context and evidence that high stress might reduce people's ability to use this strategy effectively. Given the strong emphasis on reappraisal in clinical practice, there is a critical need to understand for whom, what and when this strategy is helpful.

However, repeated endoscopy has associated harms and access has been limited during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the role of a non-endoscopic device (Cytosponge) coupled with laboratory biomarkers and clinical factors to prioritise endoscopy for Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: We first conducted a retrospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study in patients older than 18 years who were having endoscopic surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus (with intestinal metaplasia confirmed by TFF3 and a minimum Barrett's segment length of 1 cm [circumferential or tongues by the Prague C and M criteria]). All patients had received the Cytosponge and confirmatory endoscopy during the BEST2 (ISRCTN12730505) and BEST3 (ISRCTN68382401) clinical trials, from July 7, 2011, to April 1, 2019 (UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio 9461). Participants were divided into training (n=557) and validation (n=334) cohorts to identify optimal risk groups. The biomarkers evaluated were overexpression of p53, cellular atypia, and 17 clinical demographic variables. Endoscopic biopsy diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia or cancer was the primary endpoint. Clinical feasibility of a decision tree for Cytosponge triage was evaluated in a real-world prospective cohort from Aug 27, 2020 (DELTA; ISRCTN91655550; n=223), in response to COVID-19 and the need to provide an alternative to endoscopic surveillance. FINDINGS: The prevalence of high-grade dysplasia or cancer determined by the current gold standard of endoscopic biopsy was 17% (92 of 557 patients) in the training cohort and 10% (35 of 344) in the validation cohort. From the new biomarker analysis, three risk groups were identified: high risk, defined as atypia or p53 overexpression or both on Cytosponge; moderate risk, defined by the presence of a clinical risk factor (age, sex, and segment length); and low risk, defined as Cytosponge-negative and no clinical risk factors. The risk of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer in the high-risk group was 52% (68 of 132 patients) in the training cohort and 41% (31 of 75) in the validation cohort, compared with 2% (five of 210) and 1% (two of 185) in the low-risk group, respectively. In the real-world setting, Cytosponge results prospectively identified 39 (17%) of 223 patients as high risk (atypia or p53 overexpression, or both) requiring endoscopy, among whom the positive predictive value was 31% (12 of 39 patients) for high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer and 44% (17 of 39) for any grade of dysplasia. INTERPRETATION: Cytosponge atypia, p53 overexpression, and clinical risk factors (age, sex, and segment length) could be used to prioritise patients for endoscopy. Further investigation could validate their use in clinical practice and lead to a substantial reduction in endoscopy procedures compared with current surveillance pathways.

The aim of this study was to assess current evidence to determine whether antiviral therapy is associated with better outcomes in these patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Database and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 25 May 2020. All clinical studies investigating the effects of antiviral therapy on the outcome of mechanically ventilated ICU patients in whom HSV was detected in the respiratory tract were eligible for inclusion, regardless of study design, publication status or language. Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently by two authors. If the articles seemed eligible, full-text articles were reviewed and data extracted. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary endpoint was hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (one randomized controlled trial, eight cohort studies). Antiviral treatment was associated with lower hospital mortality (with antiviral treatment, 40.6% (189 out of 465 patients); without, 52.7% (193 out of 366 patients); RR 0.74 [0.64, 0.85]; eight studies, low quality of evidence). Furthermore, antiviral treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality (RR 0.75 [0.59, 0.94]; three studies, very low quality of evidence). We did not observe evidence for differences in ICU mortality (RR 0.73 [0.51, 1.05]; three studies, very low quality of evidence). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of the available data shows that antiviral therapy might result in lower hospital and 30-day all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated ICU patients who are positive for HSV in the respiratory tract. However, this result must be interpreted with great caution due to the high risk of bias and limited number of patients. Large, well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials are urgently needed.

Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. Methods: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = 3571) in spring and autumn 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = 2328). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6C33.0)) and male students (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7C28.1)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9C13.2)) and male (8.5% (6.6C11.0)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. Conclusions: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population.

We compared the clinical characteristics between younger patients (aged &lt;60 years) and older patients (aged 60 years) with COVID-19, detected the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital stay, and examined the treatments commonly used with a particular focus on antiviral therapies. Methods : This retrospective study was conducted at the West Campus, Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The sample consisted of 123 patients admitted to the hospital between February 9, 2020, and March 3, 2020. The data related to the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment were analyzed to identify discrepancies between younger and older patients and those with and without primary diseases. The risk factors that contribute to a prolonged hospital stay were subsequently identified. Results : Patients aged 60 years required longer hospital stay than younger patients (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001, respectively). The percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in older patients and those with primary diseases (P = 0.016 and P = 0.042, respectively). The findings revealed that the risk factors that contributed to the length of hospital stay were age, the number of days of illness before hospitalization, white blood cell (WBC) count and albumin levels at admission, a neutrophil fraction at discharge, and antibiotic treatment. Analysis using a model that consisted of the above five risk factors for predicting prolonged hospital stay (i.e., &gt;14 days) yielded an area under the ROC (AuROC) curve of 0.716. Antiviral and antibiotic treatments were administered to 97.6% and 39.0% of patients, respectively. The antiviral drugs most commonly administered were traditional Chinese medicine (83.7%) and arbidol (75.6%). Conclusions : In this study, older patients and those with primary diseases were at a higher risk of worse clinical manifestations. The physicians who treat the patients should pay close attention to the risk factors that contribute to the length of hospital stay, which could be used for predicting prolonged hospital stay. Traditional Chinese medicine and arbidol were the most frequently used antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, the extent to which these medications can effectively treat COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","output":"Differences in clinical characteristics between younger and older patients with COVID-19 and their relationship with the length of hospital stay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has officially been declared as a pandemic, and the spread of the virus is placing sustained demands on public health systems. There are speculations that the COVID-19 mortality differences between regions are due to the disparities in the availability of medical resources. Therefore, the selection of patients for diagnosis and treatment is essential in this situation. Military personnel are especially at risk for infectious diseases; thus, patient selection with an evidence-based prognostic model is critical for them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the usability of a novel platform used in the military hospitals in Korea to gather data and deploy patient selection solutions for COVID-19. METHODS: The platform's structure was developed to provide users with prediction results and to use the data to enhance the prediction models. Two applications were developed: a patient's application and a physician's application. The primary outcome was requiring an oxygen supplement. The outcome prediction model was developed with patients from four centers. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed. The outcome of the model for the patient's application was the length of time from the date of hospitalization to the date of the first oxygen supplement use. The demographic characteristics, past history, patient symptoms, social history, and body temperature were considered as risk factors. A usability study with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was conducted on the physician's application on 50 physicians. RESULTS: The patient's application and physician's application were deployed on the web for wider availability. A total of 246 patients from four centers were used to develop the outcome prediction model. A small percentage (n=18, 7.32%) of the patients needed professional care. The variables included in the developed prediction model were age; body temperature; predisease physical status; history of cardiovascular disease; hypertension; visit to a region with an outbreak; and symptoms of chills, feverishness, dyspnea, and lethargy. The overall C statistic was 0.963 (95% CI 0.936-0.99), and the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.976 at day 3 to 0.979 at day 9. The usability of the physician's application was good, with an overall average of the responses to the PSSUQ being 2.2 (SD 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The platform introduced in this study enables evidence-based patient selection in an effortless and timely manner, which is critical in the military.

We determined the effectiveness of 3 doses of mRNA vaccine and early monoclonal antibody therapy in reducing disease severity against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of consecutive SOT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection referred to our transplant center who were followed for at least 30 days. The primary outcome was supplemental oxygen requirement. Effectiveness of sotrovimab and 3 vaccine doses was estimated using adjusted risk ratios (RR). RESULTS: Three-hundred adult organ transplant recipients were included. Seventy-one patients (24.1%) were hospitalized, 44(14.9%) required supplemental oxygen, 19(6.5%) were admitted to the ICU, 15(5.1%) required MV, and 13(4.4%) died. On multivariate analysis, age and multiple comorbidities were risk factors for oxygen requirement. Both receipt of 3 vaccine doses prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and receipt of sotrovimab in the first 7 days of symptom onset was associated with a reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen [RR 0.30 (95%CI:0.17 to 0.54) and RR 0.24 (95% CI:0.1 to 0.59) respectively]. For sotrovimab, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient requiring oxygen was 6.64 (95%CI:4.56-13.66). Both sotrovimab use and having received 3 vaccine doses were also associated with a shorter hospitalization length of stay. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of SOT recipients with Omicron variant COVID-19 infection, prior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses and early monoclonal antibody therapy were independently associated with significantly reduced disease severity.","output":"Impact of Vaccination and Early Monoclonal Antibody Therapy on COVID-19 Outcomes in Organ Transplant Recipients During the Omicron Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we collected information including demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, complications, laboratory tests, treatment, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan, China. We compared the indexes between patients with hypoalbuminemia and normal albumin. Regression model was used to evaluate various influencing factors of patients with hypoalbuminemia and their relationship with clinical outcomes. We also compared the changes of particular laboratory indexes in patients with hypoalbuminemia before and after enteral nutrition therapy. RESULTS: A total of 482 patients were enrolled in the study. About 53.7% patients developed hypoalbuminemia during admission. Patients with hypoalbuminemia were older, had a higher proportion of combined diabetes mellitus, fever, dyspnea, and natriuresis, and had a relatively poorer prognosis than patients with normal albumin. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher levels of CRP, leukocytes, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, creatine kinase, D-dimer, globulin, and lower levels of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Severe, older, anorexia, elevated CRP, and decreased lymphocytes were the independent predictors for decreased albumin in COVID-19 patients. In addition, decreased albumin is correlated with adverse outcomes. Nutritional support therapy to correct serum albumin may improve patient outcomes.

Results showed good perceived life quality and high insomnia prevalence. After sample stratification, the statistical analysis highlighted that personal (gender, age, educational level) and work-related factors (employment in COVID wards, remote working) played different roles in predicting quality of life, insomnia, and coping attitude. Active, Planning, and Acceptance were the most frequently adopted coping strategies. Despite women confirming their attitude in reacting to the difficulties, adopting emotion-focused coping strategies, they showed a higher probability to develop insomnia, so a gender perspective should be considered in the health protection of this working category. An integrated approach should be implemented at individual, interpersonal and organizational levels aiming to monitor psychological distress, favor regular sharing and communication between peers, and also allow conciliation of work with family life. At the organizational level, preventive and protective measures adequate to work-related risk to COVID-19 should be adopted.","output":"Quality of Life, Insomnia and Coping Strategies during COVID-19 Pandemic in Hospital Workers.

The aim of this study was to investigate how social restriction may have contributed to weight changes in adolescents with obesity. Secondary aim was to evaluate possible parameters influencing weight changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Parameters of 51 obese adolescents were compared between two visits: within 2 months before 8 March, start of lockdown, and within 40 days after the end of it. RESULTS: Mean weight gain during lockdown was 2.8  3.7 kg (p < 0.001). Weight increase was higher in males than in females (3.8  3.4 kg vs 1.2  3.7 kg, p = 0.02). The hours dedicated to SB increased (+2.9  2.8 h/day; p < 0.001) while the hours of PA decreased (-1.0  1.6 h/week; p < 0.001). Males spent more hours in SB than females (+3.8  2.7 h/day vs +1.5  2.5 h/day; p = 0.003). There were minor changes in diet during lockdown. The most significant variables influencing both delta BMI and waist/height ratio increase were hours devoted to SB during lockdown and differences in mild and moderate PA before and after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Obese adolescents showed a worsening of obesity during lockdown, with males mainly affected, mainly due to a reduced mild PA and increased hours spent in SB.","output":"Adolescent males suffered from reduced physical activity and increased BMI during COVID- 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has affected the whole world.

In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 67 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Sichuan's Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture were included from February 1, 2020, to March 2, 2020. Their clinical characteristics, as well as radiological and laboratory features, were extracted. Four (6.0%) patients were categorized as severe cases; 39 (58.2%) were non-severe cases, and 24 (35.8%) were asymptomatic cases. A total of 46 (68.7%) patients were associated with cluster infection events in this study. The most common symptoms were cough, sputum production, dyspnea, fatigue or myalgia, and headache. Seven (10.4%) patients showed leucopenia, and 20 (29.9%) patients showed lymphopenia. Lymphocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NPR) were different between the three groups. In total, 14 (20.9%) patients had thrombocytopenia, and prothrombin times (PT) and fibrinogen levels differed between groups. We also found significant differences in sodium, chloride and calcium levels between the three groups. Antiviral therapy did not lead to obvious adverse events or shortened durations from initial positive to subsequent negative nuclei acid tests. Advanced age, hypertension, high neutrophil count, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase levels were identified as independent risk factors for symptomatic cases of COVID-19.

Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province-level in Iran. Therefore, in the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how socioeconomic and climatic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. The analyses are applied to cumulative cases of the disease from February 19(th) to March 18(th). They correspond to obtaining maps associated with quartiles for rates of COVID-19 cases smoothed through a Bayesian technique and relative risks, the calculation of global (Morans I) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), both univariate and bivariate, to derive significant clustering, and the fit of a multivariate spatial lag model considering a set of variables potentially affecting the presence of the disease. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran (p-value< 0.05), indicating that the COVID-19 spread within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases (p-value < 0.05). Interestingly, literacy is a factor that is associated with a decrease in the number of cases (p-value < 0.05), which might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be useful to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread in Iran. One limitation of our analysis is that the most updated information we found concerning socioeconomic and climatic features is not for 2020, or even for a same year, so that the obtained associations should be interpreted with caution. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within Iran.","output":"Spatial analysis of COVID-19 spread in Iran: Insights into geographical and structural transmission determinants at a province level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We report a case-series of Ayurvedic treatment in seven COVID-19 positive patients with multiple comorbidities, categorized as high risk for poor outcome from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is greatly expressed in different tissues including lung alveolar type II cells. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers acute host immune response, inflammatory reactions and cytokine storm leading to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Different studies reported the pleiotropic effects of statins such as the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects via modulation of antigen presentation and adhesion of inflammatory molecules since; statins have potential anti-oxidant and redox balance effects that improve endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular integrity. Objective of the present study is to verify the beneficial and harmful effects of statins in Covid-19. Statins upregulates ACE2 receptors and attenuates the down-regulation effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the ACE2 receptors. Consequently, reduction of ACE2 receptors augment the deleterious effect of angiotensin II (AngII) which causes vasoconstriction and initiation of ALI. On the other hand, statins therapy may increase risk of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 via lowering of low density lipoprotein (LDL) since; circulating LDL adhere and inactivates SARS-CoV-2. Statin therapy improves the outcomes of Covid-19 pneumonia through anti-inflammatory, immune-modulation, and in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. The antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects may reduce Covid-19 induced-coagulopathy and progression of ARDS.","output":"Statins and Covid-19: The Neglected Front of bidirectional effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A single undiagnosed COVID-19 positive patient admitted in the green zone has the potential to infect many Health Care Workers (HCWs) and other patients at any given time with resultant spread of infection and reduction in the available workforce Despite the existing triaging strategy at the Obstetric unit of a tertiary hospital in New Delhi, where all COVID-19 suspects obstetric patients were tested and admitted in orange zone and non-suspects in green zone, asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were found admitted in the green zone This was the trigger to undertake a quality improvement (QI) initiative to prevent the admission of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients in green zones The QI project aimed at reducing the admission of COVID-19 positive patients in the green zone of the unit from 20% to 10% in 4 weeks' time starting 13/6/2020 by means of dynamic triaging A COVID-19 action team was made and after an initial analysis of the problem multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were run to test the change ideas The main change ideas were revised testing strategies and creating gray Zones for patients awaiting COVID-19 test results The admission of unsuspected COVID-19 positive cases in the green zone of the unit reduced from 20% to 0% during the stipulated period There was a significant reduction in the number of HCWs, posted in the green zone, being quarantined or test positive for COVID-19 infection as well The authors conclude that Quality Improvement methods have the potential to develop effective strategies to prevent spread of the deadly Corona virus","output":"Notes from the Field: Dynamic Triaging Using Quality Improvement (QI) Methodology to Prevent the Admission of Asymptomatic COVID Positive Obstetric Patients in New Delhi, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new Coronavirus resembling pneumonia and first appeared in China's Wuhan Province in November 2019.

By NMR and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two HS binding regions in Cst-3: the highly dynamic N-terminal segment and a flexible region located between residue 70-94. The composition of the HS-binding site by two highly dynamic halves is unique in known HS-binding proteins. We further discovered that HS-binding severely impairs the inhibitory activity of Cst-3 towards papain, suggesting the interaction could actively regulate Cst-3 activity.

Thus, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, stool viral tests, and virus exposure are major concerns in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In patients with colorectal cancer and IBD, the colonic mucosa exhibits elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor levels, enhancing COVID-19 susceptibility. In some cases, positive viral stool tests may be the only indicator of infection at admission or after leaving quarantine.

We dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of Salisbury residents. SETTING: Conducted between 5 and 13 April 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 500 residents aged 18 or over. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported anxiety, anger, uncertainty, perceived risk to self and avoidance of Salisbury. RESULTS: Any degree of anxiety, anger and uncertainty was reported by 40.6%, 29.8% and 30.6% of participants, respectively. For the majority, the level of emotion reported was mild. Only 7.0% met the criteria for high anxiety and 5.2% reported feeling any risk to their health, whereas 18.6% reported avoiding Salisbury. Factors associated with avoidance of Salisbury included being female, unable to rule out exposure for oneself or of loved ones, believing the incident was targeted against the general public, and lower trust in the government and responding agencies. Hearing a lot or a little about the recovery support (eg, financial packages), as opposed to nothing at all, and being satisfied with this information were associated with reduced avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the March 2018 Salisbury incident had a relatively modest impact on emotion and risk perception in the community, the number who reported avoiding the city was notable. In this, and in future incidents, assuring people that contamination resulted from a targeted, rather than indiscriminate, incident; demonstrating that contamination is contained within specific areas; improving communication about any financial support; and promoting trust in responding agencies should help provide additional reassurance to the community.","output":"Public responses to the Salisbury Novichok incident: a cross-sectional survey of anxiety, anger, uncertainty, perceived risk and avoidance behaviour in the local community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore whether resveratrol (Res) pretreatment could exert a protective effect on cyclophosphamide (Cy) induced ovarian toxicity in a rat model.

Thus, this study aims to analyse aerosol optical depth from MODIS aerosol product over Peninsular Malaysia before and during the MCO. Data before MCO shows a higher AOD concentration in major part of the eastern coast of the peninsular. This might be due mostly to the long range transport of agricultural or biomass burning season that occur in the Mekong sub-region area as reported by ASEAN Specialised Metrological Centre brought to eastern part of the Peninsular with the Northeast Monsoon wind. Both data before and during MCO managed to capture high AOD concentrations in the Greater Kuala Lumpur as well as area southern of the state of Perak confirming that the resuspension of urban, dust, and open biomass burning aerosols from local sources are dominant in this area. As of quantification of the AOD concentration, The highest reduction was at Temerloh, with -40.3% (0.67-0.4), while the lowest reduction was at Bandaraya Melaka with -4.6% (0.43-0.41). Highest increment of AOD during was detected in Sri Manjung, with value of 56.1% and Kulim Hightech as well as Alor Setar not far behind with, 55.1% and 54.8% respectively. It can be clearly seen that Northern and Central Region contribute to the increase of AOD while the Eastern Region contributes to the reduction of AOD for the study area during this MCO. The overall total AOD average is 0.413 before the MCO and 0.432 during the MCO giving a total increment of 4.6%.","output":"Impact Of Movement Control Order (MCO) Of Covid-19 Pandemic on Aerosol Optical Depth Over Peninsular Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel viral disease with person-to-person transmission that has spread to many countries since the end of 2019. Although many unknowns were resolved within a year and the vaccine is available, it is still a major global health problem. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 infection may present with a considerably wide spectrum of severity and host factors play a significant role in determining the course of the disease. One of these factors is blood groups. Based on previous experience, it is believed that the ABO blood group type affects prognosis, treatment response and length of stay in the hospital. In this study, our aim was to evaluate whether the blood group had an effect on the length of the hospital stay. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed the effect of ABO blood groups, as well as age, on the length of the hospital stay in these settings. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 969 patients admitted to our hospital between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020 were evaluated. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to ABO blood groups. The effect of the ABO blood group by age on the course of the disease, need for intensive care, duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in geriatric patients, was evaluated. RESULTS: Of all the patients, 9.1% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom 83% died. The average length of ICU stay was 11 days (0 - 59). The observed mortality rates in blood groups A, B, AB and 0 were 86.4%, 93.3%, 80.0% and 70.8%, respectively, indicating similar death rates in all ABO blood types. When the Rh phenotype was taken into consideration, no significant changes in results were seen. CONCLUSION: As a result, we could not observe a significant relationship between blood groups and clinical outcomes in this study, which included a sample of Turkish patients with COVID-19.","output":"Effect of ABO blood groups on length of hospital stay according to age in Covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The essay analyses the effects of COVID-19 on contracts Particular attention is focused on the various hypotheses found Uncollectable, impossibility, and / or necessary tracing back to proportion of the contractual positions ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Pandemic, balance of contractual positions and fair remedy.

The use of anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, and anti CTLA-4 antibodies is rapidly expanding. The side effects of ICIs are very different from conventional cytocidal anticancer and molecular target drugs, and may extend to the digestive organs, respiratory organs, thyroid gland, pituitary gland, skin, and others. Although the details of these adverse events are becoming increasingly apparent, much is unknown regarding the effects and adverse events related to infections. This review focuses specifically on the impact of ICIs on respiratory infections. The impact of ICIs on pathogens varies depending on the significance of the role of T-cell immunity in the immune response to the specific pathogen, as well as the different modes of infection (i.e., acute or chronic), although the impact of ICIs on the clinical outcome of infections in humans has not yet been well studied. Enhanced clearance of many pathogens has been shown because immune checkpoint inhibition activates T cells. In contrast, reactivation of tuberculosis associated with ICI use has been reported, and therefore caution is warranted. In COVID-19 pneumonia, ICI administration may lead to exacerbation; however, it is also possible that ICI may be used for the treatment of COVID-19. It has also been shown that ICI has potential in the treatment of intractable filamentous fungal infections. Therefore, expanded clinical applications are expected.","output":"Association of immune checkpoint inhibitors with respiratory infections: A review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The change in planetary albedo due to aerosol-cloud interactions during the industrial era is the leading source of uncertainty in inferring Earth's climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gases from the historical record. The variable that controls aerosol-cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm-3 and 24 cm-3 By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol-cloud interactions is constrained to be -1.2 W?m-2 to -0.6 W?m-2 The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol-cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.","output":"The hemispheric contrast in cloud microphysical properties constrains aerosol forcing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The authors investigate whether firms can ensure their financial stability during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by having ex-ante risk management.

Presentation: A patient living with HIV with virological failure secondary to defaulting antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with hypoxia, clinical and radiological features suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with raised inflammatory markers and D-dimer levels. Management: She was commenced on prophylactic anticoagulation, supplemental oxygen and empirical antibiotics targeting CAP and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, swabbed for COVID-19 infection and had sputa sent for Gene Xpert? TB testing. A day later, COVID-19 results returned positive and the patient was transferred to isolation and added onto dexamethasone and therapeutic anticoagulation. Sputa returned positive for mycobacterium TB a day later, and anti-tuberculosis therapy was added. She remained persistently hypoxic, with a Well's score of 3 placing her at moderate risk for PE, which prompted for a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) being ordered, which demonstrated left lower lobe subsegmental PE.

Its magnitude in terms of morbidity and mortality was greater than any other epidemic. It has particularly affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Its impact, beyond the high mortality, is also economic. The Ebola virus disease spread to several other African countries with limited resources, causing a significant financial burden to their health systems but also impacting the entire economy of the countries. The objective of this essay is to reflect on the consequences of the Ebola virus epidemics on West African economies in the short term. Estimates of the economic burden of the epidemic range from $2.8 billion to $32.6 billion in lost gross domestic product. The sectors affected by the economic crisis are the most important of the contaminated countries, namely agriculture, mining and trade. There has been a halt in socio-economic activities in the most affected regions. The decrease in the number of workers affected by the virus, the exodus to the least affected areas, and the repatriation of government employees have contributed to the decrease in the income of individuals and states. The fear of contamination by foreign countries has reduced imports, but also all tourist activities, which in turn have had an impact on the restaurant and hotel sectors. All these financial and food disruptions have exposed the population of these countries to food insecurity. The analysis of the impact of the Ebola virus on West African economies in the short term was as devastating as the health impact. This impact has directly contributed to a decrease in economic growth not only for the affected countries but also for all West African countries that depend on these same resources. A loss of about US$32.6 billion over two years in the West African region has been estimated, which is equivalent to 3.3% of the regional gross domestic product (GDP) in the absence of Ebola in 2014.","output":"Impact of the recent Ebola epidemic with pandemic potential on the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and other West African countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease appeared in China in December 2019 and has since spread throughout the world The recent outbreak of acute respiratory infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus, named as (SARS-CoV-2) At the moment, there are no specific medications or vaccines to treat COVID-19 Recently, a combination of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) antibiotic is used effectively in treatment of COVID-19 The present article discusses the possibility of the development of a new cost-effective pharmaceutical product combing HCQ and AZM in management of coronavirus infections Such an approach would involve waiving of the in-vivo bioavailability and bioequivalence studies of the conventional oral dosage forms for emergency approval from regulatory affair authorities","output":"Proposing biowaver as a prompt tool for the new pharmaceutical products approval in management of coronavirus outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an avatar system that enables a human operator to visit a remote location via iCub3, a new humanoid robot developed at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) paving the way for the next generation of the iCub platforms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An e-learning course with four computer-assisted simulation materials developed among international faculties was provided to dental undergraduates at dental schools in Japan and Vietnam in 2020. A post-questionnaire survey plus pre- and post-tests were conducted to obtain learners' feedback and assess the success of the course's implementation. RESULTS: Altogether, 41 students participated, with a response rate of 78.8%. The mean post-test score was significantly higher than that of the pre-test (p < 0.001). Students from both groups felt that e-learning was beneficial, useful for their future, and should be continued. CONCLUSION: This study showed that e-learning/course provision could be achieved at an international level by using a common online system, which is beneficial for students to gain a wider perspective and global dental education. Learners indicated that they learned without any major problems in learning operations. This type of educational material creation and course implementation is extremely important in global networking and dental education in the present era; and communication and cooperation between the faculties was important for course provision.

Lockdown in China has been shown to be associated with significant reduction in pollution including the particulate matter component which coincided with the appearance of a viral mutant (Clade G) which steadily displaced the original Clade D after lockdown. The reason why Clade G developed a fitness advantage is as yet unknown. This paper examines the possible role of airborne particulate matter PM2.5 as selective pressure determining viral Clade predominance and further shedding light on the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: The average levels of PM2.5 of a number of cities were obtained from the Air Quality Index (AQI), a real-time assessment of atmospheric pollution. The daily average PM2.5 levels were assessed between January 23rd and April 29th 2020 determined by the timeline when viral counts in Beijing and other cities were available. Daily viral counts of Clades D and G were available starting from the 12th February as determined by the scientific literature published in August 2020. The cities chosen were Beijing, Sheffield, Nottingham, Sydney and Cambridge because of their substantially elevated viral counts compared to other cities. Cities as opposed to vaster areas/nations were chosen as PM2.5 levels vary across regions and countries. Results: For the time period assessed, the Beijing PM2.5 pattern initiated with highly elevated mean PM2.5 levels of 155.8mug/m3 (SD+/-73.6) during high viral counts, followed by 82.1mug/m3 (SD+/-44.9) (p<0.04) when the viral counts decreased. In all the other cities assessed, the pattern differed whereby the PM2.5 levels increased significantly over the preceding baseline contemporaneously with the viral count rise. The changes in these cities PM2.5 levels were on average 31.5mug/m3 before viral counts rose and 56.35mug/m3 contemporaneous with viral count rise. The average levels of PM2.5 in these cities started to decrease one week after lockdown to 46mug/m3 when measured over 2 weeks post-lockdown. As regards the viral counts from data retrieved from Beijing, the latter part of the bell-shaped curve and a subsequent smaller curve of the viral count was available for evaluation. The average viral count for Clade D in Beijing was 11.1(SD+/-13.5) followed by a mean viral count for Clade G was 13.8(SD+/-9.2). Conversely in all the other cities besides Beijing, the viral counts averaged 45.8 for Clade D and 161 for Clade G. The variation in viral counts between cities suggests the strong possibility of variation in the availability of sampling between cities. The newer variant, Clade G demonstrated viral counts initially appearing in mid-February in Beijing to later displace Clade D as the dominant viral Clade. The appearance of Clade G coincided with the decreasing gradient of PM2.5 levels. A number of significant correlations were obtained between PM2.5 levels and the viral count in all the cities reviewed. Conclusion: COVID-19 viral counts appear to increase concomitant with increasing PM2.5 levels. Viral counts of both Clades correlated differentially with PM2.5 levels in all the cities assessed. The significantly highly elevated PM2.5 levels in Beijing resulted in correlating mainly with Clade D, however Clade G began to appear with decreasing PM2.5 levels, suggesting the beginnings for the initial SARS-CoV-2 Clade evolution. Clade G, the newer variant was able to flourish at lower levels of PM2.5 than Clade D. Clade G may possibly have utilized other sources of particulate matter as a viral vector, such as that derived from tobacco smoking, whereby 66% of Chinese males are smokers and 70% of the Chinese non-smoking population are exposed to 2nd hand smoking.

Covid-19 patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies have a severe prognosis with mortality rates around 40%, particularly when on active treatment (Cattaneo et al, Cancer, in press). However, the long-term prognosis and persistence of specific immune responses among those who survive acute infection are unclear. Aim: Pts with hematological diseases were followed longitudinally after the acute phase of COVID-19 according to protocol NP4156 approved by the local EC. Clinical outcome and specific antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were monitored during convalescence, and correlated to the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying hematological disease. Pts and Methods. Pts affected by multiple myeloma (MM), follicular (FL) and diffuse large B-cell (DLC) lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD), myelodysplastic/chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS/MPN) and surviving the acute phase of virologic-proven COVID-19 were eligible. Immune response parameters were evaluated at +1, +3, +6, +9 and +12 months after nasal swab negativization. Antibodies (Ab) to different conformations of COVID-19 virus proteins, nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S), were measured using a highly sensitive luciferase-immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay. Results. Of 51 eligible pts, 41 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Ab at first timepoint (+1m) (6 pts too early, 2 refusal, 2 lost to follow-up). For 9 of them, Ab levels at +3m were also available. Ab levels of 14 controls without hematologic disorders (Ctrls) also surviving COVID-19 were evaluable at +1m and in 9 of them at +3 months as well. Diagnoses included FL (9) and DLC (6) NHL, CLD (7), MM (10), MDS/MPS (9). The status of hematological disease at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis was as follows: diagnosis (n=4; 10%), complete or partial remission (n=16; 39%), relapse/refractory (n=6; 15%; stable (n=15; 36%). Twenty-one pts (51%) were on active treatment, including 6 on chemoimmunotherapy; 7 pts had received chemoimmunotherapy previously. Median time from SARS-CoV-2 detection to swab negativity was 30d (range 8-63), and was not influenced by sex, age, hematologic diagnosis, disease status, nor treatment received. Two pts, both affected by DLC secondary to FL, remained swab-positive at day 119+ and 123+. At +1m, both N- and S- seropositivity rate was slightly lower in pts [N+ in 30/41 (73%); S+ in 27/41 (66%)] vs 13/14 for both N+ and S+ in Ctrls (93%) (P=0.16 and 0.08, respectively). Discrepancies between N and S seropositivity were observed in 7 (17%) pts, all with lymphoid disorders. Ab levels were similar in hematologic pts and in Ctrls (N+ 894,707 vs 870,541 LU and S+ 907,591 LU vs 724,120 LU, respectively, P=NS) (Fig.1a). Both seroconversion rates and Ab levels were not influenced by age, sex, status of hematologic disease, ongoing treatment, time to swab negativity, severity of pneumonia and steroid treatment during acute COVID-19. However, a diagnosis of NHL negatively impacted on seroconversion for both N and S. In 15 pts with NHL compared to 26 pts with other hematologic cancers, the N-seropositivity rate was 47% vs 92%, and the S-seropositivity rate was 40% vs 85%y (P=0.002 and 0.0053, respectively). N and S Ab levels were also lower than in other hematologic diseases (515,281 LU vs 1105409 LU, P=.002 and 474,309 LU vs 1,148,303 LU, P=.005 respectively) (Fig.1b). Rituximab (RTX) had been used in 13 of 15 NHL (87%), and treatment was ongoing in 6/13. While N-seroconversion and Ab levels were not influenced, no pts on ongoing RTX had S-seroconversion vs 5/7 pts with past RTX use (P=0.021) and mean antibody levels were 17622 LU vs 668548 LU, respectively (P=0.008). At +3m, no significant variations of both anti-N and anti-S antibody levels had occurred compared to timepoint +1m. Seroconversion status was maintained by 9/9 Ctrls and by 8/8 pts; the only pt with Ab levels below the cut-off at +1m did not show seroconversion at+3m. Conclusions: Overall, hematologic pts surviving COVID-19 have N- and S- antibodies levels and seroconversion rates similar to controls without hematologic disorders, although time to swab negativity seems more similar to critically ill pts than in the general population. A diagnosis of NHL negatively impacts on seroconversion and Ab levels, and ongoing RTX seems to have a negative role specifically on anti-S Ab production.

We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23  6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87  4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","output":"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score as a Predictor of Hospital Mortality in Patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of slit lamp breath shields to prevent droplet spray from a simulated sneeze. DESIGN: Experimental study to test effectiveness of personal protective equipment. METHODS: The nozzle of a spray gun was adjusted to angularly disperse a mist of colored dye that approximated a patient sneezing on a dimensionally accurate cardboard slit lamp model. We tested the designs of six commercially available breath shields, and one breath shield repurposed from a plastic container lid. Each breath shield was sprayed in a standardized fashion three times and the amount of overspray compared with no shield was quantified. The surface area that was sprayed was calculated using Adobe Photoshops color range function. The average percentage of overspray of each breath shield was computed in comparison to the control. RESULTS: The breath shields ranged in surface area from 116-1254 cm(2) and the amount of overspray varied from 54% to virtually none. Larger breath shields offered better protection than smaller ones. Breath shields attached to the objective lens arm were a better barrier than those hung by the oculars of comparable size. A repurposed plastic lid breath shield was 513cm(2), was slightly curved toward the examiners face, and allowed only 2% overspray. The largest breath shield (1254 cm(2)) hung near the oculars and prevented essentially all the overspray. CONCLUSION: The performance of different designs of breath shields is variable. Even high functioning shields should be used in conjunction with personal protective equipment including masks, goggles and gloves, and handwashing.

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), making RdRp an excellent target for antiviral agents. RdRp is a multi-subunit complex composed of 3 viral proteins named nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 that ensure the ~30 kb RNA genome's transcription and replication. The main strategies employed so far for the overproduction of RdRp consist of expressing and purifying the three subunits separately before assembling the complex in vitro. However, nsp12 shows limited solubility in bacterial expression systems and is often produced in insect cells. Here, we describe an alternative strategy to co-express the full SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in E. coli, using a single plasmid. Characterization of the purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shows that it forms a complex with the expected (nsp7)(nsp8)2(nsp12) stoichiometry. RNA polymerization activity was measured using primer-extension assays showing that the purified enzyme is functional. The purification protocol can be achieved in one single day, surpassing in speed all other published protocols. Our construct is ideally suited for screening RdRp and its variants against very large chemical compounds libraries and has been made available to the scientific community through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene ID: 165451).","output":"Fast and efficient purification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase complex expressed in Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Physical distancing during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic may have unintended, detrimental effects on social isolation and loneliness among older adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and sixty\\\\one patients from February to April 2020 have been recruited. Patients were divided into three groups: (N = 50) COVID\\\\19 positive and (N = 21) COVID\\\\19 negative with molecular testing, (N = 490) as reference population without molecular testing. A Multiplex rRT\\\\PCR from samples collected by nasopharyngeal swabs was performed and the hematological data collected. RESULTS: We detected a mild anemia in COVID\\\\19 group and lymphopenia against reference population: hemoglobin (g/dL) 13.0 (11.5\\\\14.8) versus 13.9 (12.8\\\\15.0) (P = .0135); lymphocytes (10(9)/L) 1.24 (0.94\\\\1.73) versus 1.99 (1.49\\\\2.64) (P < .0001). In addition, abnormal platelet parameters as follows (COVID group vs reference population): PLT (10(9)/L) 209 (160\\\\258) vs 236 (193\\\\279) (P = .0239). IPF (%) 4.05 (2.5\\\\5.9) versus 3.4 (2.2\\\\4.9) (P = .0576); H\\\\IPF (%) 1.25 (0.8\\\\2.2) versus 0.95 (0.6\\\\1.5) (P = .0171) were identified.

We analyzed cross-sectional scores from the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET) in a cohort of N = 57 COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation, calculating the frequency of impairment based on neuropsychologist diagnosis and by age-normed BMET subtests. In total, 43 patients (75%) were male, 35 (61%) were non-white, and mean age was 64.5 (SD = 13.9) years. In total, 48 (84%) were previously living at home independently. Two patients had documented preexisting cognitive dysfunction; none had known dementia. Patients were evaluated at a mean of 43.2 (SD = 19.2) days after initial admission. In total, 50 patients (88%) had documented hypoxemic respiratory failure and 44 (77%) required intubation. Forty-six patients (81%) had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. Deficits were common in working memory (26/47 [55%] of patients), set-shifting (21/44 [47%]), divided attention (18/39 [46%]), and processing speed (14/35 [40%]). Executive dysfunction was not significantly associated with intubation length or the time from extubation to assessment, psychiatric diagnosis, or preexisting cardiovascular/metabolic disease. Attention and executive functions are frequently impaired in COVID-19 patients who require acute rehabilitation prior to discharge.

Despite having promising treatment efficacy, the fundamental neural mechanisms of TMS remain understudied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 15 healthy adult participants received simultaneous TMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging to map the modulatory effect of TMS when it was applied over three different sites in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify the networks affected by TMS when applied over the different sites. The standard general linear model (GLM) analysis was used for comparison. RESULTS: ICA showed that TMS affected the stimulation sites as well as remote brain areas, some areas/networks common across all TMS sites, and other areas/networks specific to each TMS site. In particular, TMS site and laterality differences were observed at the left executive control network. In addition, laterality differences also were observed at the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. In contrast with the ICA findings, the GLM-based results mainly showed activation of auditory cortices regardless of the TMS sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that TMS could act through a top-down mechanism, indirectly modulating deep subcortical nodes by directly stimulating cortical regions.

The primary goal was to assess the humoral immune response as measured by titres of neutralising antibodies against the S1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2. In a cross-sectional, single-centre study, titres were compared between patient subgroups with (n = 80) and without (n = 62) methotrexate exposure. MTX patients showed a significantly reduced humoral response to vaccination in the oldest patient subgroup (> 70 years: P = 0.038), whereas titres of neutralising antibodies were not significantly different between MTX and non-MTX patients in patients less than 70 years of age (< 56 years: P = 0.234; 56C70 years: P = 0.446).

As more building owners are interested in running coworking space businesses, it becomes important to understand both why a potential member chooses one space over another and how to keep existing members at a coworking site.

METHODS: Data for all patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received TCZ at our center, a 200 bed community hospital in New England, were extracted from the Electronic Medical Record, including demographics, body temperature, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), IL-6 levels, clinical severity on the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI), and clinical outcome (recovery/discharge home, partial recovery/discharge rehab, death). Results were tabulated and statistical significance of changes in indices pre- and post- TCZ assessed by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. RESULTS: 19 patients received TCZ: 16 got 400mg x1, 2 got 400 mg x2, 1 got 660 mg x1. Median age was 64 years (range: 44C94), 68% male. Mean interval from symptom onset to receiving TCZ was 11.5 days. Mean IL-6 was 145 pg/mL. Demographics, OSCI scores, and discharge status are shown in Table 1. Average daily peak temperatures (T(max)) pre- and post- TCZ were 100.7 and 98.9F, p< 0.001. Mean CRP pre- and post- were 234 and 84.6 mg/L, p=0.001 (Fig.1). Decrease in T(max) and CRP was rapid and sustained (Fig. 2, 1st 8 patients shown for clarity.). 58% had improved clinical improvement by OSCI by day 7, 68% by day 14. 7 of 19 of patients were discharged home, 6 to rehab or acute care facility, and 6 died. Table 1: Patient Demographics, Clinical Severity Score, and Discharge Status [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and evidence of Cytokine Release Syndrome, tocilizumab was associated with rapid resolution of fever and marked decline in CRP. Most patients showed improvement in clinical severity scores and no adverse reactions were noted. Tocilizumab may be useful in control of pathological inflammation in COVID-19.

To study these outcomes, the geographic differences in the planned pre-pandemic major events that took place on these dates were exploited, which is a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes. We collected daily and detailed information about the number of attendees at football (soccer) and basketball matches in addition to individuals participating in the Womens Day marches across Spain, which we merged with daily data on reported COVID-19 cases and deaths at the provincial level. Our results reveal evidence of non-negligible COVID-19 cases related to the differences in the percentage of attendees at these major events from March 6 to March 8. In a typical province, approximately 31% of the average daily reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants between mid-March and early April 2020 can be explained by the participation rate in those major events. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this implies almost five million euros (169,000 euros/day) of additional economic cost in the health system of a typical province with one million inhabitants in the period under consideration.

Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. METHODS: Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. RESULTS: Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18-91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR=1.09 [95%CI 1.07-1.12], P<.001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR=1.31 [95%CI 1.25-1.36], P<.001 in the crude model; OR=1.12 [95%CI 1.07-1.17], P<.001 in the fully adjusted model). For other disorders, associations lost significance after adjustment for cardiometabolic parameters and somatic morbidities. LIMITATIONS: Persons of non-Western descent and severely (mentally or physically) ill individuals were underrepresented.

Coagulopathy in patients with new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is important for the course and prognosis of the disease. Hypercoagulation, hyperfibrinogenemia and thrombosis are typical manifestations of coagulopathy in the acute phase of the disease. Hypofibrinogenemia in COVID-19 is not widely reported in the literature, and the frequency and reasons of its development are unknown. The use of genetically engineered biological drugs (GEBD) may be one of the possible causes of hypofibrinogenemia but the mechanisms of its development are not clear. Objectives: To determine the role of therapy with interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in the development of hypofibrinogenemia in patients with COVID-19-pneumonia, the clinical significance of hypofibrinogenemia and the mechanism of its occurrence. Patients/Methods. A randomized retrospective study included 239 patients aged 18 to 96 years with confirmed by polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 infection, computed tomography signs (upon admission to the hospital) of viral pneumonia (grade 2C4) and a duration of hospitalization of more than 2 days. All patients underwent laboratory monitoring, including the determination of hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), liver enzymes and fibrinogen according to Claus. All patients received initial therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. At the time of the study, tocilizumab was the only GEBD drug used in the hospital. Therapy with tocilizumab was performed in 164 (68.6%) patients. The study took into account the maximum and minimum values of hemoglobin, platelet, fibrinogen and CRP levels during the hospitalization. Results. Hypofibrinogenemia of varying severity was observed in 39 patients treated with tocilizumab, that was significantly higher than hypofibrinogenemia frequency in 2 patients who did not receive tocilizumab (RR = 8.9;95% CI = 2.2C25.9).

It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy.

Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. Government, Foreign Governments, Organizations, and General Public, as well as the interactions with W.H.O. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed. In total 1440 causal factors of the UCAs were identified, and 2880 requirements were proposed to avoid such unsafe interactions.","output":"Analyzing national responses to COVID-19 Pandemic using STPA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19, while questioning the coverage areas, duties, and functionality of objects that are indispensable for our lives, we see that objects destroy the weak and the design itself eliminates the non-immune and the weak in some cases.

Challenges in getting the public to accept the vaccine may be due to vaccine hesitancy which may be caused by poor knowledge, poor attitude, ethical issues and safety concerns. The study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude and factors affecting the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among traders at Edaiken market, Uselu, Benin City, Edo State. METHODS This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 400 traders using multistage sampling technique in Benin City, Edo State. A forty-one-item questionnaire was utilized to collect data. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 and quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, proportions, means and standard deviation. Level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS A higher proportion (35.2%) of respondents were aged between 20 - 29 years of age and almost three-quarters (74.0%) were females, while 48.7% were married. Almost one-third, 30% of the respondents had good knowledge of COVID-19 and 375 (93.8%) had poor knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccine. One-fifth (20.8%) of respondents had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine and 90 (22.5%) respondents did not know where to get the vaccine. CONCLUSION Knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines was poor among the respondents, with most of them displaying a negative attitude to the vaccine.

Our goal was to analyze the correlation of IL-33 and other innate immunity cytokines with disease severity. Methods: In this study, 220 patients with COVID-19 were included and divided into two groups, mild/moderate and severe/critical. The value of the cytokines, clinical, biochemical, radiographic data was collected and their correlation with disease severity was analyzed. Results: Most patients in the severe/critical group were male (81.8%) and older (over 64.5 years). We found a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in these two groups between clinical features (dyspnea, dry cough, fatigue, and auscultatory findings); laboratory [(neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, hemoglobin, plasma glucose, urea, creatinine, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase (CK), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), Fe, and Ferritin)], arterial blood gases (oxygen saturation-Sa0(2), partial pressure of oxygen -p0(2)), and chest X-rays (CXR) lung findings (p = 0.000). We found a significantly higher serum concentration (p < 0.05) of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-33 in patients with COVID-19 with severe disease. In the milder stage of COVID-19, a positive correlation was detected between IL-33 and IL-1, IL-12 and IL-23, while a stronger positive correlation between the serum values of IL-33 and TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12 and IL-23 was detected in patients with COVID-19 with severe disease. A weak negative correlation (p < 0.05) between pO(2) and serum IL-1, IL-12, and IL-33 and between SaO(2) and serum IL-33 was noted. The positive relation (p < 0.05) between the serum values of IL-33 and IL-12, IL-33 and IL-6, and IL-6 and IL-12 is proven. Conclusion: In a more progressive stage of COVID-19, increased IL-33 facilitates lung inflammation by inducing the production of various innate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IL-12, and IL-23) in several target cells leading to the most severe forms of the disease.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -3110(9)/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -2910(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -4810(9)/L; 95% CI, -57 to -3910(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6).

Various anti-inflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes, a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism C including the geroprotector drug metformin C could inhibit the inflammatory response in monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production. Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism. Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by treatments that interfere with glycolytic activation, including metformin. This has potential implications for the treatment of hyperinflammation during COVID-19, which disproportionately affects older adults.","output":"Metformin Suppresses Monocyte Inflammation and Metabolic Reprogramming by SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been altering all aspects of societal life including community mobility since December 2019.

This created significant organizational challenges including numerous non-specialist ICU caregivers who came to work in the ICU. In this context, pragmatic protocols were essential to simplify nutritional care. We aimed at providing a simple and easy-to-prescribe nutritional protocol and evaluated its usefulness with questionnaires sent to physicians involved in the care of ICU COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A simplified nutrition protocol was distributed to all physicians (n = 122) of the ICU medical team during COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical dieticians estimated energy targets for acute and post-acute phases at patient's admission and suggested adaptations of nutrition therapy. More complex situations were discussed with clinical nutrition doctors and, if required, a clinical evaluation was performed. To further facilitate the procedure, a chart with prescription aids was also distributed to the whole medical ICU team. At the end of the current pandemic wave, a 13-item questionnaire was emailed to the ICU medical team to obtain their opinion on the suggested nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Answers were received from 81/122 medical doctors (MDs) (66% response rate), from intensive care physicians (41%), anaesthesiologists (53%) and MDs from other specialties (6%). Thirty-two percent of MDs felt that their knowledge of nutrition management was insufficient and 45% of the physicians surveyed did not face nutrition management in their daily practice prior to the pandemic. The initially proposed nutritional protocol, the chart with prescription aids and the suggested nutritional proposals were considered as useful to very useful by the majority of physicians surveyed (89.9, 90.7 and 92.1% respectively). The protocol was followed by 92% of MDs, and almost all participants (95%) were convinced that adaptations of nutritional therapy had beneficial effects on patients outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients is a challenge and the implementation of this specific pandemic simplified nutritional protocol was assessed as useful by a great majority of physicians. Pragmatic and simplified protocols are useful for ensuring the quality of nutritional therapy and could be used in future studies to assess its actual impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Easy-to-prescribe nutrition support in the intensive care in the era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Diagnostics for COVID-19 detection are limited in many settings. Syndromic surveillance is often the only means to identify cases, despite lack of specificity and asymptomatic cases.

Rapid antigen tests and PCR validation was performed on 1172 syndromically-identified individuals at their households. Statistical models were fit to predict PCR status using rapid-antigen-test results, syndromic data, and their combination. Model predictive and classification performance was examined under contrasting epidemiological scenarios to evaluate their potential for improving diagnoses.Findings: Models combining rapid-antigen-test and syndromic data yielded equal performance to rapid-antigen-test-only models in the Agnostic scenario and performed better under scenarios of Low Incidence and Epidemic Growth. Under Epidemic Growth, the combined models false negative rate is 26 (IQR:24-29) percentage points lower than the rapid-antigen-test-only models, with a false positive rate <20%. Under Low Incidence the combined models false positive rate is 27 (IQR:23-32) percentage points lower than the rapid-antigen-test-only models, with a false negative rate <20%.Interpretation: Drawing on complementary strengths across two rapid diagnostics, we demonstrate improved COVID-19 detection, and reduced false-positive and -negative diagnoses to match local requirements;improvements achievable without additional expense or changes for patients or practitioners.

A majority of tumor-promoting kinase signaling pathways feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. The activation status of ERK1/2 during invasion of MB cells is not known and its implication in invasion control unclear. We established a synthetic kinase activation relocation sensor (SKARS) for the MAPK ERK1/2 pathway in MB cells for real-time measuring of drug response. We used 3D invasion assays and organotypic cerebellum slice culture to test drug effects in a physiologically relevant tissue environment. We found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused rapid nuclear ERK1/2 activation in MB cells, which persisted for several hours. Concomitant treatment with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib completely repressed nuclear ERK1/2 activity induced by HGF and EGF but not by bFGF. Increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity correlated positively with speed of invasion. Dasatinib blocked ERK-associated invasion in the majority of cells, but we also observed fast-invading cells with low ERK1/2 activity. These ERK1/2-low, fast-moving cells displayed a rounded morphology, while ERK-high fast-moving cells displayed a mesenchymal morphology. Dasatinib effectively blocked EGF-induced proliferation while it only moderately repressed tissue invasion, indicating that a subset of cells may evade invasion repression by dasatinib through non-mesenchymal motility. Thus, growth factor-induced nuclear activation of ERK1/2 is associated with mesenchymal motility and proliferation in MB cells and can be blocked with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib.","output":"Real-time sensing of MAPK signaling in medulloblastoma cells reveals cellular evasion mechanism counteracting dasatinib blockade of ERK activation during invasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality.

In this report, we show that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein mediates viral entry through pH-dependent endocytosis.

The S glycoprotein was used successfully to pseudotype replication-defective retroviral and lentiviral vectors that readily infected Vero cells as well as primary pulmonary and renal epithelial cells from human, nonhuman primate, and, to a lesser extent, feline species. The tropism of this reporter virus was similar to that of wild-type, replication-competent SARS-CoV, and binding of purified S to susceptible target cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Although myeloid dendritic cells were able to interact with S and to bind virus, these cells could not be infected by SARS-CoV. However, these cells were able to transfer the virus to susceptible target cells through a synapse-like structure. Both cell-mediated infection and direct infection were inhibited by anti-S antisera, indicating that strategies directed toward this gene product are likely to confer a therapeutic benefit for antiviral drugs or the development of a SARS vaccine.","output":"pH-dependent entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is mediated by the spike glycoprotein and enhanced by dendritic cell transfer through DC-SIGN."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological tests play an essential role in monitoring and combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Studies with an observational design that evaluated the association between the dTAC and common mental disorders and sleep disorders were identified using the PubMed and Scopus databases. The meta-analysis guideline of observational studies in epidemiology and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis were used to conduct and report the data of this systematic review. Results Of the 439 records, seven studies were included in this review. There was a sample variation of 41-3297 participants. We highlight that five of the studies analyzed were conducted in the Iranian population. Four studies analyzed only women, and three studies were conducted with postmenopausal or climacteric women. Four cross-sectional studies showed inverse associations between the dTAC and depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in Iranians. Conclusion The consumption of a diet rich in antioxidants, characterized by high dTAC scores, seems to be inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. However, further studies with different populations and designs are necessary for a better understand this relationship. Relevance to Patients This review assesses the association of the dTAC with common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) with sleep disorders. This will help guide further studies on the relationship between diet and mental disorders and sleep disorders. Knowledge about these relationships is essential for the creation of non-pharmacological practices for the prevention of these disorders.","output":"Association of dietary total antioxidant capacity with depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders: A systematic review of observational studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a formal mathematical modeling framework for a multi-agent sequential decision problem during an epidemic. The problem is formulated as a collaboration between a vaccination agent and learning agent to allocate stockpiles of vaccines and tests to a set of zones under various types of uncertainty. The model is able to capture passive information processes and maintain beliefs over the uncertain state of the world. We designed a parameterized direct lookahead approximation which is robust and scalable under different scenarios, resource scarcity, and beliefs about the environment. We design a test allocation policy designed to capture the value of information and demonstrate that it outperforms other learning policies when there is an extreme shortage of resources (information is scarce). We simulate the model with two scenarios including a resource allocation problem to each state in the United States and another for the nursing homes in Nevada. The US example demonstrates the scalability of the model and the nursing home example demonstrates the robustness under extreme resource shortages.","output":"Stochastic Optimization for Vaccine and Testing Kit Allocation for the COVID-19 Pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Containment of the coronavirus pandemic relied extensively on the combination of early implementation of quarantine and massive behavioral changes to ensure effectiveness. Decision-makers need to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Yet little is known about the factors influencing adherence and understanding of lockdown measures among the Palestinian community. This study aimed to assess the impact and factors affecting these early public health interventions. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram). We used a snowball recruiting technique to target Palestinian adult citizens during the coronavirus pandemic quarantine between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to almost the middle interval of the strict massive lockdown measures in Palestine that lasted from 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed for the outcome variables (staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding). Results: Our questionnaire was completed by 2,819 participants. The mean (range) age was 29.47 (18C71) years. Of them, 1,144 (40.6%), 1,261 (44.7%), and 1,283 (45.5%) reported low levels of staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding, respectively. Females, city residents, those with higher educational levels, and those informed by official government sources were associated significantly with higher levels of both staying home adherence and quarantine understanding. Adequate food supply was associated with a higher level of staying home adherence. Higher levels of in-home precautions adherence were noticed in the elderly and those with a high-risk group living at home. Higher monthly income was inversely associated with higher levels of in-home precautions adherence and lower levels of quarantine understanding (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The socio-economic and financial status of the general population and coordination between the major information resources (official government), social media, and the press were the major factors affecting the community in regard to quarantine adherence. For maximum effectiveness and commitment levels amongst the people to decrease the spread of infection, policymakers need to address all those factors. In addition, clear communication between policymakers and the population is essential for reassuring the people and minimizing their fears regarding the unknown future.","output":"Assessment of Quarantine Understanding and Adherence to Lockdown Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Palestine: Community Experience and Evidence for Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group proposed that it is ethical to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials in countries where vaccines are not available even if this vaccine is marketed and being used elsewhere. The reason for this proposal is the usual scientific argument claiming that these trials are the most efficient method to obtain reliable results, and individuals in these countries will continue to get the local standard of care, meaning no vaccination, and thus participants are not being left worse off. We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative.

Early reports seem to indicate that the pandemic may have had a negative effect on software developers, socially and personally, but that their software development productivity may not have been negatively impacted. Aims: Early reports about the effects of the pandemic on software development focused on software developers well-being and on their productivity as employees. We are interested in a different aspect of software development: The developers public contributions, as seen in GitHub and Stack Overflow activities. Did the pandemic affect the developers public contributions and, of so, in what way? Method: Considering the data from between 2017 and till 2020, we study the trends within GitHubs push, create, pull request, and release events, and within Stack Overflows new users, posts, votes, and comments. We performed linear regressions, correlation analyses, outlier analyses, hypothesis testing, and we also contacted individual developers in order to gather qualitative insights about their unusual public contributions. Results: Our study shows that within GitHub and Stack Overflow, the onset of the pandemic (March/April 2020) is reflected in a set of outliers in developers contributions that point to an increase in activity. The distributions of contributions during the entire year of 2020 were, in some aspects, different, but, in other aspects, similar from the recent past. Additionally, we found one noticeably disrupted pattern of contribution in Stack Overflow, namely the ratio Questions/Answers, which was much higher in 2020 than before. Testimonials from the developers we contacted were mixed: while some developers reported that their increase in activity was due to the pandemic, others reported that it was not. Conclusion: In Github, there was a noticeable increase in public software development activity in 2020, as well as more abrupt changes in daily activities;in Stack Overflow, there was a noticeable increase in new users and new questions at the onset of the pandemic, and in the ratio of Questions/Answers during 2020. The results may be attributed to the pandemic, but other factors could have come into play. ? 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

We aimed to determine whether stable preterm infants could maintain thermoregulation for 48 h in a low-cost incubator (LCI). METHODS: The LCI was constructed using a servo-heater costing 200 USD and cardboard infant-chamber. We conducted this open-labeled non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in a tertiary level teaching hospital in India from May 2017 to March 2018. Preterm infants on full feeds and receiving incubator or radiant warmer care were enrolled at 32 to 36 weeks post-menstrual age. We enrolled 96 infants in two strata (Strata-1< 33 weeks, Strata-2  33 weeks at birth). Infants were randomized to LCI or standard single-wall incubator (SSI) after negative incubator cultures and monitored for 48 h in air-mode along with kangaroo mother care. The incubator temperature was adjusted manually to maintain skin and axillary temperatures between 36.5 C and 37.5 C. During post-infant period after 48 h, SSI and LCI worked for 5 days and incubator temperatures were measured. The primary outcome was maintenance of skin and axillary temperatures with a non-inferiority margin of 0.2 C. Failed thermoregulation was defined as abnormal axillary temperature (< 36.5 C or >37.5 C) for > 30 continuous-minutes. Secondary outcomes were incidence of hypothermia and required incubator temperature. Trial registration details: Clinical Trial Registry - India (CTRI/2015/10/006316). FINDINGS: Prior to enrollment 79(82%) infants were in radiant warmer and 17(18%) infants were in incubator care. Median weight at enrollment in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 1355(IQR 1250C1468) vs. 1415(IQR 1280C1582) and 1993(IQR 1595C2160) vs. 1995(IQR 1632C2237) grams. Mean skin temperature in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 36.8 C  0.2 vs. 36.7 C  0.18 and 36.8 C  0.22 vs. 36.7 C  0.19. Mean axillary temperature in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 36.9 C  0.19 vs. 36.8 C  0.16 and 36.8 C  0.2 vs. 36.8 C  0.19. Mixed-effect model done for repeated measures of skin and axillary temperatures showed the estimates were within the non-inferiority limit; -0.07 C (95% CI -0.11 to -0.04) and -0.06 C (95% CI -0.095 to -0.02), respectively. Failed thermoregulation did not occur in any infants. Mild hypothermia occurred in 11 of 48(23%) of SSI and 16 of 48(33%) of LCI, OR 1.28 (95%CI 0.85 to 1.91). Incubator temperature in LCI was higher by 0.7 C (95%CI 0.52 to 0.91). In the post-infant period SSI and LCI had excellent reliability to maintain set-temperature with intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95%CI 0.92 to 0.94) and 0.96 (95%CI 0.96 to 0.97), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Maintenance of skin and axillary temperature of stable preterm infants in LCI along with kangaroo mother care was non-inferior to SSI, but at a higher incubator temperature by 0.7 C. No adverse events occurred and LCI had excellent reliability to maintained set-temperature.

These restrictive measures have an enormous impact on residents' well-being and pose dilemmas for staff, although primary data are lacking. A Dutch guideline was developed to cautiously open nursing homes for visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the first findings on how the guideline was applied in the local context; the compliance to local protocols; and the impact on well-being of residents, their family caregivers, and staff. DESIGN: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 26 nursing homes were permitted to enlarge their possibilities for allowing visitors in their facility. These nursing homes were proportionally representative of the Netherlands as they were selected by their local Area Health Authority for participation. At each nursing home, a contact person was selected for participation in the current study. METHODS: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted, consisting of questionnaire, telephone interviews, analyses of documentation (ie, local visiting protocols), and a WhatsApp group. RESULTS: Variation in local protocols was observed, for example, related to the use of personal protective equipment, location, and supervision of visits. In general, experiences were very positive. All nursing homes recognized the added value of real and personal contact between residents and their loved ones and indicated a positive impact on well-being. Compliance with local guidelines was sufficient to good. No new COVID-19 infections were reported during this time.

This sudden switch from face-to-face teaching to online format prompted appropriate faculty training by the institutions. A university in Saudi Arabia organized a faculty development program to train its educators to design and implement a virtual classroom using the flipped teaching (FT) method. The flipped classroom is a student-centered instructional design where students are expected to learn basic concepts on their own using resources provided by the instructor outside of class. The class time is used to rehearse and master this knowledge through discussion and application. Moving lectures outside of class allows opportunity to engage students with the content using student-centered activities during class where more interaction between the faculty and students as well as among peers is expected. The present study tested the effectiveness of a remote faculty training program at an international institution in the development of their own remote flipped courses. The training was stretched over six biweekly sessions for which a course was created on Moodle, the Learning Management System. The participants (n=13) were guided to develop pre-class assignments such as lecture videos, formative assessments to encourage students in pre-class preparation, in-class student engagement activities, and assessments. The faculty participants were given a pre- and a post-training survey to learn about their knowledge, attitude, and confidence towards FT. The pre-course survey results indicated that 62% of the participants had never tried FT and about 46% were not familiar with FT prior to receiving training while only 54% felt ready to flip. However, all participants intended to implement the FT method after completing the course. Following the training, all participants reportedly felt they could confidently flip their courses and implement FT strategies. All participants valued the training and hoped to reconvene monthly as a group to continue meeting as a group to share their remote FT experiences. In conclusion, the virtual FT training helped improve the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and confidence of all participants in designing their flipped courses to engage students in the remote teaching mode.","output":"A Virtual International Faculty Development Design to Provide Remote Flipped Teaching Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Covid-19 pandemic began in the end of 2019 and spread all over the world in a short duration of time.

CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions.

Methods Here we describe the phenotypic and functional characteristics of B and T cells in hospitalised COVID-19 patients during acute disease and at 3-6 months of convalescence. Findings We report that the alterations in B cell subsets observed in acute COVID-19 patients were largely recovered in convalescent patients. In contrast, T cells from convalescent patients displayed continued alterations with persistence of a cytotoxic programme evident in CD8+ T cells as well as elevated production of type-1 cytokines and IL-17. Interestingly, B cells from patients with acute COVID-19 displayed an IL-6/IL-10 cytokine imbalance in response to toll-like receptor activation, skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Whereas the frequency of IL-6+ B cells was restored in convalescent patients irrespective of clinical outcome, recovery of IL-10+ B cells was associated with resolution of lung pathology. Conclusions Our data detail lymphocyte alterations in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 6 months following hospital discharge and identify 3 subgroups of convalescent patients based on distinct lymphocyte phenotypes, with one subgroup associated with poorer clinical outcome. We propose that alterations in B and T cell function following hospitalisation with COVID-19 could impact longer term immunity and contribute to some persistent symptoms observed in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

The authors examined re-treatment rates after treatment with PED alone versus PED and adjunctive coil embolization (PED/coil). METHODS The authors retrospectively examined cerebral aneurysms treated with the PED from May 2011 to March 2014. Overall, 133 patients (25 men, 108 women; mean age 60.4 years, range 23-85 years) were treated for 140 aneurysms (mean size 11.8  8.3 mm) requiring 224 PEDs (mean 1.7 PEDs per patient). Sixty-eight patients (13 men, 55 women) were treated with PED alone for 73 aneurysms (mean size 10.6  9.2 mm) and 65 patients (12 men, 53 women) were treated with PED/coil for 67 aneurysms (mean size 12.8  7.4 mm). RESULTS Eight aneurysms in 8 patients were re-treated in the PED-alone cohort versus only 1 aneurysm in 1 patient in the PED/coil cohort for re-treatment rates of 11.8% (8/68) and 1.5% (1/65), respectively (p = 0.03). Two patients in the PED-alone cohort were re-treated due to PED contraction, while the other 6 were re-treated for persistent filling of the aneurysms.

Cytokines and chemokines are recognized as key actors in the pathogenesis of COPD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between viral infection and host cytokine responses in 57 COPD patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation. Seventeen cytokines were profiled using a Luminex-Biorad multiplex assay in plasma samples collected in the first 24 h following hospital admission. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed, taking into account the influence of seven potential confounding factors in the results. Twenty-four out of 57 showed radiological signs of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at hospital admission, 25 patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), 20 had a bacterial infection, and 20 showed a detectable respiratory virus in pharyngeal swabs. Regression analysis showed that viral infection correlated with higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (log value of the coefficient of regression B, p=0.47, 0.044), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (p=0.43, 0.019), and increased admission to the ICU. Viral infection also correlated with higher levels of interferon- (IFN-) (p=0.70, 0.026), which, in turn, was inversely associated with the severity of illness. Finally, viral infection was independently associated with higher levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) (p=0.40, 0.002). Thus our study demonstrates that in patients with COPD exacerbations, viral infection is directly associated with higher systemic levels of cytokines central to the development of the antiviral response, which are also known to contribute to inflammation-mediated tissue damage. These results reveal a potential specific role of viral infection in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.","output":"Viral infection is associated with an increased proinflammatory response in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with painful varicose veins and venous insufficiency can be treated by eliminating axial reflux only or by eliminating axial reflux plus phlebectomy with transilluminated powered phlebectomy. This study was undertaken with the aim of determining and improving signs and symptoms of venous disease (measured by venous clinical severity score) and complications (by routine surveillance ultrasound and long-term post-operative follow up) for each treatment strategy. METHODS We performed a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from 979 limbs undergoing procedures for significant varicose veins and venous insufficiency from March 2008 until June 2014 performed at a single tertiary referral hospital. Patient demographics, Clinical Etiology Anatomy and Pathophysiology classification, venous clinical severity scores pre- and post-procedure, treatment chosen, and peri-operative complications were collected; descriptive statistics were calculated and unadjusted surgical outcomes for patients stratified by the procedure performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between procedure type and thrombotic complications after adjusting for patient characteristics, severity of disease, pre-operative anticoagulation, and post-operative compression. RESULT Venous clinical severity scores improved more with radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared to radiofrequency ablation alone (3.8  3.4 vs. 3.2  3.1, p = 0.018). Regarding deep venous thrombosis, there was no significant difference between radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy vs. radiofrequency ablation alone. There was no statistical difference in asymptomatic endovenous heat-induced thrombosis or infection, although there were slightly more hematomas and cases of asymptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis with combined therapy. On multivariable analysis, only procedure type predicted thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION Ablation of axial reflux plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy produces improved outcomes as measured by venous clinical severity score, with slight increases in minor post-operative complications and should be strongly considered as initial therapy when patients present with significant symptomatic varicose veins and superficial venous insufficiency. Implementation of a standardized thromboprophylaxis protocol with individual risk assessment results in few significant thrombotic complications amongst high-risk patients, thus potentially obviating the need for routine post-operative duplex.","output":"Outcomes associated with ablation compared to combined ablation and transilluminated powered phlebectomy in the treatment of venous varicosities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID- 19) no es ajena a la prctica de los otorrinolaringlogos, que a menudo estn en contacto con secreciones nasales y de cavidad oral, lo que representa un alto riesgo de infeccin Por lo tanto, es necesario conocer el uso adecuado del equipo de proteccin personal (EPP) en el mbito intrahospitalario y de consulta externa Por este motivo, se realiz una revisin narrativa de la literatura donde se expone la evidencia disponible actualizada a la fecha de esta revisin (marzo de 2020) y se proponen lineamientos y estrategias para el desarrollo de actividades para el otorrinolaringlogo en los mbitos mencionados Aunque la informacin disponible est en constante evolucin, se pretende que este documento sea una gua que pueda aplicarse por parte de todos los especialistas, el personal mdico en formacin (pregrado y postgrado) y dems personal de salud (enfermera, audiologa y fonoaudiologa) que participa en la atencin de pacientes en el rea de otorrinolaringologa","output":"Lineamientos y estrategia de la consulta externa y mbito hospitalario para el otorrinolaringlogo en tiempos de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) usually causes a mild illness among children.

The RNA expression patterns of RMRP, miR-3142 and TRIB3 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Levels of apoptosis- or autophagy-associated biomarkers and TRIB3 level were evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting or immunofluorescence assays, respectively. Bioinformatics methods and luciferase assays were used to predict and validate the interactions among RMRP, miR-3142, and TRIB3. Flow cytometry, TUNEL staining and EdU assays were used to examine the apoptosis and proliferation of neurons, respectively. RESULTS: The elevated RMRP and TRIB3 expressions and activation of autophagy were observed in AD. Knockdown of RMRP restrained neuronal apoptosis and autophagy activation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TRIB3 overexpression reversed the biological effects of RMRP silencing on A?1-42-induced cell apoptosis and autophagy. Further mechanistic analysis showed RMRP acted as a sponge of miR-3142 to elevate TRIB3 level.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by ac), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy &#8805; 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","output":"Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore potential inhibitors of viral enzymes of SARS CoV-2","output":"Teicoplanin is a potential inhibitor of SARS CoV-2 replication enzymes: a docking study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As well as severe immunosuppression, other predisposing factors may facilitate invasive mycosis caused by molds.

The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the spike precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons (IFNs) and, more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2, rather than IFITM3, and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Importantly, removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH and cathepsin dependent in late endosomes, where, like SARS-CoV-1 spike, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we found that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests that therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs. IMPORTANCE The furin cleavage site in the spike protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals, compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2 and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site, which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest that one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus, it may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.","output":"The Polybasic Cleavage Site in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Modulates Viral Sensitivity to Type I Interferon and IFITM2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the growth of COVID-19 pandemic, SMEs are facing greater uncertainties and pressures to survive because even though they are efficiently managed, their human resource organizations lack a large number of resources and a well-developed training system to foster the sustainable development of employees.

Direct-to-consumer(DTC) telemedicine has been proposed as one way to increase access, yet little is known about its pre-pandemic use for mental healthcare. OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients, providers, and their use of a large nationwide DTC telemedicine platform for mental healthcare. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: Mental health encounters conducted on the American Well DTC telemedicine platform from 2016 to 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and physicians. MAIN MEASURES: Patient measures included demographics, insurance report, and number of visits. Provider characteristics included specialty, region, and number of encounters. Encounter measures included wait time, visit length and timing, out-of-pocket payment, coupon use, prescription outcome, referral receipt, where care otherwise would have been sought, and patient satisfaction. Factors associated with five-star physician ratings and prescription receipt were assessed using logistic regression. KEY RESULTS: We analyzed 19,270 mental health encounters between 6708 patients and 1045 providers. Visits were most frequently for anxiety (39.1%) or depression (32.5%), with high satisfaction (4.9/5) across conditions. Patients had a median 2.0 visits for psychiatry (IQR 1.0C3.0) and therapy (IQR 1.0C5.0), compared to 1.0 visit (IQR 1.0C1.0) for urgent care. High satisfaction was positively correlated with prescription receipt (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.54C2.32) and after-hours timing (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02C1.36). Prescription rates ranged from 79.6% for depression to 32.2% for substance use disorders. Prescription receipt was associated with increased visit frequency (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.57C2.42 for  3 visits). CONCLUSIONS: As the burden of psychiatric disease grows, DTC telemedicine offers one solution for extending access to mental healthcare. While most encounters were one-off, evidence of some continuity in psychiatry and therapy visitsas well as overall high patient satisfactionsuggests potential for broader DTC telemental health use.

To the best of our knowledge, the microbial changes associated with aging have not yet been investigated in Singapore adults. We conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal and saliva samples, as well as fecal metabolomics to characterize the gut and oral microbial communities of 62 healthy adult male Singaporeans, including 32 young subjects (age, 23.1  1.4 years) and 30 elderly subjects (age, 69.0  3.5 years). We identified 8 gut and 13 oral species that were differentially abundant in elderly compared to young subjects. By combining the gut and oral microbiomes, 25 age-associated oral-gut species connections were identified. Moreover, oral bacteria Acidaminococcus intestine and Flavonifractor plautii were less prevalent/abundant in elderly gut samples than in young gut samples, whereas Collinsella aerofaciens and Roseburia hominis showed the opposite trends. These results indicate the varied gut-oral communications with aging. Subsequently, we expanded the association studies on microbiome, metabolome and host phenotypic parameters. In particular, Eubacterium eligens increased in elderly compared to young subjects, and was positively correlated with triglycerides, which implies that the potential role of E. eligens in lipid metabolism is altered during the aging process. Our results demonstrated aging-associated changes in the gut and oral microbiomes, as well as the connections between metabolites and host-microbe interactions, thereby deepening the understanding of alterations in the human microbiome during the aging process in a Singapore population.","output":"Integrative multiomics analysis reveals host-microbe-metabolite interplays associated with the aging process in Singaporeans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is speculated that bats are important reservoir hosts for numerous viruses, with 27 viral families reportedly detected in bats.

Excess dietary sodium contributes to cardiovascular disease risk and requires intervention at a population level. This study aimed to quantify the impact of several salt reduction initiatives on population health over a 30-year horizon using GeoDEMOS, a population model from Singapore. Four interventions were modelled in four demographic groups in 2020 for a total of 16 intervention scenarios. The effect of 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 g/day reductions in daily salt consumption, along with adherence to the World Health Organization guidelines of a maximum of 5.0 g of salt each day, was modelled in the entire population, including the overweight and obese, the elderly, and diabetics. In each scenario, the number of averted incident cases of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, along with the disability-adjusted life years up to 2050, was monitored. We found 4.0 g/day reductions in salt consumption were the most effective when implemented across the entire population, resulting in 24,000 averted incident cases of cardiovascular disease and 215,000 disability-adjusted life years over 30 years. This is a large figure when compared with the 29,200 projected annual incident cases of cardiovascular disease in 2050. When targeted at specific high-risk demographic groups, the largest effects were observed in the overweight and obese, with the same intervention yielding 10,500 averted incident cases of cardiovascular disease and 91,500 disability-adjusted life years. Quantifying the benefits of salt reduction initiatives revealed a significant impact when administered across the entire population or the overweight and obese.

While self-attention deep convolutional neural network architectures in existing literature center around the notion of multiple isolated lightweight attention mechanisms with limited individual capacities being incorporated at different points in the network architecture, MEDUSA takes a significant departure from this notion by possessing a single, unified self-attention mechanism with significantly higher capacity with multiple attention heads feeding into different scales in the network architecture.

Several studies have noted that the majority of people in sub-Saharan African are noncompliant with proposed health and safety measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective country health departments. In most sub-Saharan African countries, noncompliance is attributable to ignorance and misinformation, thereby raising questions about people's knowledge, attitudes, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 in these settings. This situation is particularly of concern for governments and public health experts. Thus, this scoping review is aimed at mapping evidence on the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and preventive practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: Systematic searches of relevant articles were performed using databases such as the EBSCOhost, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, the WHO library and grey literature. Arksey and O'Malley's framework guided the study. The risk of bias for included primary studies was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). NVIVO version 10 was used to analyse the data and a thematic content analysis was used to present the review's narrative account. RESULTS: A total of 3037 eligible studies were identified after the database search. Only 28 studies met the inclusion criteria after full article screening and were included for data extraction. Studies included populations from the following SSA countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Sierra Leone.

Investigations on inhibitory/facilitatory modulation of vision, touch and pain show that conditioning stimuli outside the receptive field of testing stimuli modulate the central processing of visual, touch and painful stimuli. We asked whether contextual modulation also exists in human temperature integration. What is the main finding and its importance? Progressive decreases in whole-body mean skin temperature (the conditioning stimulus) significantly increased local thermosensitivity to skin warming but not cooling (the testing stimuli) in a dose-dependent fashion. In resembling the central mechanisms underlying endogenous analgesia, our findings point to the existence of an endogenous thermosensory system in humans that could modulate local skin thermal sensitivity to facilitate thermal behaviour. Although inhibitory/facilitatory central modulation of vision and pain has been investigated, contextual modulation of skin temperature integration has not been explored. Hence, we tested whether progressive decreases in whole-body mean skin temperature (Tsk ; a large conditioning stimulus) alter the magnitude estimation of local warming and cooling stimuli applied to hairy and glabrous skin. On four separate occasions, eight men (27  5 years old) underwent a 30 min whole-body cooling protocol (water-perfused suit; temperature, 5C), during which a quantitative thermosensory test, consisting of reporting the perceived magnitude of warming and cooling stimuli (8C from 30C baseline) applied to the hand (palm/dorsum) and foot (sole/dorsum), was performed before cooling and every 10 min thereafter. The cooling protocol resulted in large progressive reductions in Tsk [10 min, -3.36C (95% confidence interval -2.62 to -4.10); 20 min, -5.21C (-4.47 to -5.95); and 30 min, -6.32C (-5.58 to -7.05); P < 0.001], with minimal changes (0.08C) in rectal temperature. While thermosensitivity to local skin cooling remained unchanged (P = 0.831), sensitivity to skin warming increased significantly at each level of Tsk for all skin regions [10 min, +4.9% (-1.1 to +11.0); 20 min, +6.1% (+0.1-12.2); and 30 min, +7.9% (+1.9-13.9); P = 0.009]. Linear regression indicated a 1.2% C-1 increase in warm thermosensitivity with whole-body skin cooling. Overall, large decreases in Tsk significantly facilitated warm but not cold sensory processing of local thermal stimuli, in a dose-dependent fashion. In highlighting a novel feature of human temperature integration, these findings point to the existence of an endogenous thermosensory system that could modulate local skin thermal sensitivity in relationship to whole-body thermal states.","output":"Warm hands, cold heart: progressive whole-body cooling increases warm thermosensitivity of human hands and feet in a dose-dependent fashion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare systems globally have been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating the reorganization of surgical services to free capacity within healthcare systems. Objectives: To understand how surgical services have been reorganized during and following public health emergencies, and the consequences of these changes for patients, healthcare providers and healthcare systems. Methods: This rapid scoping review searched academic databases and grey literature sources to identify studies examining surgical service delivery during public health emergencies including COVID-19, and the impact on patients, providers and healthcare systems. Recommendations and guidelines were excluded. Screening was completed in partial (title, abstract) or complete (full text) duplicate following pilot reviews of 50 articles to ensure reliable application of eligibility criteria. Results: One hundred and thirty-two studies were included in this review; 111 described reorganization of surgical services, 55 described the consequences of reorganizing surgical services and six reported actions taken to rebuild surgical capacity in public health emergencies. Reorganizations of surgical services were grouped under six domains: case selection/triage, PPE regulations and practice, workforce composition and deployment, outpatient and inpatient patient care, resident and fellow education, and the hospital or clinical environment. Service reorganizations led to large reductions in non-urgent surgical volumes, increases in surgical wait times, and impacted medical training (i.e., reduced case involvement) and patient outcomes (e.g., increases in pain). Strategies for rebuilding surgical capacity were scarce, but focused on the availability of staff, PPE, and patient readiness for surgery as key factors to consider before resuming services. Conclusions: Reorganization of surgical services in response to public health emergencies appears to be context-dependent and has far-reaching consequences that must be better understood in order to optimize future health system responses to public health emergencies.","output":"Surgery & COVID-19: A rapid scoping review of the impact of COVID-19 on surgical services during public health emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is observed by hyperinflammation and cytokine storm. The spectrum of severity ranged from standard hospitalization to pediatric intensive care unit management. There is no specific activity score that predicts whether this hyperinflammatory state will be severe or result in mortality in pediatric patients. There are activity scores used in KD and other vasculitis such as Kobayashi score (KS) and Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) that determine the severity of the disease in children. Objectives: Based on the clinical similarity of MIS-C to these disease groups, we wanted to evaluate the performance of these disease activity scores. Also, we aimed to identify the factors associated with the disease severity of patients with MISC Methods: We retrospectively enrolled a single-center cohort of 45 consecutive pediatric patients with MISC admitted to Umraniye Training and Resrach Hospital, Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic, Istanbul, Turkey, from April 20 to December 31, 2020. Medical information of each patient including demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and outcomes was extracted retrospectively through review of electronic medical records. We analyzed all score systems including KS, PVAS, NLR, cHIS, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) as assessment factors for diagnosis for severe disease and evaluation of disease activity in MISC. All scores were compared between two groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic utility. Results: We reported 45 patients (10 female, 35male) with MISC. Their mean age was 9.654.93 years (7 months-18 years). All patients had fever (median 4 days), 71 % patients had acute gastrointestinal symptoms, 37.8 % of patient's conjunctivitis and only 5 patients had respiratory findings at admission. Twenty-four (46.7%) patients met criteria for classic KD. Macrophage activation syndrome and myocardial dysfunction with or without cardiogenic shock were seen 14 and 10 patients respectively. All the patients had positive serology for SARSCoV-2, abnormal complete blood counts and coagulation tests, and elevated inflammatory markers. We divided the disease severity into a moderate or severe group based on admission on intensive care unit (ICU). There were 15 patients with severe illness (33%). The median age of these patients was significantly older (11.3 years vs 9.16 years, p=0.05). The median hospital stay period was 10 days. The median need for intensive care was on the first day (1-14th days), and the median lasted 5 (1-9) days. The majority of MISC patients were on Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (89%), and corticosteroid (73.3%). A total of 12 patients received anakinra. In the severe group, all patients had higher values of KD, PVAS, NLR, cHIS, and CAR than the patients in moderate group. For severe MISC, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.864 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.729-1) for the PVAS, 0.911 (95% CI, 0.827-0.995) for the NLR, and 0.853 (95% CI, 0.744-0.963) for the CAR, with optimal cut-off values of 3.5, 9.05, and 4.86, respectively. Thirty-eight (84.4%) of the 45 patients met two or more cHIS criteria at the time of their hospitalization;39% of these patients were identified as severe group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.27-2.13, p=0.04).

METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.

In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics.

The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores.

Many machine learning methods have been proposed for the computer-aided diagnosis between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Most of these methods utilized the location-specific handcrafted features based on the segmentation results to improve the diagnose performance. However, the prerequisite segmentation step is time-consuming and needs the intervention by lots of expert radiologists, which cannot be achieved in the areas with limited medical resources. METHODS: We propose a generative adversarial feature completion and diagnosis network (GACDN) that simultaneously generates handcrafted features by radiomic counterparts and makes accurate diagnoses based on both original and generated features. Specifically, we first calculate the radiomic features from the CT images. Then, in order to fast obtain the location-specific handcrafted features, we use the proposed GACDN to generate them by its corresponding radiomic features. Finally, we use both radiomic features and location-specific handcrafted features for COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: For the performance of our generated location-specific handcrafted features, the results of four basic classifiers show that it has an average of 3.21% increase in diagnoses accuracy. Besides, the experimental results on COVID-19 dataset show that our proposed method achieved superior performance in COVID-19 vs. community acquired pneumonia (CAP) classification compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The absence of a medical device to carry out these measurements remotely is one of the main limitations of telemedicine. Remote photoplethysmography imaging (rPPG) makes it possible to use a camera video to measure some of the most valuable physiological variables: heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Our objective was to evaluate the value of such remote measurements compared with existing contact point measurements techniques in real-life clinical settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective hospital-based study that will recruit 1045 patients who require a pulmonary function test. For each patient, measurements of HR, RR and SpO(2), using a standard acquisition system, will be carried out concomitantly with the measurements made by the rPPG system. 30, 60 and 120 s time frames will be used to take measurements. Age, gender and skin phototype will also be collected. The intraclass coefficient correlation will be performed to determine the accuracy and precision of the rPPG algorithm readings.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association of allergic disorders with the likelihood of a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, and death). METHODS: A propensity-score-matched nationwide cohort study was performed in South Korea. Data obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea from all adult patients (age, >20 years) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, were analyzed. The association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and allergic diseases in the entire cohort (n = 219,959) and the difference in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with allergic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n = 7,340). RESULTS: In the entire cohort, patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing were evaluated to ascertain whether asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. After propensity score matching, we found that asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Patients with nonallergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 than patients with allergic asthma.

Only studies composed by adolescents (10 to 19 years old) that evaluated the CMD prevalence according to the GHQ-12 were considered. The studies were searched in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Adolec, Google Scholar, PsycINFO and Proquest. In addition, the reference lists of relevant reports were screened to identify potentially eligible articles. Studies were selected by independent reviewers, who also extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed to summarize the prevalence of CMD and estimate heterogeneity across studies. A total of 43 studies were included. Among studies that adopted the cut-off point of 3, the prevalence of CMD was 31.0% (CI 95% 28.0-34.0; I2 = 97.5%) and was more prevalent among girls. In studies that used the cut-off point of 4, the prevalence of CMD was 25.0% (CI 95% 19.0-32.0; I2 = 99.8%). Global prevalence of CMD in adolescents was 25.0% and 31.0%, using the GHQ cut-off point of 4 and 3, respectively.

The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among the physically active Sicilian population before and during the last seven days of the COVID-19 quarantine. Furthermore, the relation between this parameter and specific demographic and anthropometric variables was analyzed. Methods: 802 Sicilian physically active participants (mean age: 32.27  12.81 years; BMI: 23.44  3.33 kg/m2) were included in the study and grouped based on gender, age and BMI. An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was administered to the participants through an online survey. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results: As expected, we observed a significant decrease of the total weekly energy expenditure during the COVID-19 quarantine (p < 0.001). A significant variation in the MET-min/wk in the before quarantine condition (p = 0.046) and in the difference between before and during quarantine (p = 0.009) was found for males and females. The male group decreased the PA level more than the female one. Moreover, a significant difference in the MET-min/wk was found among groups distributions of BMI (p < 0.001, during quarantine) and of age (p < 0.001, both before and during quarantine). In particular, the highest and the lowest levels of PA were reported by the young and the elderly, respectively, both before and during quarantine. Finally, the overweight group showed the lowest level of PA during quarantine. Conclusion: Based on our outcomes, we can determine that the current quarantine has negatively affected the practice of PA, with greater impacts among males and overweight subjects.

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. MethodsTwo hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patients prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. ResultsOf 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. ConclusionOlder age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients. SummaryIn this hospital-based case-cohort study, we found that serum urea nitrogen, TBIL, LDH and AST/ALT ratio, several markers of extrapulmonary organ injuries, were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. We provide evidence for the first time that multiple organ damage on admission influences the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virusCmiRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.","output":"MiR-10a-5p-Mediated Syndecan 1 Suppression Restricts Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the global pandemic are wide spreading.

The attitudes of hospitals toward welcoming families in this respect have improved. In Arab culture, the main core of society is considered to be the family, not the individual. The objective behind involving family in patient care is to meet patients support needs. Consequently, this involvement affects nurses and their attitudes toward the importance of family involvement in patient care. Objectives: To describe nurses and nursing students perceptions of family involvement in the care of hospitalized adult patients in Saudi Arabia. Design: This study used a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design. The data were collected using a convenience sampling survey via social media. Results: A total of 270 participants (staff and students) took part in this study, including 232 (85.9%) females and 38 (14.1%) males. Moreover, a high percentage of participants (78.8%) acknowledged that family presence strongly affected the improvement of the patients condition. However, 69.3% of participants thought that involving family members during special care processes or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would be traumatizing for these individuals. Moreover, there was a significant diffidence between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and the number of years of employment (F = 3.60, p < 0.05). On the contrary, there were insignificant differences between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and their gender, nationality, age, education level, and years of work experience in Saudi Arabia (p > 0.05).

The underlying mechanisms for Long-COVID are still undefined, but a sustained inflammatory response caused by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in organ and tissue sanctuaries or resemblance with an autoimmune disease are within the most considered hypotheses. In this study, we analyzed the usefulness of several demographic, clinical, and immunological parameters as diagnostic biomarkers of Long-COVID in one cohort of Spanish individuals who presented signs and symptoms of this syndrome after 49 weeks post-infection, in comparison with individuals who recovered completely in the first 12 weeks after the infection. We determined that individuals with Long-COVID showed significantly increased levels of functional memory cells with high antiviral cytotoxic activity such as CD8(+) TEMRA cells, CD8()TCRæ(+) cells, and NK cells with CD56(+)CD57(+)NKG2C(+) phenotype. The persistence of these long-lasting cytotoxic populations was supported by enhanced levels of CD4(+) Tregs and the expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1 on the surface of CD3(+) T lymphocytes. With the use of these immune parameters and significant clinical features such as lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and dermatological injuries, as well as demographic factors such as female gender and O(+) blood type, a Random Forest algorithm predicted the assignment of the participants in the Long-COVID group with 100% accuracy.

METHODS Care providers from neonatal intensive care units on six continents exchanged and compared protocols on the management of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. Data collection was between March 14 and 21, 2020. We focused on central protocol components, including triaging, hygiene precautions, management at delivery, feeding protocols, and visiting policies. RESULTS Data from 20 countries were available. Disease burden varied between countries at the time of analysis. In most countries, asymptomatic infants were allowed to stay with the mother and breastfeed with hygiene precautions. We detected discrepancies between national guidance in particular regarding triaging, use of personal protection equipment, viral testing, and visitor policies. Local protocols deviated from national guidance. CONCLUSIONS At the start of the pandemic, lack of evidence-based guidance on the management of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers has led to ad hoc creation of national and local guidance. Compliance between collaborators to share and discuss protocols was excellent and may lead to more consensus on management, but future guidance should be built on high-level evidence, rather than expert consensus.

Initially, the COVID-19 patient associated coagulation disorders show an elevated level of the D-dimer, fibrinogen, and less lymphocyte count such as lymphopenia. COVID-19 associated with the Kawasaki disease has acute vasculitis in childhood which further affects the vessels found all over the body. COVID-19 linked with the thrombotic microangiopathy triggers the multiple vasculitis along with the arterioles thrombosis, medium, large venous and arterial vessels mediates the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). SARS-Co-V-2 patients have reduced primary platelet production, increased destruction of the platelet, decreased circulating platelet leads to the condition of increased thrombocytopenia which contributes to the coagulation disorder. Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the coagulation disorders via increased generation of the thrombin and stops fibrinolysis further leads to hypercoagulopathy. Along with that endothelial dysfunction activates the complement system pathways and contributes to the acute and chronic inflammation via cytokine storm with the production of the cytokines and chemokines, coagulation in different organs such as lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney and further leads to multi-organ failure.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation disorders in different organs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biobanking as a quickly growing branch of personalised medicine has undergone enormous progress during last two decades. Nowadays it is a well developed and structured multidisciplinary field that reflects developments and advances of biomedical research based on principles of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM). All these trends in PPPM progress have to be translated into practice and education of new generation of scientists and healthcare givers. The importance of biobanks for multitasking research, personalised treatment, and health care systems was emphasised by many scientists and health care experts. As biobanking carries multidisciplinary character currently including more professionals than tentwenty years ago, new generation of professional biobankers is urgently needed. To create new generation of biobankers who are fully competent to answer more and more scientific and practical questions, new study programmes, novel university curricula, and topic-dedicated courses are essential. The aim of the review is to present basic forms, trends of biobanking education offered by various biobanking related bodies and to highlight future needs. The first step is to cover all activities and duties of biobanks: acquiring, collecting, storageing and sharing biological samples and associated data, using adequate assessment for both - materials and data, taking into consideration ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI), responding to all stakeholder needs including pharmaceutical and other related industries, patient organisations and many other interested groups, emerging technologies and innovations as well as current and future requirements of health care systems. To compile educational programmes is a comprehensive task for all actors involved in the field of biobanking who contribute to the harmonised process of creating high educational level for future generation of biobankers.

The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide. The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate. As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline. Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill.

This thesis aims to analyze the reactor temperature that yields a higher RON (octane measurement) value in isomerate product using all available information in the isomerate production network. The main explanatory variables that can affect the RON value can be divided into three categories: feed impurities, isomerization reactor operations, deizohexanizer column operations. Isomerate feed network is quite complex and fed by different crude distillation units and cracker units. Various reactions occur in the isomerization reactors, and depending on the feed content, the reaction mechanism changes. This thesis applies machine learning algorithms to build a model that can capture the relationship between RON and reactor temperature with the other explanatory variables. We implemented a number of machine learning algorithms to assess their performance on the problem, specifically Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression, and KNN. Comparing with the linear regression, we achieved 0.82 decreases in the mean absolute error. The mean absolute error of the XGBoost model is 0.08 RON. We find a temperature value with the selected model that yields a higher RON number by trying different temperature values while keeping the same values for the other variables. If we used the suggested temperature by our model, we predict that we could obtain a 0.2 RON increase in the validation zone resulting in an annual profit increase of 528 000 USD Dollar. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.","output":"Octane Optimization with a Combined Machine Learning and Optimization Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases are a major threat to humanity, and it is imperative that we develop imaging tools that aid in their study, facilitate diagnosis, and guide treatment.

Early diagnosis and rapid monitoring are essential for appropriate management and control of infections. Tomographic molecular imaging enables rapid, noninvasive visualization, localization, and monitoring of molecular processes deep within the body and offers several advantages over traditional tools used for the study of infectious diseases. Noninvasive, longitudinal assessments could streamline animal studies, allow unique insights into disease pathogenesis, and expedite clinical translation of new therapeutics.

In particular, male-specific out-migration has been a sustained tradition from the hill districts of Uttarakhand. The people have been migrating not just for seeking diverse avenues of employment, but also for accessing better educational and health opportunities. As per 2011 Census, the overall population growth rate in the state was 1.7% with huge differentials in the hill and plain districts. Hill districts witnessed one-fourth growth (0.7%) of the population compared to that of plain districts (2.8%) suggestive of huge out-migration from these (hill) districts of the state. The important thing to note is that the nature and patterns of out-migration have now paved the way from long-term to permanent out-migration. Also, the lack of employment opportunities is creating distress out-migration to destinations within or outside the state, which has become a major cause of concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the most short-term migrants who returned to their villages in desperation resulting in despondency and distress. In this context, the paper explores the factors of distress migration by analysing the data from a quick survey of 323 return migrants carried out in June 2020 to understand their employment and livelihood profile, reasons for their return to native places, coping mechanism and future plans. The findings reveal that due to lack of livelihood opportunities in their place of origin, most of them would eventually like to return to their destination places in the future to eke out their living. From a policy point of view, enhancing the economic base and livelihood opportunities by focusing on niche activities with improved provisioning of educational and health infrastructure and services can eventually help restrict out-migration from Uttarakhand.","output":"Forced Out-Migration from Hill Regions and Return Migration During the Pandemic: Evidence from Uttarakhand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As suggested by many guidelines, a high ventilation rate is required to dilute the indoor virus particles and reduce the airborne transmission risk, i.e., dilution ventilation (DV).

By combining DV and VC, this paper investigated the operation of the mechanical ventilation system in high-rise buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to minimizing the cooling related energy consumption and reducing COVID-19 transmission. First, a modified Wells-Riley model was proposed to calculate DV rates. The ventilation rate required to achieve VC was also introduced. Then, a new ventilation control strategy was proposed for achieving DV and VC. Finally, a case study was conducted on a real high-rise building, where the required DV rate and the impact of the settings of the mechanical ventilation on the energy savings were evaluated. The results indicate that the required ventilation rates vary from 36 m(3)/s to 3306 m(3)/s depending on the protective measures.

The pandemic has led to calls for widespread vitamin D supplementation in public. However, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19 pandemic remains controversial. METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to analyze the causal effect of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits by using summary-level GWAS data. The causal associations were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW) with fixed effects (IVW-fixed) and random effects (IVW-random), MR-Egger, weighted edian and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR.RAPS) methods. We further applied the MR Steiger filtering method, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test and PhenoScanner tool to check and remove single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were horizontally pleiotropic. RESULTS: We found no evidence to support the causal associations between the serum 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility [IVW-fixed: odds ratio (OR) = 0.9049, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8197C0.9988, p = 0.0473], severity (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0298, 95% CI 0.7699C1.3775, p = 0.8432) and hospitalized traits (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0713, 95% CI 0.8819C1.3013, p = 0.4878) using outlier removed sets at a Bonferroni-corrected p threshold of 0.0167. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of horizontal pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analysis provided precise evidence that genetically lowered serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or hospitalized traits. Our study did not provide evidence assessing the role of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore and define the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS: After analyzing the pandemic strategies of the major organizations and countries and with a literature review conducted by a core panel, a modified Delphi survey was administered to 13 experts in the fields of vaccination, infectious disease, and public health in the Republic of Korea. The following topics were discussed: 1) identifying the objectives of the vaccination strategy, 2) identifying allocation criteria, and 3) establishing a step-by-step vaccination framework and prioritization strategy based on the allocation criteria. Two rounds of surveys were conducted for each topic, with a structured questionnaire provided via e-mail in the first round. After analyzing the responses, a meeting with the experts was held to obtain consensus on how to prioritize the population groups. RESULTS: The first objective of the vaccination strategy was maintenance of the integrity of the healthcare system and critical infrastructure, followed by reduction of morbidity and mortality and reduction of community transmission. In the initial phase, older adult residents in care homes, high-risk health and social care workers, and personal support workers who work in direct contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients would be prioritized. Expansion of vaccine supply would allow immunization of older adults not included in phase 1, followed by healthcare workers not previously included and individuals with comorbidities. Further widespread vaccine supply would ensure availability to the extended adult age groups (50C64 years old), critical workers outside the health sector, residents who cannot socially distance, and, eventually, the remaining populations.

Alongside tie-stall and cubicle housing systems, alternative free-walk systems (compost-bedded pack and artificial floor systems) are available today. This study aimed to determine and compare the acceptance of (alternative) housing systems and attitudes to certain aspects of housing systems for dairy cattle among Slovenian consumers, farmers, and stakeholders. They were asked online about their views on the most important aspects (animals, farmers, products, environment) of housing systems as well as the acceptance of four housing systems and related issues. The results reveal differences in attitude and acceptance among the main groups of respondents. Consumers, stakeholders, and conventional farmers preferred the artificial floor system, while organic farmers preferred the compost-bedded pack housing system. Consumers and organic farmers showed below-average scores for all aspects analyzed concerning animals, products, and the environment, whereas conventional farmers and stakeholders had shown above-average scores for aspects related to animals and the environment and negative attitudes to products. The findings suggest the need to tailor information about different housing systems to specific groups. ABSTRACT: Alternative housing systems for dairy cattle have recently emerged, such as compost-bedded packs and artificial floor ones. To determine their acceptability among categories of people with a connection to animal husbandry, this study aimed to identify and compare the acceptability of (alternative) housing systems and attitudes to aspects of housing systems for dairy cattle among Slovenian consumers, farmers, and stakeholders. Farmers (N = 306), consumers (N = 508), and stakeholders (N = 40) were interviewed about their views on the main aspects (animals, farmers, products, environment) of housing systems for dairy cattle, the acceptance of four housing systems, and important housing features. The results show that consumers, stakeholders, and conventional farmers preferred housing systems with an artificial floor, while organic farmers preferred a housing system with a compost-bedded pack. Consumers and organic farmers expressed the greatest acceptance of almost every aspect of the housing system, except for a sufficient income for farmers and a low workload. Conventional farmers and stakeholders hold similar views, except for the expectation that the animals have enough space to move around, the image of the landscape, and the animals health and wellbeing, where stakeholders showed more acceptance than conventional farmers. The results imply that systematically planned information aimed at different target categories is needed to increase the acceptance of (alternative) housing systems for cattle.","output":"Views of Consumers, Farmers and Stakeholders on Alternative Dairy Cattle Housing Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colonization of the gut by microbes depends on a number of factors including age, diet, genetic makeup, gender, geographic location, and health status of an individual.

Using masks, soap-based hand washing, and maintaining social distancing are some of the common methods to prevent the spread of the virus. In the absence of any preventive medications, from the outset of pandemic, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have been one of the first-line measures to control transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this narrative review is to evaluate the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 towards ABHS and understand their potential adverse effects on humans. Ethanol and isopropanol have been the most commonly used alcohols in ABHS (e.g., gel, solution, spray, wipes, or foam) with alcohol in the range of 70C85% v/v in World Health Organization or Food and Drug Administration-approved ABHS. The denaturation of proteins around the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 positive sense single-stranded RNA virus is the major mechanism of action of ABHS. Due to frequent use of high-percentage alcohol-containing ABHS over an extended period of time, the oral, dermal, or pulmonary absorption is a possibility. In addition to the systemic toxicity, topical adverse effects such as contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis are plausible and have been reported during COVID-19. ABHS appear to be effective in controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with the concern of oral, dermal, or pulmonary absorption.","output":"Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 towards Alcohols: Potential for Alcohol-Related Toxicity in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created a complex psychological environment for persons in America A total of 450 USA MTurk workers completed measures of: (a) basic demographic characteristics;(b) health risk factors for COVID-19;(c) perceived susceptibility variables related to COVID-19;(d) COVID-19 preventive health behaviors;and (e) distress, physical symptoms, and quality of life measures The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 This recruitment period corresponded to the first 2C3 weeks of lockdown in most of the USA Follow-up surveys were completed by 151 of the USA participants between June 19, 2020 and July 11, 2020 (approximately 2 months after the first measurement) These data permit evaluation of relationships among demographic variables, COVID-19 stress and coping, COVID-19 preventive health behavior, and the role of mindfulness as a possible moderator of distress as well as a predictor of preventive health behavior The availability of follow-up data permit longitudinal analyses that provide a stronger basis for causal inference","output":"Psychological reactions to COVID-19: Survey data assessing perceived susceptibility, distress, mindfulness, and preventive health behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the RT-PCR with primers that anneal to the 5' and the 3' extremities of the genome segments of bunyaviruses and internal primers that anneal to the S segment of Simbu serogroup viruses in a nested PCR it was possible to amplify the Oropouche virus (ORO) genome from the sera of three patients.

Therefore, the strong capability of learning and generalizing from limited supervision, including a limited amount of annotations, sparse annotations, and inaccurate annotations, is crucial for the successful application of deep learning models in medical image segmentation.

Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify at home deterioration in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or SpO2). A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in VA/Q. A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to examine the effect of reduction of VA/Q or increase in shunt on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersects the line representing ambient PIO2. Reduced VA/Q predicted SpO2 instability breathing air, e.g. a {+/-}1 kPa change in PIO2 gave an 8% change in SpO2 at a VA/Q of 0.4 but a 1.5% change in SpO2 with a 15% shunt. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2.

However, information about the long-term complications affecting this population is lacking. AIMS: Investigation of long-term impact of COVID-19 in HCW. METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3-4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that about a third of HCW who responded to the survey were still struggling to cope with the symptoms of what is now known as long covid several months after the acute COVID-19 infections.
