METHODS: The percentages of the cytological sample types processed at the University of Naples Federico II, during the first 3 weeks of Italian national lockdown were compared with those of the same period in 2019. RESULTS: During the emergency, the percentage of cytology samples reported as malignant increased (p<0.001), reflecting higher percentages of breast (p=0.002) and lymph nodes FNAs (p=0.008), effusions (p<0.001) and urine (p=0.005). Conversely, thyroid FNAs (p<0.001) and Pap smears (p=0.003) were reduced.

Transdiagnostic mechanisms, including trauma, personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation are considered relevant to the development and maintenance of mental health problems and therefore may play a role in individuals reactions to the pandemic. Aim: To identify moderating and mediating factors associated with pandemic-related distress and mental health problems in adults and families, we aim to investigate the interactions of interpersonal trauma (childhood trauma and domestic violence), psychological capacities (personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation) and pandemic-related adversity on psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to investigate behavioral and cognitive consequences of the pandemic (e.g., media consumption, vaccination status, conspiracy beliefs). Methods: Using an online-based cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will investigate a sample of adult participants recruited via online platforms in German-speaking countries over the course of 1 year with four measurements points via self-report instruments (personality functioning: PID5BF +; mentalizing: MentS, PRFQ; emotion regulation: DERS-SF; mental health problems: PHQ-9, GAD-7; a composite pandemic-related stress score). Structural equation and multi-level modeling will be performed for data analyses. Implications: This study will provide data on the moderating and mediating effects of trauma, personality functioning and mentalizing during the pandemic in a large community sample, particularly on vulnerable groups like families. Identifying transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology in the course of a pandemic crisis may provide valuable insight for the development of pre- and intervention measures for potential psychological distress during and post the pandemic.","output":"Transdiagnostic Mechanisms of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adults and Families in Germany: Study Protocol of a Cross-Sectional and 1-Year Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of telemedicine has grown immensely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities.

Study designMultiple bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, clinical trial registries and further information sources were systematically searched for literature (last bibliographic search: May 7, 2021). Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies that included pediatric study participants and evaluated rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections against RT-PCR as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. ResultsWe included 17 studies with a total of 6355 pediatric study participants. All included studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in pediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI: 57.4%-70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.5%), respectively. In symptomatic children, the pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 71.8% (95% CI: 63.6%-78.8%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.7% (95% CI: 96.6%-99.5%). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in asymptomatic children was 56.2% (95% CI: 47.6%-64.4%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.6% (95% CI: 97.3%-99.3%).

Recent COVID-19-specific enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) recommendations provide a cogent framework for managing patient care pathways and reducing health care worker (HCW) and patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. eTCB has been applied broadly and has proven to be effective in limiting fomite and droplet transmissions in hospitals and between hospitals and the surrounding community. At the same time, resource constrained conditions involving limited personal protective equipment (PPE), low testing availability, and variability in physical space can require modifications in the way hospitals implement eTCB. While eTCB has come to be viewed as the standard practice, COVID-19 related resource constraints often require hospital implementation teams to customize eTCB solutions. We provide and describe a cross-functional, collaborative on-the-ground adaptive application of eTCB initially piloted at two hospitals and subsequently reproduced at 16 additional hospitals and health systems in the US to date. By effectively facilitating eTCB deployment, hospital leaders and practitioners can establish clearer zones of risk and related protective practices that prevent transmission to HCWs and patients. We outline key insights and recommendations gained from recent implementation under the aforementioned constraints and a cross-functional team process that can be utilized by hospitals to most effectively adapt eTCB under resource constraints.","output":"Containing SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals facing finite PPE, limited testing, and physical space variability: Navigating resource constrained enhanced traffic control bundling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread reductions in mobility and induced observable changes in atmospheric emissions.

We also show how pandemics repurpose justifications for traditional crimes and offer an opportunity for narrative repositioning of criminals.

Here, we show that methylene blue concentration-dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the original strain as well as for those of variants of concerns such as the D614G mutant and delta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 M). Methylene blue also showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viral proteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63 - ACE2, hepatitis C virus E - CD81) as well as others (e.g., IL-2 - IL-2R) with similar potency. This non-specificity notwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells both for the original strain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virus replication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 M) when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA.

Liver decellularisation was carried out by portal vein perfusion using a detergent-based solution. Decellularised scaffolds were placed in a sterile perfusion apparatus consisting of a sealed organ chamber, functioning at 37C in normal atmospheric conditions.

The Grade 9 Career Guidance Project, originally developed as a group-based career development intervention, required radical adaptation into a self-directed, manualized format to offer career guidance to Grade 9 learners from low-income communities amid a global pandemic. The adaptation and continuation of the project was deemed essential as secondary school learners in low-income communities have limited career guidance support. Furthermore, a close collaboration with the teachers at eight resource-constrained South African secondary schools was vital for successful implementation. To assess the success of the adaptation to a self-directed format, a mixed-methods design was employed, and Life Orientation teachers evaluative feedback was solicited (n = 11). Favorable quantitative results were obtained;majority of teachers agreed that learners enjoyed the booklet (manualized format) and that it was deemed an adequate substitute to the previous contact-based format of the Career Guidance Project. This was also confirmed by the qualitative findings revealing teachers satisfaction with the booklets content, specifically that the booklet is complementary to the Life Orientation curriculum. Qualitative findings identified specific contextual barriers that contributed to some learners struggling to use the booklet optimally. The results suggest that it is feasible and acceptable to implement a self-directed career guidance intervention among secondary school learners amid a global pandemic. Teachers recommended ways to integrate the booklet, resources, and contact sessions as a preferred way forward.

Resilience capacity has been explored in school nutrition setting but a Resiliency Capacity Model addressing school meal provision is lacking. Qualitative exploration of a Resilience Capacity Model to assess the resilience capacity of school meal programs. Assisted by PRISMA, a systematic evaluation of peer-reviewed full-text articles published between 2005-2020 was performed. Qualitative and quantitative studies explored the effect of school meal programs or in-school interventions on child food security that accounts for resilience capacity of school meal programs. Thematic analysis was used to identify factors associated with strategies for building resilience capacity. Of 406 articles identified via online search, 32 full-text articles met inclusion criteria. Based on the systematic review and thematic analysis, it was found that strategies to build resilience include food availability, food accessibility, food quality, education, training, parent/teacher support, and administrative response. The Resilience Capacity Model to assess resilience capacity of school meal programs fits well in the context of school nutrition. This model can be used to assess whether the strategies adopted during unprecedented circumstances lead to a resilience or a vulnerability pathway. The findings of the systematic review of literature support that Resilience Capacity Model that accounts for identified factors can be used to assess the resilience capacity of school meal programs.

However, keyworkers' roles in addressing first episode psychosis patients' physical health are under researched. This study addresses this knowledge gap by evaluating a keyworker-mediated intervention promoting physical health among first episode psychosis patients. METHODS The study was informed by the Medical Research Council's Framework for Complex Interventions to Improve Health. First episode psychosis participants were recruited from three Irish mental health services. The intervention was evaluated in terms of its feasibility/acceptability. RESULTS Feasibility outcomes were mixed (recruitment rate = 24/68 [35.3%]; retention rate = 18/24 [75%]). The baseline sample was predominantly male (M:F ratio = 13:6; Med age = 25 y; IQR = 23-42 y). Common health issues among participants included overweightness/obesity (n = 11) and substance use (smoking/alcohol consumption [n = 19]). Participants' initial health priorities included exercising more (n = 10), improving diet (n = 6), weight loss (n = 7) and using various health/healthcare services. The intervention's acceptability was evidenced by the appreciation participants had for physical health keyworkers' support, as well as the healthy lifestyle, which the intervention promoted. Acceptability was somewhat compromised by a low-recruitment rate, variable linkages between keyworkers and general practitioners (GPs) and COVID-19 restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Physical health-oriented keyworker interventions for first episode psychosis patients show promise and further evaluation of such initiatives is warranted.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 had become a pandemic; since then, several elective clinical and surgical activities have been postponed to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. This has influenced the diagnosis and management of many diseases, including melanoma. The aim of our literature review was to evaluate whether the management of melanoma has been changed by the outbreak of COVID-19, and if so, what the consequences of these changes are. The main topics in this literature review are the screening of suspicious lesions, diagnosis of primary melanoma, and the management of early-stage and advanced melanomas in the COVID-19 era. We also reported the experience of our dermatological clinic in Turin, one of the most affected areas in Italy. ABSTRACT: Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the modus operandi of all fields of medicine, significantly impacting patients with oncological diseases and multiple comorbidities. Thus, in recent months, the establishment of melanoma management during the emergency has become a major area of interest. In addition to original articles, case reports and specific guidelines for the period have been developed. Purpose: This article aims to evaluate whether melanoma management has been changed by the outbreak of COVID-19, and if so, what the consequences are. We summarized the main issues concerning the screening of suspicious lesions, the diagnosis of primary melanoma, and the management of early-stage and advanced melanomas during the pandemic. Additionally, we report on the experience of our dermatological clinic in northern Italy. Methods: We performed a literature review evaluating articles on melanomas and COVID-19 published in the last two years on PubMed, as well as considering publications by major healthcare organizations. Concerning oncological practice in our center, we collected data on surgical and therapeutic procedures in patients with a melanoma performed during the first months of the pandemic. Conclusions: During the emergency period, the evaluation of suspicious skin lesions was ensured as much as possible. However, the reduced level of access to medical care led to a documented delay in the diagnosis of new melanomas. When detected, the management of early-stage and advanced melanomas was fully guaranteed, whereas the follow-up visits of disease-free patients have been postponed or replaced with a teleconsultation when possible.","output":"Melanoma Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency: A Literature Review and Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in preventing death from the severe respiratory illness associated with COVID-19. However, the availability of ICU beds is highly variable across the US, and health care resources are generally more plentiful in wealthier communities. We examined disparities in community ICU beds by US communities' median household income. We found a large gap in access by income: 49 percent of the lowest-income communities had no ICU beds in their communities, whereas only 3 percent of the highest-income communities had no ICU beds. Income disparities in the availability of community ICU beds were more acute in rural areas than in urban areas. Policies that facilitate hospital coordination are urgently needed to address shortages in ICU hospital bed supply to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality rates in low-income communities.","output":"Income Disparities In Access To Critical Care Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the volume of research and discussion on the health, medical, economic, financial, political, and travel advisory aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, it is essential to enquire if an outbreak of the epidemic might have been anticipated, given the well-documented history of SARS and MERS, among other infectious diseases. If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244C0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186C0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects. The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used.","output":"Alternative Global Health Security Indexes for Risk Analysis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Would compulsory treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 be justified?

Participants report biopsychosocial benefits, however, research on impact is limited. The 'SLH: Improving Experiences of Lung Disease trial', a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=120) was setup to help to address this. The first group (n=18, nine singing and nine controls) started face-to-face (five sessions) before changing to online delivery (seven sessions) due to COVID-19-related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations for transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, premeasures and postmeasures of quality of life and disease impact (Short Form 36 Health Survey, COPD Assessment Test score), breathlessness (Medical Research Council breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), balance confidence (Activity specific Balance Confidence, ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy). RESULTS: Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semistructured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face to face and online, these where (1) perceived benefits; (2) digital barriers (online) and (3) digital facilitators (online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing groups from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative data suggested possible improvements in depression (treatment effect -4.78 PHQ-9 points, p<0.05, MCID 5) and balance confidence (treatment effect +17.21 ABC scale points, p=0.04, MCID 14.2). DISCUSSION: This study identifies key considerations regarding the adaptation of SLH from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot data suggest online group singing for people with COPD may deliver benefits related to reducing depression and improved balance confidence.","output":"Moving singing for lung health online in response to COVID-19: experience from a randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides an overview of the classification, description, hosts, key developments, diagnostic techniques, and diagnostic reagents for the transmissible turkey enteritis virus.

Four COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna, University of Oxford/ Astra Zeneca (also Oxford/ Serum Institute of India) and ICMR/ Bharat Biotech have been granted emergency use authorization in the democratic world following established clinical trial procedures in their respective countries. Vaccination of the general public is expected to begin in several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately cleared to return to normal activities, including hassle-free travel. Methods. We use a delay differential equation model developed previously by our group to calculate the effects of vaccinee \`\`immunity passports'' on the spreading trajectories of the disease. We consider default virus strains as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 in our analysis. Results. We find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, vaccinees may be immediately cleared for normal life with no significant increase in case counts. Free travel of such vaccinees between two regions should not jeopardize the infection control performance of either. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be eight months or more before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or eliminated. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent however, social as well as travel restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until transmission of the disease is eliminated. Conclusions. Designing high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drive with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants if any of efficacy, and optimizing distribution accordingly.

Many MSME Actors can not survive or in other words roll out. Various ways are done by MSMEs to stay afloat. One of them is by reducing the workforce and innovating and creativity following the developing conditions. However, there are many obstacles faced by MSMEs in the post-Covid 19 pandemic or the new normal. This is due to significant changes in government regulations and consumer behavior. So that it has an impact on the business run by MSMEs.

Although extensive studies have been reported on the biology and pathogenesis of PDCoV, the mechanisms by which PDCoV enters cells are not well characterized. In this study, we investigated how PDCoV enters IPI-2I cells, a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells derived from pig ileum. Immunofluorescence assays, siRNA interference, specific pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative mutation results revealed that PDCoV entry into IPI-2I cells depended on clathrin, dynamin and a low-pH environment, but was independent of caveolae. Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) revealed that PDCoV entry involves macropinocytosis and depends on NHE rather than on PI3K. Additionally, Rab5 and Rab7, but not Rab11, regulated PDCoV endocytosis. This is the first study to demonstrate that PDCoV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis as alternative endocytic pathways to enter porcine intestinal epithelial cells. We also discussed the entry pathways of PDCoV into other porcine cell lines. Our findings reveal the entry mechanisms of PDCoV and provide new insight into the PDCoV life cycle. IMPORTANCE An emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, PDCoV has the potential for cross-species transmission, attracting extensive attenuation. Characterizing the detailed process of PDCoV entry into cells will deepen our understanding of the viral infection and pathogenesis, and provide the clues for therapeutic intervention against PDCoV. With the objective, we used complementary approaches to dissect the process in PDCoV-infected IPI-2I cells, a line of more physiologically relevant intestinal epithelial cells to PDCoV infection in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that PDCoV enters IPI-2I cells via macropinocytosis that does not require a specific receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis that requires a low-pH environment and dynamin, while a caveola-mediated endocytic pathway is used by PDCoV to enter swine testicular (ST) cells and porcine kidney (LLC-PK1) cells. These findings provide a molecular detail of the cellular entry pathways of PDCoV and may direct us toward novel antiviral drug development.","output":"Porcine deltacoronavirus enters porcine IPI-2I intestinal epithelial cells via macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis dependent on pH and dynamin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is presenting serious challenges to the worlds healthcare systems. The high communicability of the COVID-19 necessitates robust medical preparedness and vigilance. OBJECTIVE: To report on the simulation-based training and test preparedness activities to prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for effective and safe handling of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Two activities were conducted: simulation-based training to all HCWs and a full-scale unannounced simulation-based disaster exercise at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC). The online module was designed to enhance the knowledge on COVID-19. This module was available to all KFMC staff. The five hands-on practical part of the course was available to frontliner HCWs. The unannounced undercover simulated patients full-scale COVID-19 simulation-based disaster exercise took place in the emergency department over 3 hours. Six scenarios were executed to test the existing plan in providing care of suspected COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 2620 HCWs took the online module, 17 courses were conducted and 337 frontliner HCWs were trained. 94% of learners were satisfied and recommended the activity to others. The overall compliance rate of the full-scale COVID-19 disaster drill with infection control guidelines was 90%.

METHODS A retrospective review of all patients (n = 165) undergoing colectomy for an adenoma unresectable at colonoscopy was performed on patients collected in a prospective database. One hundred four patients underwent laparoscopic colectomy and 61 underwent open colectomy between 1991 and 2003. Follow-up was 7 to 155 (median, 90) months. RESULTS In the laparoscopic group, 85% of the patients underwent a right colectomy and 15% underwent a left colectomy or a sigmoidectomy. Conversion to open colectomy occurred in 4.8% of the cases. Complications occurred in 14% of the patients, including 1 death. The median length of stay was 4 days. At final pathology, cancer was diagnosed in 15 patients: stage I in 8 patients, stage II in 5, and stage III in 2. In the open colectomy group, 69% of the patients underwent right colectomy. The complication rate reached 23% (P = .13), including death in 2 patients. The median length of stay was 6 days (P < .01). Cancer was diagnosed in 6 patients: stage I in 5 patients, and stage II in 1.

Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D.

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co- immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Author summary Anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies provide strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models, and correlate with protection in humans, supporting the notion that induction of strong humoral immunity is key to protection. We show induction of robust antibody and T cell responses by different Spike DNA-based vaccine regimens able to effectively mediate protection and to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model. This study provides the opportunity to compare vaccines able to induce different humoral and cellular immune responses in an effort to develop durable immunity against the SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine regimen comprising simultaneous co-immunization of DNA and Protein at the same anatomical site showed best neutralizing abilities and was more effective than DNA alone in inducing protective immune responses and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, an expansion of the DNA vaccine regimen to include co-immunization with Spike protein may be of advantage also for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Control of SARS-CoV-2 infection after Spike DNA or Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stigmatization of people with pedophilic sexual interests is a topic of growing academic and professional consideration, owing to its potential role in moderating pedophiles' emotional well-being, and motivation and engagement in child abuse prevention schemes.

Colchicine was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs (11.2% vs. 8.8%, RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.41C2.47) and drug discontinuation (5.4% vs. 3.7%, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.25C1.99). In both cases, the risk was proportional to the daily dose or duration of treatment, possibly due to early drug discontinuation or tolerance. Other CRAEs (muscle-related, liver,hematologic,cutaneous, infections) were not increased by colchicine, as long as all-cause death (2.2% vs. 1.9%, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79C1.54) or non-cardiovascular death (1.5% vs. 1%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.93C2.19). Colchicine is efficacious and safe for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs and drug discontinuation is not significant if colchicine is used at lower doses (0.5 mg daily) or for longer periods of time (> 6 months).

Ease of transmission has allowed the virus to spread worldwide with varying degrees of virulence depending upon the virus strain and host species. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics, and the year-to-year genomic changes in low and high virulence APMV-1 imply that distinct genotypes of APMV-1 are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations across the globe. This vast genomic diversity may be favoured by large variety of avian species susceptibility to APMV-1 infection, and by the availability of highly mobile wild birds. It has long been considered that waterfowls are not sensitive to APMV-1 and are unable to show any clinical signs, however, outbreaks from the 90s contradict these concepts. The APMV-1 isolates are increasingly reported from the waterfowl. Waterfowl have strong innate immune responses, which minimize the impact of virus infection, however, are unable to prevent the viral shedding. Numerous APMV-1 are carried by domestic waterfowl intermingling with terrestrial poultry. Therefore, commercial ducks and geese should be vaccinated against APMV-1 to minimize the virus shedding and for the prevention the transmission.

ABSTRACT: Numerous studies have shown that cf nDNA significantly rises in stress caused by exercise. However, during nuclear decondensation, released DNA is followed by histones. Histones are also a common disease marker. After PAD4 mediated hypercitrullination extracellular H3Cit exhibits high toxicity contributing to tissue damage which, in cases of systemic inflammation, may lead to multiorgan failure and finally to death. We tested whether circulating histones rise in response to strenuous exercise. Eleven average-trained men performed three treadmill exercise tests to exhaustion at speed corresponding to 70% VO2max separated by 72 h of resting. Blood was collected before and just after each bout of exercise and plasma proteins were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas platelet activity was estimated with Light Transmission Aggregometry. Both, circulating histones and PAD4 raised in response to exercise. Plasma citrullinated histones increased from 3.1 ng/mL to 5.96 ng/mL (p = 0.0059), from 3.65 ng/mL to 6.37 ng/mL (p = 0.02), and from 3.86 ng/mL to 4.75 ng/mL (p = 0.033) after the first, second, and third treadmill run, respectively.

METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent otoplasty using a modified anterior scoring technique combined with postauricular fixation sutures. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive patients (421 primary otoplasties) were included. Each auricle was examined before surgery, after surgery, and at a long-term follow-up visit, and the distance between the lateral helical rim and the mastoid surface was measured at 3 points. In addition, patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-two percent of 222 patients were examined at a long-term follow-up visit. Follow-up of 301 auricles was on average 6.25 years (range, 44-106 months). The mean preoperative measurements among all auricles were 23.3 mm at the uppermost point of the helix, 28.6 mm at the middle, and 25.9 mm at the lobule; these values were 14.2, 14.0, and 16.1 mm, respectively, at the end of the operation and 16.0, 17.5, and 17.4 mm, respectively, 6 years later. Long-term data revealed a median 2-mm lateralization of the auricle. The aesthetic result of otoplasty was rated as \\"very good\\" by 71.8% of patients and as \\"good\\" by 19.4% of patients; 6.9% of patients thought the result was \\"satisfactory\\" and 1.9% \\"unsatisfactory.\\" Complete recurrence of the protrusion was seen in 7 ears (2.3%) and partial recurrence within the upper third of the pinna in 26 ears (8.6%).

Interventions An 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in S?o Paulo; n = 217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in S?o Paulo; n = 215 participants in Lima). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months.

The report of the Scientific Institute of the AOK health insurance company (WldO) and surveys of the Working Group of Clinical Gastroenterologists (ALGK) and the Professional Association of Private Gastroenterologists in Germany (bng) demonstrated that the coronavirus lockdown led to a significant reduction of gastrointestinal diseases and gastroenterological services including screening colonoscopy. It is likely that the reduction of the overcapacity of the German healthcare system will also be continued by reduction of inpatient services after the corona pandemic has been overcome. It is essential to keep the medical profession attractive for young colleagues. The high rates of burnout and suicide and the difficult compatibility with the requirements of a life balance are alarm signals that have to be solved.","output":"Folgen der COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie fr die Gastroenterologie in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. The article discusses significant changes in the procedure for pharmaceutical inspection of drug manufacturers for compliance with the requirements of the rules of good manufacturing practice (GMP) of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), related to restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The article presents the main international guidelines describing the remote conduct of pharmaceutical inspections, which is the basis for further updating the relevant procedures in the law of the EAEU. An overview of the foreign practice of pharmaceutical inspection during the pandemic is given. In addition, the changes in the Russian regulatory approaches to control and supervision in the Russian legislation are presented. Conclusion. These data give an idea that, with considering the above, there is a need for further convergence of the requirements, the practice of conducting pharmaceutical inspections for compliance with the requirements of GMP Rules in order to harmonize the norms between Russian regulatory documents, the norms of the EAEU law and international standards. This requires the development of a dialogue with the participation of stakeholders. ? Meshkovskiy A. P., Beregovykh V. V., Shestakov V. N., Pyatigorskaya N. V., Aladysheva Z. I., Nikolenko N.

We review the surgical techniques, outcomes and complications arising from the various existing surgical alternatives, including cosmetic iris implants-which based on the available evidence should be considered malpractice-as well as laser iris depigmentation and cosmetic keratopigmentation. Laser iris depigmentation has been used clinically for aesthetic purposes without receiving official approval or licensing. The technique can be performed in an outpatient clinic thanks to the use of neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers, but scientific literature data about this treatment is very limited. Cosmetic iris implants are neither CE-marked nor Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, and lead to severe complications arising from their placement including uveitis, hyphema, glaucoma, cataract, corneal endothelial damage and severe vision loss. Management of complications resulting from iris implants might require several surgical procedures, and the follow-up is difficult among these poorly informed patients. Keratopigmentation is the most extensively studied technique and had long been investigated before being introduced into clinical practice: already introduced centuries ago, it was recently developed, reporting adequate levels of safety and efficacy. The medium- and long-term cosmetic outcomes of keratopigmentation and patient satisfaction have been the subject of recent reports. The available level of evidence suggests that cosmetic keratopigmentation is the best evidence-supported surgical choice for patients seeking a permanent cosmetic eye color change. Still, additional investigation is needed to optimize the outcomes, minimize postoperative complications and further develop this and other new surgical alternatives such as laser procedures.","output":"Cosmetic Change of the Apparent Color of the Eye: A Review on Surgical Alternatives, Outcomes and Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world and requires new therapies for its treatment. In this context, the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been developed to treat different types of tumors. The Annona muricata plant is known for having anticancer activity. Its main compounds present in the leaves, stems and skin, allowing for its use as reducing agents. In this manuscript, AgNPs with leaf extract (AgNPs-LE) and fruit peel extract (AgNPs-PE) of A. muricata were biosynthesized obtaining an average nanoparticle diameter sizes smaller than 50 nm, being 19.63  3.7 nm and 16.56  4.1 nm, and with a surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) at 447 and 448 nm, respectively. The lactone functional group present in the LE and PE extracts was identified by the FTIR technique. The behavior and antiproliferation activity of AgNPs-LE and AgNPs-PE were evaluated in breast, colon and melanoma cancer cell lines. Our results showed that Annona muricata fruit peel, which is a waste product, has an antitumor effect more potent than leaf extract. This difference is maintained with AgNPs where the destruction of cancer cells was, for the first time, achieved using concentrations that do not exceed 3 g/mL with a better therapeutic index in the different tumor strains. In conclusion, we present a low-cost one-step experimental setup to generate AgNPs-PE whose in-vitro biocompatibility and powerful therapeutic effect make it a very attractive tool worth exploiting.","output":"Silver Nanoparticles from Annona muricata Peel and Leaf Extracts as a Potential Potent, Biocompatible and Low Cost Antitumor Tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a sanguivorous (i.e., blood-eating) bat species distributed in the Americas from northern Mexico southwards to central Chile and Argentina.

While several studies have reported the association between frailty and COVID-19 mortality or length of hospital stay, there have been no community-based studies on the association between frailty and risk of severe infection. Considering that different definitions have been identified to assess frailty, this study aimed to compare the association between frailty and severe COVID-19 infection in UK Biobank using two frailty classifications: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. METHODS: A total of 383,845 UK Biobank participants recruited 2006C2010 in England (211,310 [55.1%] women, baseline age 37C73 years) were included. COVID-19 test data were provided by Public Health England (available up to 28 June 2020). An adapted version of the frailty phenotype derived by Fried et al. was used to define frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail, or frail). A previously validated frailty index was derived from 49 self-reported questionnaire items related to health, disease and disability, and mental wellbeing (robust, mild frailty, and moderate/severe frailty). Both classifications were derived from baseline data (2006C2010). Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to analyse the associations between both frailty classifications and severe COVID-19 infection (resulting in hospital admission or death), adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Of UK Biobank participants included, 802 were admitted to hospital with and/or died from COVID19 (323 deaths and 479 hospitalisations). After analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, a higher risk of COVID-19 was observed for pre-frail (risk ratio (RR) 1.47 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71]) and frail (RR 2.66 [95% CI 2.04; 3.47]) individuals compared to those classified as robust using the frailty phenotype. Similar results were observed when the frailty index was used (RR mildly frail 1.46 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71] and RR moderate/severe frailty 2.43 [95% CI 1.91; 3.10]). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection resulting in hospital admission or death, irrespective of how it was measured and independent of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Public health strategies need to consider the additional risk that COVID-19 poses in individuals with frailty, including which additional preventive measures might be required.","output":"Comparison of two different frailty measurements and risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19: findings from UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital El Salvador: a novel paradigm of intensive care in response to COVID-19 in central America.

Clinical triage and risk assessment have become increasingly challenging due to the shortage of medical resources and the strain on hospital infrastructure caused by the pandemic. As a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs), we now have access to a vast amount of clinical data, which allows us to develop predictive models and decision support systems to address these challenges. To date, however, there are no widely accepted benchmark ED triage prediction models based on large-scale public EHR data. An open-source benchmarking platform would streamline research workflows by eliminating cumbersome data preprocessing, and facilitate comparisons among different studies and methodologies. In this paper, based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database, we developed a publicly available benchmark suite for ED triage predictive models and created a benchmark dataset that contains over 400,000 ED visits from 2011 to 2019. We introduced three ED-based outcomes (hospitalization, critical outcomes, and 72-hour ED reattendance) and implemented a variety of popular methodologies, ranging from machine learning methods to clinical scoring systems. We evaluated and compared the performance of these methods against benchmark tasks. Our codes are open-source, allowing anyone with MIMIC-IV-ED data access to perform the same steps in data processing, benchmark model building, and experiments.

In the most severe cases this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due to respiratory failure associated with ARDS, the clinical intervention is the use of mechanical ventilation. Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of these ventilators may lead to ventilation-associated/ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Damage caused to epithelial cells within the alveoli can lead to various types of complications and increased mortality rates. A key component of the immune response is recruitment of macrophages, immune cells that differentiate into phenotypes with unique pro- and/or anti-inflammatory roles based on the surrounding environment. An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can have deleterious effects on the individuals health. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we develop a mathematical model of interactions between the immune system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage polarization. Through Latin hypercube sampling we generate a virtual cohort of patients with biologically feasible dynamics.

Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-?E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-?E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein. Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo. Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV.","output":"Identification of the Mechanisms Causing Reversion to Virulence in an Attenuated SARS-CoV for the Design of a Genetically Stable Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents selected aspects of the empirical qualitative research conducted by the authors at the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, in July and August 2020.

Full-length frataxin has a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which facilitates its translocation into mitochondria where it is processed through cleavage at G41-L42 and K80-S81 by mitochondrial processing (MPP) to release mitochondrial mature frataxin (81-210). Alternative splicing of FXN also leads to expression of N-terminally acetylated extra-mitochondrial frataxin (76-210) named isoform E because it was discovered in erythrocytes. Frataxin isoforms are undetectable in serum or plasma, and originally whole blood could not be used as a biomarker in brief therapeutic trials because it is present in erythrocytes, which have a half-life of 115-days and so frataxin levels would remain unaltered. Therefore, an assay was developed for analyzing frataxin in platelets, which have a half-life of only 10-days. However, our discovery that isoform E is only present in erythrocytes, whereas, mature frataxin is present primarily in short-lived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), granulocytes, and platelets, meant that both proteins could be quantified in whole blood samples. We now report a quantitative assay for frataxin proteoforms in whole blood from healthy controls and FRDA patients. The assay is based on stable isotope dilution coupled with immunoprecipitation (IP) and two-dimensional-nano-ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/parallel reaction monitoring/high resolution mass spectrometry (2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/HRMS).

Right ventriculoarterial coupling (RVAC) is a marker of subclinical myocardial damage. The association with mortality in COVID-19 patients has been recently investigated. Objectives: To determine if there is a difference in patients with abnormal vs normal RVAC, in clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables. Analyze if there is an association between the presence of abnormal RVAC and one-year mortality. Investigate the cutoff value of the RVAC to predict mortality. Methods.: A single-center, prospective, analytical study. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Patients who were on mechanical ventilation during the study, a history of ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded. The patients were included during the period from May to August 2020, the 1-year follow-up was carried out through the electronic medical record and telephone calls. The echocardiograms were performed with the Phillips IE-33, the strain determination was obtained with the Qlab 13.0 software. The quantitative variables were compared with the Student's T test or the U Mann-Whitney test, according to the normality of the variables;qualitative variables were contrasted with the x2 test. One-year survival was determined with the Kaplan-Meier curves, and the association with one-year mortality was investigated with Cox regression. The cut-off value for predicting mortality was determined with ROC curves. The RVAC was determined with the right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain / pulmonary systolic artery pressure ratio. Abnormal right ventriculoarterial coupling was determined with a value less than 0.8. Results: 81 patients were included, of whom 45 had an abnormal RVAC. Patients with abnormal RVAC had higher mortality and a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation;they had higher levels of biomarkers. Among the echocardiographic variables, they had lower the right ventricular fractional area change, the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, the left ventricular longitudinal strain, the left atrial reservoir strain, the right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain, the RVAC;while they also presented higher the pulmonary systolic artery pressure and the tricuspid regurgitation velocity. The one-year survival of patients with abnormal RVAC was 53% vs 91%, the association with 1-year mortality was HR: 7.0 (CI95 2.1-23;p = 0.0001). The cutoff value of the RVAC to predict mortality was <0.48 (Sensitivity 71%, Specificity 90%, AUC: 0.836;p = <0.0001). Conclusion: The patients with COVID-19 and an abnormal RVAC had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation and mortality;presented higher levels of biomarkers. Half of the patients with abnormal RVAC died, presenting an association to predict mortality. The cut-off value of <0.48 was the best associated with mortality.","output":"Right ventriculoarterial coupling as a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article provides a comprehensive overview and classification of minimally invasive surgical instruments with an accessory channel incorporating fibreoptics or another auxiliary device for various purposes. More specifically, this review was performed with the focus on the newly emerging field of optical biopsy, its objective being to discuss primarily the instruments capable of carrying out the optical biopsy and subsequent tissue resection. Instruments housing the fibreoptics for other uses, as well as instruments with an accessory channel capable of housing the fibreoptics instead of their original auxiliary device after relevant design modifications, supplement the review. The entire Espacenet and Scopus databases were searched, yielding numerous patents and articles on conceptual and existing instruments satisfying the criteria. The instruments were categorised based on the function the fibreoptics or the auxiliary device serves. On the basis of their geometrical placement with respect to the tissue resector or manipulator, the subcategories were further defined. This subdivision was used to identify the feasibility of performing the optical biopsy and the tissue resection in an accurate and successive fashion. In general, the existing concepts or instruments are regarded as limited with regard to such a functionality, either due to the placement of their accessory channel with or without the fibreoptics or due to the operational restrictions of their tissue manipulators. A novel opto-mechanical biopsy harvester, currently under development at Delft University of Technology, is suggested as a promising alternative, ensuring a fast and accurate succession of the optical and the mechanical biopsies of a flat superficial tissue.","output":"Minimally invasive surgical instruments with an accessory channel capable of integrating fibre-optic cable for optical biopsy: a review of the state of the art."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The disease from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been considered as an international concern and a pandemic starting from the declaration of the World Health Organization (WHO) as an outbreak disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the prevention of knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the residents of Ethiopia. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author's network with popular social media such as Facebook, Telegram, and email. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit participants. In doing so, we collected the responses of 341 participants successfully from April 15 to 22, 2020. The collected data were analyzed by STATA version 14 software and descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the knowledge and practices of the community towards the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The majority of respondents 80.5% were male. About 91.2% of the participants heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, out of 341 participants 90.0%, 93.8% of them knew that the COVID-19 pandemic was prevented by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing, respectively. This shows that the prevention knowledge of the participants towards the COVID-19 by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing was high. However, out of 341 participants only 61%,84% of them practiced social distance and frequent handwashing toward COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the participants knew the ways to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), but there was a great problem of changing this prevention knowledge to practices. This shows that there is an action gap between having prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 and implementing it into practices to tackle the spread of the COVID-19 among communities. Therefore, the concerned body should be focused on providing awareness and education for the community regarding the implementation of prevention knowledge to practices.","output":"The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention among residents of Ethiopia.

We hypothesized that lung and cardiac ultrasound examinations, serially and simultaneously performed, could monitor disease severity in COVID-related ARDS. METHODS: We enrolled 47 consecutive patients with COVID-related ARDS (1st March-31st May 2020). Lung and cardiac ultrasounds were performed on admission, at discharged and when clinically needed. RESULTS: Most patients were mechanically ventilated (75%) and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was needed in ten patients (21.2%). The in-ICU mortality rate was 27%%. On admission, not survivors showed a higher LUS score (p = 0.006) and a higher incidence of consolidations (p = 0.003), lower values of LVEF (p = 0.027) and a higher RV/LV ratio (0.008). At discharge, a significant reduction in the incidence of subpleural consolidations (p < 0.001) and, thus, in LUS score (p < 0.001) and an increase in patter A findings (p < 0.001) together with reduced systolic pulmonary arterial pressures were detectable. In not survivors at final examination, an increased in LUS score (p < 0.001), and in RV/LV ratio (p < 0.001) associated with a reduction in TAPSE (p = 0.013) were observed. A significant correlation was observed between LUS and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (p = 0.04). LUS and RV/LV resulted independent predictors of in-ICU death.

We measured HLA-A*02 and HLA-B*07 expression in 3 longitudinal samples from 41 participants using a 33-marker CyTOF panel designed to identify major immune cell types. 3/123 samples (2.4%) showed HLA allele expression that did not match their longitudinal pairs. Furthermore, these same three samples cytometric signature did not match qPCR HLA class I allele data, suggesting that they were accurately identified as mismatches. We conclude that this technique is useful for detecting sample labeling errors in cytometric analyses of longitudinal data.

However, in a pandemic like COVID-19, it is essential that drug formulations are readily available, affordable and convenient to administer to every patient around the globe. In this study, we have developed a Self-injectable extended release subcutaneous injection of Remdesivir (SelfExRem) for the treatment of COVID-19. As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23-30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer. The time required for injection was evaluated both manually and by using an autoinjector. In vitro release of all the batches were carried out in 1% v/v tween 80 in phosphate buffer saline.

Thereby, RNA secondary structures that require base-pairing between the position 1 of a codon with the position 1 of an opposing codon (here named RNA secondary structure class c(1)) are under-represented. We conclude that this bias may result from the co-evolution of codon sequence and mRNA secondary structure, suggesting that RNA secondary structures are generally important in protein-coding regions of mRNAs.

Methods This was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical, laboratory and treatment patterns of consecutive patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay and death. Findings A total of 2080 patients were included in the study. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Amongst the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5-11) days.

Grading scales are available to aid the assessment of curative risk for microsurgery and radiosurgery. No grading system has been developed to assess the curative risk of endovascular surgery. OBJECTIVE To report our retrospective application of the AVM embocure score to patients treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 39 patients with CAVM treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 with the primary aim of achieving a curative embolization. After reviewing all the different variables associated with the conventional Onyx embolization technique for CAVMs, we identified the following as the most relevant characteristics influencing the chances for complete angiographic embolization and complication risk: the number of arterial pedicles and draining veins, size of AVM nidus, and vascular eloquence. We sought to develop a scoring system to assess the complication risk for a curative embolization of CAVM with liquid embolic Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). We developed the AVM embocure score (AVMES). This scoring system ranges from 3 to 10 and is the arithmetic sum of the number of arterial pedicles feeding the AVM (3, 4-6, >6), the number of draining veins (3, 4-6, >6), the size of the AVM nidus in centimeters (3, 4-6, >6), and the vascular eloquence (0-1). We applied AVMES to the same cohort of patients and validated the predictability of complete angiographic embolization and expected clinical risk of complication. RESULTS In lesions with an AVMES of 3 (n=8), there was a 100% rate of complete AVM obliteration and 0% rate of major complications. In AVMES 4 (n=12) lesions, there was 75% complete obliteration rate, with 8% major morbidity. In AVMES 5 (n=9) lesions, there was 78% complete obliteration and 11% major morbidity. In AVMES >5 (n=10) there was 20% complete obliteration and 30% major morbidity. Receiver-operator curve analysis showed that this scoring system was robust in its discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8356 for complete obliteration without complication, AUC=0.8240 for complete obliteration regardless of the presence of major morbidity, and AUC=0.7529 for major morbidity.

The etiological agent is a neurotropic virus, genus Lyssavirus, transmitted mainly through the saliva of infected animals. For equines, the bite of hematophagous bats is the main source of infection. Piau is an important state for equestrian sports and the increase in the number of horses with neurological clinical signs without diagnosis has increased in recent years. In this context, the aim of this study is to report to the scientific community a confirmed case of equine rabies in the Santa Luz county, Southernmost state of Piau, Brazil. Case: A 3-year-old female non-defined breed horse, was admitted to the Hospital Veterinrio da Universidade Federal do Piau (UFPI/CPCE). The equine had difficulty walking 2 days ago, in the panoramic inspection was restless and disoriented in the paddock. Rectal temperature of 38.2C, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 40 mpm, congested mucosa and dyspnea were verified. With the progression of the neurological signals, it positioned itself in a lateral decubitus with pedaling movements, hyperesthesia, dysphagia and paralysis of the hindlimbs. The clinical suspicion was rabies and the Agncia de Defesa Agropecuria do Piau (ADAPI) was communicated to euthanize the animal and collect samples for diagnosis in accordance with official standards of the Ministrio da Agricultura, Pecuria e Abastecimento (MAPA). At necropsy, there was slight brain hyperemia, with no other significant organ changes.

Many studies have tried to use data from the onset of symptoms of infector-infectee pairs to estimate the infectiousness profile of SARS-CoV-2. However, both statistical and epidemiological biases in the data could lead to an underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation steps were still minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile is wider than previously thought. For example, our estimate for the proportion of transmissions occurring 14 days or more after infection is an order of magnitude higher - namely 19% (95% CI 10%-25%). The inferred generation interval distribution is sensitive to the definition of the period of unmitigated transmission, but estimates that rely on later periods are less reliable due to intervention effects. Nonetheless, the results are robust to other factors such as the model, the assumed growth rate and possible bias of the dataset. Knowing the unmitigated infectiousness profile of infected individuals affects estimates of the effectiveness of self-isolation and quarantine of contacts. The framework presented here can help design better quarantine policies in early stages of future epidemics using data from the initial stages of transmission.","output":"The unmitigated profile of COVID-19 infectiousness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging research has examined the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in numerous settings, but a critical gap in knowledge is an understanding of the rate of infection among first responders We conducted a prospective serial serologic survey by recruiting public first responders from Cleveland area emergency medical services agencies and fire departments Volunteers submitted a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and serum samples to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 on two visits scheduled approximately 3 weeks apart 296 respondents completed a first visit and 260 completed the second While 71% of respondents reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only 5 4% (95% CI 3 1-8 6) had positive serologic testing No subjects had a positive PCR On the first visit, eight (50%) of the test-positive subjects had no symptoms and only one (6 2%) sought healthcare or missed school or work None of the subjects that tested negative on the first visit were positive on their second While our results show a relatively low rate of test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 amongst first responders, most were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic The potential risk of asymptomatic transmission both between first responders and from first responders to vulnerable patients requires more study","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Serially Tested Emergency Medical Services Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has impacted various aspects of life and business.

Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected from patients' medical records. Also, the chest computed tomography (CT) score was defined by the summation of individual scores from 5 lung lobes: scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were respectively assigned for each lobe if pulmonary involvement was 0%, less than 5%, 5%-25%, 26%-49%, 50%-75%, or more than 75% of each region. RESULTS: Among all patients with diabetes, 93 (79.5%) patients had poorly-controlled diabetes and 24 (20.5%) had well-controlled diabetes; 66 (56.4%) patients were male and the median age was 66 years (IQR, 55-75 years). The chest CT severity scores were not significantly different between patients with well-controlled diabetes and those with poorly-controlled diabetes (p = 0.33).

It helps connect online communities regardless of one's geographical location and time zone. During the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia, the use of online learning platforms has become a crucial option for accomplishing learning objectives. During this challenging time, universities have been looking for suitable solutions to address issues regarding the online learning process. This paper discusses the challenges in online learning, as well as the importance of collaborative learning activities during the Movement Control Order (MCO). Challenges in emotion and changes of routine among students have been detected during the MCO imposed by the government of Malaysia. Methodology - An exploratory sequential approach was carried out in this study to obtain students' feedback in terms of their emotions and routine changes during the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent implementation of the MCO. Convenience sampling was used for this research, and in order to obtain feedback on online learning during the MCO an online interview was conducted with 42 students from the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA branch in the state of Kelantan. The feedback items were recorded and transcribed in Excel format. Next, sentiment analysis was carried out using Rapidminer software. Findings - The results showed that higher education institutions or universities had to play their part in providing a virtual learning environment as convenient as possible during the Movement Control Order period. The results also showed that educators had to ensure the success of online learning by maintaining the motivation of their students Significance - The findings in this study can also benefit educators and higher education institutions or universities in executing suitable teaching and learning plans during the COVID-19 outbreak. ? 2021.

We modeled the number of mechanical ventilators that could be used in addition to the number of hospital-based ventilators currently in use. METHODS: We identified key components of the health care system needed to deliver ventilation therapy, quantified the maximum number of additional ventilators that each key component could support at various capacity levels (ie, conventional, contingency, and crisis), and determined the constraining key component at each capacity level. RESULTS: Our study results showed that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 and 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national influenza pandemic outbreak with robust pre-pandemic planning. CONCLUSIONS: The current US health care system may have limited capacity to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency.

The aim was to explore how these care services have adapted during the pandemic in the UK and are providing care to people living with dementia (PLWD) and carers. METHOD Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in June and July 2020 with 16 purposefully sampled unpaid dementia carers. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing care services since the lockdown, and whether they were beneficial, if accessed at all. RESULTS Three themes were identified: (1) Impacts of no activities; (2) Difficulties accessing care during the pandemic; (3) Remote vs. face-to-face support. Loss of access to previously enjoyed activities and having had to shield for many PLWD is suggested to have led to severe physical and cognitive deteriorations, advancing the dementia. Where remote support was available, this was helpful to some, but did not replace the benefits of face-to-face support. Where PLWD were residing in a care home, carers had very limited remote access. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to explore the impact on carers both from a community and institutionalised care angle. Few care services have adapted to providing remote support. With the vaccine taking time to be accessible to everyone, it is vital for organisations to work closely with carers and PLWD to adapt services to provide much needed support.","output":"Navigating the new normal: accessing community and institutionalised care for dementia during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conspiracy theories tend to thrive in moments of crises because they provide simple answers that assist individuals in coping with threats, making the world more understandable. The COVID-19 pandemic is such a crisis and is boosted by the political turmoil related to politicization of the pandemic in some countries. To assess the role of political partisanship, conspiracy beliefs, and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in our two criterion variables (support for COVID-19 prevention measures and compliance with social distancing), we applied an online questionnaire to 662 participants. We have used regression analyses to examine the data collected. Our results indicate that political partisanship predicts conspiracy theories involving personal wellbeing (PW) and control of information (CI) but not government malfeasance (GM) ones. Political partisanship predicted support to COVID-19 prevention measures while intolerance of uncertainty predicted past compliance with social distancing. Beliefs in GM theories predicted support to COVID-19 prevention measures and non-compliance with social distancing while beliefs in PW and CI only predicted non-compliance with social distancing. Belief in GM, PW, and CI theories moderated the effect of political partisanship on support to COVID-19 prevention measures whereas belief in GM and PW theories moderated the effect of IU on past non-compliance with social distancing. Overall, our results suggest the relevance of diminishing political polarization around the virus, providing basic scientific knowledge to the general population to make it easier to identify fake data and conspiracy theories, and offering psychological support focused on dealing with uncertainty to assist in increasing endorsement of and compliance with prevention measures.","output":"COVID-19 as an Undesirable Political Issue: Conspiracy Beliefs and Intolerance of Uncertainty Predict Adhesion to Prevention Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 44-year-old woman underwent a sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer in March 2002.

This review aims to assess the impact of surgical resection on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. All studies assessing QOL using validated questionnaires in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing surgical resection were included. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were assessed. Patients reported a decrease in physical, social and global scales within the first 3 months after surgery. These values showed improvement and were comparable to baseline values by 6 months. Recovery in emotional functioning towards baseline figures was demonstrated in the first 3 months post-operatively. Symptom scales including pain, fatigue and diarrhoea deteriorated after surgery, but reverted to baseline after 3-6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection for pancreatic cancer has short-term negative impact on QOL. In the longer term, this will improve and eventually recover to baseline values after 6 months.

This study examined the role played by the HCV p7 protein in the induction of cell-death. By measuring caspase-3/7 activation and cleavage of endogenous PARP, two hallmarks of apoptosis, the overexpression of p7 protein was shown to induce apoptosis in Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, p7-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Similar to the M2 protein of influenza A virus, p7-induced apoptosis is independent of its ion channel activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments further showed that both M2 and p7 interact with the essential autophagy protein Beclin-1. However, only the M2 protein could cause an increase in the level of LC3-II, which is an indicator of autophagic activity. Thus, although the p7 protein is functionally similar to the well-characterized M2 protein, they differ in their activation of autophagic cell-death.

was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 625mg three times daily and doxycycline 100mg once daily Hydroxycholoroquine was not given in view of G6PD deficiency There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a short-acting insulin sliding scale was initiated at 2U/hr Continuous positive pressure ventilation was offered for next 72 hours, however the patient failed to improve and required transfer to intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation Computer tomography scan of pulmonary artery excluded embolism The patient was fed via nasogastric tube post intubation On day 8, the patient experienced a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels from 132 g/dl on day 1 to 68 g/dl, requiring multiple blood transfusions The blood results demonstrated evidence of haemolysis with a rise in total and direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels The peripheral blood smear showed numerous bite cells with polychromasia suggesting an acute haemolytic crisis in the context of

Microbiome changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but a clear relationship between viral infection and IBD has not been established. Case description/methods: Case 1 A 45-year-old woman presented to clinic with painless hematochezia and fecal urgency 2 weeks after developing anosmia and being diagnosed with COVID-19. She had a history of constipation but no other gastrointestinal problems. Her vital signs were normal and her exam was unremarkable. Her labs showed iron deficiency anemia with hemoglobin 10.2 and ferritin <2. Colonoscopy showed 10cm of moderately friable rectal mucosa with erosions and loss of vascular pattern. Rectal pathology showed chronic active proctitis. She was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis and treated with mesalamine suppositories with resolution of her symptoms. Case 2 A 48- year-old woman was admitted for five months of watery, bloody bowel movements that developed after an initial hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. She reported 10-15 bowel movements daily, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and 10kg weight loss. She was initially diagnosed with C. difficile at another hospital but her symptoms did not improve with oral vancomycin. She was mildly tachycardic, but her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Labs showed hemoglobin 6.7, CRP 6.9, ESR 50, and fecal calprotectin 1880. C. difficile testing was negative. Colonoscopy showed pancolitis with moderate inflammation, edema, erosions, erythema, and friability most severe in the distal colon with ileal sparing. Pathology showed crypt architectural distortion and branching with cryptitis and crypt abscesses consistent with ulcerative colitis. After not responding to prednisone, she achieved clinical remission with infliximab. Discussion: Prior research has described the role of abnormal immune response to intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Some studies have found an increased risk of IBD after infectious gastroenteritis, but no specific causal link has been demonstrated and the role of specific infections in the development of the dysregulated immune response is incompletely understood. These cases of new ulcerative colitis diagnosed after COVID-19 infection have implications for understanding potential viral triggers of IBD.","output":"COVID-19: A potential trigger for inflammatory bowel disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adrenal insufficiency may put a person at higher risk with infections due to a lack of normal stress response by the body. Limited data has been available in pediatric adrenal insufficiency with Covid-19 Methods: We used TriNetX, with a large COVID-19 database, collecting real-time electronic medical records data. We compared children (0-18 years) who were diagnosed with Covid-19 with and without Adrenal insufficiency. This database collected information from 54 health care organizations Results: Mortality rate in children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 2.246% (19/846).

Hotels and other facilities have been adapted to help appropriate isolation be achieved. Our study tested the efficacy of isolating patients in a reconditioned hotel versus isolation in their domiciles to reduce infection transmission. METHODS: Observational cohort study based on a survey to COVID-19 patients between April and June 2020. One cohort had been isolated in a hotel and the other in their domiciles. Multivariate regression models analyzed the factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19 infection among the household members. RESULTS: A total of 229 household members of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, 139 of them belonging to the group of hotel-isolated patients and 90 in the group of domicile-isolated ones. More than half of the household members became infected (53.7%). Higher risk of infection was found in the household members of domicile-isolated patients isolated and in those reporting overcrowding at home, (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89C3.12) and (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.81; 2.56), respectively.

Researchers contacted participants by phone or by post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic restrictions had impacted health, Covid-19 experiences, perceived social support, employment and loneliness. Loneliness was measured by the three item UCLA loneliness scale. Findings In the pandemic sub-cohort, 367 adults with a severe mental ill health diagnosis completed a remote survey. 29-34% of participants reported being lonely. Loneliness was associated with being younger in age (adjusted OR = -.98, p = .02), living alone (adjusted OR = 2.04, p = .01), high levels of social and economic deprivation (adjusted OR = 2.49, p = .04), and lower perceived social support (B = -5.86, p < .001). Living alone was associated with lower perceived social support. Being lonely was associated with a self-reported deterioration in mental health during the pandemic (adjusted OR = 3.46, 95%CI 2.03-5.91). Practical implications Intervention strategies to tackle loneliness in the severe mental ill health population are needed. Further research is needed to follow-up the severe mental ill health population after pandemic restrictions are lifted to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends. Originality Loneliness was a substantial problem for the severe mental ill health population before the Covid-19 pandemic but there is limited evidence to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends during the pandemic.","output":"Loneliness among people with severe mental ill health during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a linked UK population cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE Amyand hernia is a rare disease seen in approximatively 1% of all hernias, complications of it, like acute appendicitis, or perforated appendicitis are even more rare, about 0.1%.

Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has resulted in significant economic losses in many Asian swine-raising countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. However, from April 2013 to the present, major outbreaks of PEDV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Moreover, intercontinental transmission of PEDV has increased mortality rates in seronegative neonatal piglets, resulting in 10% loss of the US pig population. The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV indicates that the virus is able to evade current vaccine strategies. Continuous emergence of multiple mutant strains from several regions has aggravated porcine epidemic diarrhea endemic conditions and highlighted the need for new vaccines based on the current circulating PEDV. Epidemic PEDV strains tend to be more pathogenic and cause increased death in pigs, thereby causing substantial financial losses for swine producers.

Study selection Both clinical and in vitro studies were included in the data search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly identified. Study selection was carried out in two phases by two independent reviewers. The studies included fitted the following criteria: studies that hypothesised the use of mouthwashes as a form of intervention to decrease the viral load in saliva contaminated with coronavirus. Two other studies were included in this review and both were conducted in Germany, performed in vitro, which tested povidone-iodine (PVP-I) mouthwash at two different concentrations: 1% and 7%. Both studies used the same culture mediums for clean and dirty conditions, and the evaluated outcome was the viral titre of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The studies were published in 2015 and 2018. Neither study evaluated the action of this mouthwash on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction and synthesis The extraction of data followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline process. Studies chosen for analysis included assessment of the following data parameters for risk of bias: cell origin and cell type used, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure, magnetic flux density of exposure, environmental background magnetic field, use of control treatment, temperature control, blinding of exposure, randomisation of exposure, measurement of cell vitality, identical methods for control and exposure groups, randomisation of data measurements and potential industry sponsorship. Results One study assessed the effect of the mouthwash on MERS-CoV and the other on both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In both studies, following 15 seconds of exposure to the mouthwash, a reduction in viral load of >99.99% was seen. There was a measurable reduction in viral titre in the samples, with one study reporting a reduction to 4.30 log10 TCID50/ml from 6.00-6.50 log10 TCID50/ml.

Interventions aimed at improving staff's self-efficacy, adoption of positive coping strategies, and avoidance of negative coping strategies or considerations of social support along with coping strategies are suggested to decrease exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Adhering to the Cochrane guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and searched three major medical databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase), complemented by hand search. We included 26 (three longitudinal and 23 cross-sectional) population-based studies of good quality (using a validated quality assessment tool), with data from 3,128,877 participants in total. The longest of these studies, a Swedish national register evaluation with 25 years follow-up, showed a higher incidence of mental illness among the self-employed compared to white-collar workers, but a lower incidence compared to blue-collar workers. In the second longitudinal study from Sweden the self-employed had a lower incidence of mental illness compared to both blue- and white-collar workers over 15 years, whereas the third longitudinal study (South Korea) did not find a difference regarding the incidence of depressive symptoms over 6 years. Results from the cross-sectional studies showed associations between self-employment and poor general mental health and stress, but were inconsistent regarding other mental outcomes. Most studies from South Korea found a higher prevalence of mental disorders among the self-employed compared to employees, whereas the results of cross-sectional studies from outside Asia were less consistent. In conclusion, we found evidence from population-based studies for a link between self-employment and increased risk of mental illness. Further longitudinal studies are needed examining the potential risk for the development of mental disorders in specific subtypes of the self-employed.","output":"Occurrence of Mental Illness and Mental Health Risks among the Self-Employed: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses cause annual seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics; vaccination is the most effective countermeasure. Intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) are needle-free, mimic the natural route of infection, and elicit robust immunity. However, some LAIVs require reconstitution and cold-chain requirements restrict storage and distribution of all influenza vaccines. We generated a dry-powder, thermostable LAIV (T-LAIV) using Preservation by Vaporization technology and assessed the stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of T-LAIV alone or combined with delta inulin adjuvant (Advax?) in ferrets. Stability assays demonstrated minimal loss of T-LAIV titer when stored at 25 C for 1 year. Vaccination of ferrets with T-LAIV alone or with delta inulin adjuvant elicited mucosal antibody and robust serum HI responses in ferrets, and was protective against homologous challenge. These results suggest that the Preservation by Vaporization-generated dry-powder vaccines could be distributed without refrigeration and administered without reconstitution or injection.

This +,-,-,+ arrangement gives the peptide its name, MagicWand (MW). As judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, MW assembles to alpha-helical structures in the sub-micromolar range and above. The thermal unfolding of MW is reversible with a melting temperature >70 degrees C at 100 muM peptide concentration. Negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of MW assemblies reveals stiff, straight, fibrous rods that extended for tens of microns. Moreover, different stains highlight considerable order both perpendicular and parallel to the fiber long axis. The dimensions of these features are consistent with bundles of long, straight coiled alpha-helical coiled coils with their axes aligned parallel to the long axis of the fibers. The fiber thickening indicates inter-coiled-coil interactions. Mutagenesis of the outer surface of the peptide i.e., at the b and f positionscombined with stability and microscopy measurements, highlights the role of electrostatic and cation-pi interactions in driving fiber formation, stability and thickening.

Likewise, women suffered from a higher increase in stress and reduction in social encounters than men. Younger early chronotypes did not increase their sleep duration and exhibited the highest drop in mood.

They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity.

The objective of this study was to assess the craving and withdrawal coping mechanisms used by patients with SUDs as a result of disruption in availability of substances and medications due to sudden lockdown in response to coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS A survey was administered via telephone from June 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020, to patients who had previously attended the substance use clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India from January 1, 2020, to March 21, 2020 (up to the time of lockdown). Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained from case record files. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to collect information on coping with craving and withdrawal symptoms. A total of 215 patients were registered in the substance use clinic during this period for the treatment of SUDs, and of those, 43 could not be contacted due to various reasons such as wrong contact numbers, patient expired (not related to substance withdrawal), or not willing to talk. The mean age of the subjects was 37.05 (SD = 13.22) years, and men outnumbered women. The remaining 172 patients were contacted via telephone, and responses were gathered regarding withdrawal symptoms and coping with craving. RESULTS More than two-thirds of the patients were still maintaining abstinence from their primary substance of abuse during lockdown. A large number of patients (n = 41, 43.2%) reported difficulty in obtaining prescribed medication for detoxification without renewal of their prescription. More than 66% of patients reported that they were able to control their craving, and many kept themselves busy with household activities. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients who had completed the acute phase of withdrawals were able to maintain abstinence in the absence of renewal of prescribed medication and substance of abuse due to sudden disruption in supply.

Finally, we identify a fundamental tension between the intra- and inter-team layers: the collaboration technology and practices that help individual teams thrive (e.g., adopting customized collaboration software) can also prompt collaboration challenges in the inter-team layer, and conversely the technology and practices that facilitate inter-team collaboration (e.g., strong centralized IT organizations) can harm practices at the intra-team layer.

Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. Methods Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken between Feb. 17 and Apr. 23, 2020, during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Denmark. The double test was taken as part of the first trimester risk assessment. Cohort 2 included women with a first trimester pregnancy loss before double test. Serum from the double test or from a blood sample, in case of pregnancy loss, was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses. Results In total, 1,019 pregnant women with double test and 36 women with pregnancy loss participated in the study. Thirty (2.9%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test. All women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were no significant differences in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive (n=14) versus negative (p=0.20) or grey zone (n=16) versus negative (p=0.28). In total, 54 women experienced a pregnancy loss of whom two had grey zone or positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Formative research seeking an understanding of weak vaccination intentions is urgently needed. METHODS: Nationwide online survey of 804 U.S. English-speaking adults. Compensated participants were recruited from the U.S. through an internet survey panel of 2.5 million residents developed by a commercial survey firm. Recruitment was based on quota sampling to produce a U.S. Census-matched sample representative of the nation with regard to region of residence, sex, and age. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination intentions were weak, with 14.8% of respondents being unlikely to get vaccinated and another 23.0% unsure. Intent to vaccinate was highest for men, older people, individuals who identified as white and non-Hispanic, the affluent and college-educated, Democrats, those who were married or partnered, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and those vaccinated against influenza during the 2019-2020 flu season. In a multiple linear regression, significant predictors of vaccination intent were general vaccine knowledge (? = 0.311, p < .001), rejection of vaccine conspiracies (? = -0.117, p = .003), perceived severity of COVID-19 (? = 0.273, p < .001), influenza vaccine uptake (? = 0.178, p < .001), having &#8805; 5 pre-existing conditions (? = 0.098, p = .003), being male (? = 0.119, p < .001), household income of &#8805; $120,000 (? = 0.110, p = .004), identifying as a Democrat (? = 0.075, p < .029), and not relying upon social media for virus information (? = -0.090, p 002).

Here, we interrogate some shortcomings of metadata within the GISAID database to raise awareness of common errors and inconsistencies that may affect data-driven analyses and provide possible avenues for resolutions. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a startling prevalence of spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions, which together occur in an estimated ~ 9.8% and ~ 11.6% of \\"originating lab\\" and \\"submitting lab\\" GISAID metadata entries respectively.

The patients were classified into asymptomatic, non-severe and severe disease groups. The symptoms, laboratory results, hospital follow-ups and intensive-care records of the patients and the findings of new borns are presented. Results Most of the patients (78%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy, and 103 patients in the study group had severe disease. Fever in the non-severe group and respiratory distress in the severe group were the most common symptoms in the patients. The severe clinical manifestations were specifically observed in the third trimester patients. In the severe group, neutrophil, lactat dehydrogenase, ferritin, CK-MB, IL-6 and hospital stay were statistically higher than those in other groups (p < 0.05). Increase in BUN and creatine were the most predictive parameters in intensive care admission. While the intensive care unit (ICU) requirement was higher in patients in the severe group, premature birth was observed more frequently in the severe group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Observably, COVID-19 positive pregnant women were mostly detected in the third trimester, and the disease was more severe in this period.

Increased risk of severe disease occurs during secondary infection with a virus serotype distinct from that of prior dengue infection. This occurs by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, wherein sub-neutralizing antibodies against the virus particles opsonize dengue virus entry via formation of immune complexes that interact with fragment crystallizable gamma receptors (FcR) on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The ADE phenomenon has two components: Extrinsic and Intrinsic ADE. While extrinsic ADE contributes to enhanced virus entry, intrinsic ADE results in heightened virus production by inhibition of type1 interferon and activation of interleukin-10 biosynthesis, thereby favoring a Th2 type immune response. Intrinsic ADE has greater contribution in enhancing Dengue replication as compared to extrinsic ADE. Detailed elucidation of intrinsic ADE during secondary dengue infection can increase our understanding of DENV-pathogenesis and aid in the development of host-targeting antivirals.

SPMs act when uncontrolled inflammatory processes are developed, for instance, in patients of COVID-19 or other diseases. The so-called resolution pharmacology aims at developing new treatments based on the use of SPMs as agonists, which promote inflammation resolution without unwanted side effects. It has been shown that the biosynthesis of SPMs called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived E-series resolvins is initiated by aspirin-acetylated COX-2 from EPA, leading to 18-hydroperoxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (18-HpEPE). However, there are many open questions concerning the intriguing role of aspirin in the molecular mechanism of resolvin formation. Our MD simulations, combined with QM/MM calculations, show that the potential energy barriers for the H16-abstraction from EPA, required for forming 18-HpEPE, are higher than for the H13-abstraction, thus explaining why 18-HpEPE is a marginal product of COX-2 catalysis. By contrast, in the aspirin-acetylated COX-2/EPA complex, the H16proS-abstraction energy barriers are somewhat lower than the H13proS energy barriers and much smaller than the H16-transfer barriers in the wild type COX-2/EPA system. Those results agree with the experimental observation that aspirin favours the synthesis of several SPMs known as aspirin-triggered resolvins. In the following step of the catalytic mechanism, the calculated O2 addition to C18 is preferred versus the addition to C14 which also agrees with 18R-HEPE and 18S-HEPE being the main products from EPA in aspirin-acetylated COX-2.","output":"The role of acetylated cyclooxygenase-2 in the biosynthesis of resolvin precursors derived from eicosapentaenoic acid."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Farmers and farm workers are critical to the secure supply of food, yet this population is potentially at high risk to acquire COVID-19.

Partial or full-thickness rectal injuries can occur during the introduction and the advancement of the circular stapler along the upper rectum. The aim of this study is to address some of these issues by designing and optimizing a \\"phantom\\" anvil manufactured to overcome difficulties throughout the rectal introduction and advancement of the circular stapler for the treatment of benign and malignant colon disease. METHODS The design of the \\"phantom\\" anvil has been performed using computer-aided modeling techniques, finite element investigations, and 2 essential keynotes in mind. The first one is the internal shape of the anvil, which is used for the connection to the gun. The second is the shape of the cap, which makes possible the insertion of the gun through the rectum. The \\"phantom\\" anvil has 2 functional requirements, which have been taken into account. The design has been optimized to avoid colorectal injuries, neoplastic dissemination (ie, mechanical seeding) and to reduce the fecal contamination. RESULTS Numerical simulations show that a right combination of both top and bottom fillet radii of the shape of the anvil can reduce the stress for the considered anatomic configuration of >90%.

In this context, the aim of the study is to determine preservice mathematics teachers' conceptual-procedural knowledge level competencies and general thoughts about distance education in the distance education probability course in the department of mathematics teaching. In the study, a questionnaire consisting of 18 questions was prepared in the light of the literature as a data collection tool for 52 preservice mathematics teachers who took the probability course with distance education in the 2020-2021 academic year. After the implementations, one-to-one interviews were made with the lecturer conducting the course. The data of the study were analysed with the descriptive analysis method. As a result, it was determined that the conceptual-operative knowledge of the preservice mathematics teachers in the probability course in the distance education process was at a medium level. Although it was determined that the participation in online lessons was quite low compared to the lessons taught face-to-face, the preservice teachers mostly followed the lessons from asynchronous recordings, but there was no low performance or unwillingness in the preservice teachers who attended the lessons online. It has been determined that the biggest problem with distance education is the internet access and the low reliability of evaluation process.

Many people who smoke cigarettes have used e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, and the general consensus among health providers is that while vaping is not harmless, it is less harmful than smoking. To try to reduce youth e-cigarette use, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts imposed a 75% excise tax on nicotine-containing vaping products and banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including combustible tobacco, effective June 1, 2020. This tax, like similar taxes in other states, aimed to reduce e-cigarette consumption. However, past research has found that e-cigarettes and cigarettes are economic substitutes, meaning that an increase in e-cigarettes prices may push more people who smoke e-cigarettes to smoke combustible cigarettes. METHODS: To determine the impacts of several events, such as the e-cigarette and vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak and implementation of the Massachusetts e-cigarette tax, on e-cigarette and cigarette purchasing, we conducted an interrupted time-series analysis of year-on-year consumer purchasing data to impute changes in e-cigarette and cigarette purchasing in the Greater Boston area and the entire USA after several intervention points. We then surveyed a subset of people who used e-cigarettes to evaluate the plausibility that some e-cigarette consumers would travel out-of-state to purchase e-cigarettes. RESULTS: The purchasing data indicated that there was no significant decrease in e-cigarette purchases in the Greater Boston convenience market after tax implementation. However, we found that e-cigarette purchases decreased significantly while cigarette purchases increased after several bans on e-cigarettes and numerous policy statements related to the EVALI outbreak. The survey results suggested that people who smoke e-cigarettes did not decrease their consumption after the implementation of the tax, but instead obtained e-cigarettes outside of Massachusetts. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Massachusetts flavor ban and tax did not reduce e-cigarette consumption in the Greater Boston area, and that messaging questioning the safety of e-cigarettes led to an increase in combustible cigarette use. This suggests the need for health authorities to reconsider how they communicate the relative risks of smoking and vaping.

The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two na?ve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-m and an 8-m aerodynamic diameter.

We use operative data from a large international non-government cleft organization to compare case volume for 2019 and 2020 to quantify the impact of COVID-19. Methods: Smile Train supports a partner network of over 1100 partners globally to deliver treatment to children with cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP). Treatment data is documented into a proprietary digital platform, Smile Train Express. We compared monthly treatment data for 2019 to 2020, by country, and by World Bank Income group to describe the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on CLP surgery in LMICs. Results: Our analysis shows 25,444 (31.4%) fewer primary operations performed between January and December 2020 than in the same period in 2019 with the most significant decline in procedures observed in April 2020. Many countries resumed elective surgery for CLP procedures from May onward and volume approximated that of pre-pandemic baseline by November of 2020. Conclusions: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on health systems and service delivery across the world. We find that this is evident in the delivery of CLP surgery in LMICs.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here, we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate, with B.1.1.7 vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus.

Contact tracing is not that useful if all other interventions have been fully deployed. The number of infected individuals could be halved if people reduced their close contact rate by 25%. For reducing transmission, students should be prioritized for vaccination rather than retired older people and preschool aged children.

We hypothesized that (1) the association between stress and sleep disturbance would differ across prefrontal cortex activation during emotion regulation (moderation model) and (2) the indirect effects of stress on depressive symptoms through sleep disturbance would depend on prefrontal cortex activation during emotion regulation (moderated mediation model). METHODS Forty-eight healthy adults without sleep disorders based on nocturnal polysomnography participated in this study. They received functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while performing an emotion regulation task. They also completed questionnaires assessing life stress, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms. The proposed models were tested using the PROCESS macro for SPSS.

Furthermore, right lateral prefrontal cortex activation had a moderating role in the indirect effect of life stress on depressive symptoms through sleep disturbance.

However, cognitive decline may be a complication following all types of AIH. This systematic review will summarize longitudinal observational studies documenting cognitive changes following AIH in the majority admitted population and conduct meta-analysis (MA) to assess the quantitative effect of AIH on post-hospitalization cognitive decline (PHCD). METHODS: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Selection criteria were defined to identify studies of older age adults exposed to AIH with cognitive measures. 6566 titles were screened. 46 reports were reviewed qualitatively, of which seven contributed data to the MA. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The qualitative review suggested increased cognitive decline following AIH, but several reports were particularly vulnerable to bias. Domain-specific outcomes following AIH included declines in memory and processing speed. Increasing age and the severity of illness were the most consistent risk factors for PHCD.

RESULTS: 28 PID patients were included in this study. 10 of 28 (35.7%) had HPV-DNA in their genital swabs. 6 patients had high-risk HPV-types (21.4%). Most patients had asymptomatic HPV-infections, as genital warts were rare (2 of 28 patients) and HPV-associated malignancy was absent. Differences in the HPV-positivity regarding clinical PID-diagnosis, duration of PID, age, sex, immunosuppression, immunoglobulin replacement, or circumcision in males were not present. HPV-positive PID patients had higher numbers of T cells (CD3(+)), of cytotoxic T cells (CD3(+)/CD8(+)), of transitional B cells (CD19(+)/CD38(++)/CD10(+)/IgD(+)), and of plasmablasts (CD19(+)/CD38(+)/CD27(++)/IgD(-)) compared to HPV-negative. CONCLUSION: PID patients exhibit a high rate of genital HPV-infections with a high rate of high-risk HPV-types. Regular screening for symptomatic genital HPV-infection and HPV-associated malignancy in PID patients seems recommendable.","output":"High Prevalence of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Patients With Primary Immunodeficiencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The modulatory effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are highly variable between subjects. This variability may be due to uncontrolled caffeine consumption and circadian rhythms. Therefore, here we studied if caffeine consumption, systemically available caffeine measured in saliva, and daytime have effects on the excitability and plasticity of the motor cortex. Since both, time of the day and caffeine may mediate their effects via cortisol, we also quantified corticosteroids in saliva. Experiment 1 was performed in caffeine-na?ve participants (n = 30) and compared the effects of PAS or tACS with different stimulation intensities on the motor cortex with or without caffeine 200 mg administered in a double-blind fashion. Experiment 2 was performed in regular caffeine consumers (n = 30) and compared the influence of time of day on the effects of tACS (true or sham) on the motor cortex also with or without caffeine administered in a double-blind fashion. Caffeine increased the saliva corticosteroid concentrations in both experimental groups, and corticosteroid concentrations were higher in the morning in caffeine consumers. Gender also affected corticosteroid concentrations. There was a positive correlation between caffeine concentrations and baseline cortical excitability in caffeine-adapted participants, and a negative correlation between poststimulation caffeine concentrations and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes after sham stimulation in caffeine-na?ve subjects. No correlations were found between poststimulation caffeine or corticosteroid concentrations, and plasticity aftereffects. PAS and tACS did not elicit changes in the corticosteroid concentrations. We conclude that moderate caffeine consumption alters cortical excitability but not plasticity aftereffects.

Designing digital health technologies to support caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation requires evaluating their engagement with these technologies. The objective of this study was to examine the association between caregiving characteristics and different types of digital health technologies used. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional, national survey of 948 unpaid family caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. Results: Almost two-thirds (65.4%) of respondents reported using an app for fitness or step counting, while 41.3% reported using a smartwatch. The average number of apps used was 3.3 (range 0-9). In adjusted models, adult children who were caregivers (OR=5.82, p<0.005) and caregivers of another relative (OR=2.51, p<0.005) were significantly more likely to use a fitness tracker than caregivers of a child. Caregiving for six months or greater was associated with use of fewer apps compared with caregiving for less than six months in adjusted models (OR=0.80, p<0.005). Caregivers of patients receiving an allogeneic transplant used more apps on average than caregivers of patients receiving an autologous transplant, in adjusted (OR=1.36, p<0.005) models. Conclusion: Digital health technologies may reflect promising avenues for supporting caregivers of patients undergoing HCT.

However, many students with disabilities are precluded from entering and completing medical training due to historically restrictive technical standards and poor internal practices to protect student privacy. This limits the possibilities for growing this part of the workforce and making progress toward the ultimate goal of having a physician workforce that better represents the patients it serves. To achieve diversity among the physician workforce, medical education must create environments that allow students with disabilities to apply to, flourish in, and feel well supported in medical school. Recent additions to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements have helped to catalyze work in the area of disability inclusion by incorporating disability-focused mandates into graduate medical education accreditation standards. However, similar mandates for undergraduate medical education have not yet materialized. In this article, the authors call for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to elevate disability as a valued part of medical school diversity in its accreditation standards and to include protections for disabled students. The authors propose that the LCME can take 5 actions to promote institutional accountability toward students with disabilities: (1) define disability as diversity, (2) mandate disability support, (3) protect from conflicts of interest, (4) protect privacy, and (5) verify schools' technical standards comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study at the University Hospital Basel, we included all patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection hospitalised from 27 February 2020 to 10 May 2021. Patients&rsquo; characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record system. The primary outcome of this study was temporal trends of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality in patients hospitalised on the intensive care unit (ICU), admission to ICU, renal replacement therapy and length of hospital stay, as well as a descriptive analysis of risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period we included 943 hospitalisations of 930 patients. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 53&ndash;76) and 63% were men. The numbers of elderly patients, patients with multiple comorbidities and need for renal replacement therapy decreased from the first and second to the third wave. The median length of stay and need for ICU admission were similar in all waves. Throughout the study period 88 patients (9.3%) died during the hospital stay. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar over the course of the first two waves (9.5% and 10.2%, respectively), whereas it decreased in the third wave (5.4%). Overall mortality in patients without comorbidities was low at 1.6%, but it increased in patients with any comorbidity to 12.6%. Predictors of all-cause mortality over the whole period were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 10-year increase 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45&ndash;2.26; p &lt;0.001), male sex (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00&ndash;2.82; p = 0.048), immunocompromising condition (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.01&ndash;4.33; p = 0.048) and chronic kidney disease (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.35&ndash;3.76; p = 0.002).

This abrupt change, seen in response to unprecedented medical and environmental challenges, has been forced upon the orthopaedic community. However, such changes to adopting virtual care and technology were already in the evolution forecast, albeit in an unpredictable timetable impeded by regulatory and financial barriers. This adoption is not meant to replace, but rather augment established, traditional models of care while ensuring patient/provider safety, especially during the pandemic. While our department, like those of other institutions, has performed virtual care for several years, it represented a small fraction of daily care. The pandemic required an accelerated and comprehensive approach to the new reality. Contemporary literature has already shown equivalent safety and patient satisfaction, as well as superior efficiency and reduced expenses with musculoskeletal virtual care (MSKVC) versus traditional models. Nevertheless, current literature detailing operational models of MSKVC is scarce. The current review describes our pre-pandemic MSKVC model and the shift to a MSKVC pandemic workflow that enumerates the conceptual workflow organization (patient triage, from timely care provision based on symptom acuity/severity to a continuum that includes future follow-up). Furthermore, specific setup requirements (both resource/personnel requirements such as hardware, software, and network connectivity requirements, and patient/provider characteristics respectively), and professional expectations are outlined. MSKVC has already become a pivotal element of musculoskeletal care, due to COVID-19, and these changes are confidently here to stay. Readiness to adapt and evolve will be required of individual musculoskeletal clinical teams as well as organizations, as established paradigms evolve.

We investigated incidence and clinical characteristics of influenza in children admitted to PICUs during the first three post-pandemic influenza seasons, using active screening. METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study in 24 PICUs in Bavaria (Germany) from October 2010 to September 2013. Influenza cases among children between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to these PICUs with acute respiratory infection were confirmed by PCR analysis of respiratory secretions. RESULTS: A total of 24/7/20 influenza-associated PICU admissions were recorded in the post-pandemic seasons 1/2/3; incidence estimates per 100,000 children were 1.72/0.76/1.80, respectively. Of all 51 patients, 80 % had influenza A, including 65 % with A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was almost absent in season 2 (incidence 0.11), but dominated PICU admissions in seasons 1 (incidence 1.35) and 3 (incidence 1.17). Clinical data was available for 47 influenza patients; median age was 4.8 years (IQR 1.6C11.0). The most frequent diagnoses were influenza-associated pneumonia (62 %), bronchitis/bronchiolitis (32 %), secondary bacterial pneumonia (26 %), and ARDS (21 %). Thirty-six patients (77 %) had underlying medical conditions. Median duration of PICU stay was 3 days (IQR 1C11). Forty-seven per cent of patients received mechanical ventilation, and one patient (2 %) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 19 % were treated with oseltamivir. Five children (11 %) had pulmonary sequelae. Five children (11 %) died; all had underlying chronic conditions and were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09. In season 3, patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 were younger than in season 1 (p = 0.020), were diagnosed more often with bronchitis/bronchiolitis (p = 0.004), and were admitted to a PICU later after the onset of influenza symptoms (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Active screening showed a continued high incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions in the post-pandemic seasons 1 and 3, and indicated possible underestimation of incidence in previous German studies. The age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children may be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population. The high proportion of patients with underlying chronic conditions indicates the importance of consistent implementation of the current influenza vaccination recommendations for risk groups in Germany.","output":"Continued high incidence of children with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 admitted to paediatric intensive care units in Germany during the first three post-pandemic influenza seasons, 2010/11C2012/13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In this study we evaluated the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among intubated patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluated different case definitions of invasive aspergillosis.

All included participants underwent screening protocol for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan and cultures performed on admission at 7 days and in case of clinical deterioration. Cases were classified as coronavirus associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) according to previous consensus definitions. The new definition was compared with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (PIPA). RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were enrolled. Probable CAPA was diagnosed in 30 (27.7%) of patients after a median of 4 (2-8) days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant higher 30-day mortality rate from ICU admission among patients with either CAPA (44% vs 19%, p= 0.002) or PIPA (74% vs 26%, p<0.001) when compared with patients not fulfilling criteria for aspergillosis.

However, these immunological adaptations may also make pregnant women vulnerable to developing adverse complications from respiratory viral infections. While the influenza and SARS pandemics support this theory, there is less certainty regarding the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development is key to public preventative strategies. Whilst most viral vaccines are able to induce a seroprotective antibody response, in some high-risk individuals this may not correlate with clinical protection. Some studies have shown that factors such as age, gender, and chronic illnesses can reduce their effectiveness and in this review, we discuss how pregnancy may affect the efficacy and immunogenicity of vaccines. We present literature to support the hypothesis that pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory viral infections and may not respond to vaccines as effectively. In particular, we focus on the clinical implications of important respiratory viral infections such as influenza during pregnancy, and the pregnancy induced alterations in important leukocytes such as TFH, cTFH and B cells, which play an important role in generating long-lasting and high-affinity antibodies.

Findings support the reliability of the d2 Test, a cancelation test of attention and concentration, to induce parasympathetic withdrawal and extend prior work on \\"vagal flexibility\\". Further, these findings suggest a pattern of group differences in ANS functioning in children with ADHD, with and without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Only the ADHD without comorbid anxiety group showed a normative autonomic response to the cognitive challenge (reduced HF-HRV). The participants did not display an adaptive process of restoration following the cognitive challenge; the HRV suppression was prolonged during post-task recovery period, suggesting that ANS responded as if the cognitive stressor was still present. The current paper covers and discusses theoretical implications for the abnormalities in neurophysiological functioning and the different physiological responses in the two ADHD subtypes.","output":"Exploring autonomic regulation in children with ADHD with and without comorbid anxiety disorder through three systematic levels of cardiac vagal control analysis: Rest, reactivity, and recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Internet is often the first resource used by applicants to evaluate fellowship programs. However, information on these websites can be often incomplete, inaccessible, and/or inaccurate. The primary objective of this study was to examine key factors that orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship applicants use to rank programs. The secondary objective was to assess both the accessibility and availability of the information on orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship program websites. METHODS: A Qualtrics survey was distributed via e-mail to those who matched into an orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship position from years 2008-2020. A comprehensive list of orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship programs was created. Program websites were evaluated for accessibility as well as the quality of recruitment and educational content. RESULTS: There were a total of 114 survey responses out of 644 invites (17.7%). The most important factors for establishing a rank list were operative experience, current faculty, and program reputation. Eighty-five percent (41/48) of orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship websites were directly accessible using Google. On average, accessible orthopedic foot and ankle fellowship websites contained only 57% (11.5/20) of the content deemed desirable. CONCLUSION: Orthopedic foot and ankle websites are widely accessible and have higher recruitment and educational quality content scores compared with previously published data. The most important factors for establishing a rank list are consistent with previous literature. Those who ranked operative experience as one of the most important factors when establishing a rank list did not complete more operative cases than those who did not.

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 disease and are at higher risk for preterm birth compared to uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 among pregnant and non-pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and non-pregnant (n=17) women who had either tested positive (pregnant n=22; non-pregnant n=17) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (pregnant n=11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine mRNAs, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. Additionally, we evaluated anti-spike (S) IgG, anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma collected from non-pregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women expressed more IL1?, but not IL6, in blood samples collected within 14 days versus > 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test. Pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection also had reduced anti-S-RBD IgG titers and were less likely to have detectable nAb as compared with non-pregnant women. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection did not disrupt FcRn expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of SARS-CoV-2 nAb was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of COVID-19 therapeutics in pregnancy. The long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health also requires greater consideration.","output":"Pregnancy alters IL-1? expression and anti-viral antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) make it technically possible for digital assets to be owned and traded, introducing the concept of scarcity in the digital realm for the first time. Resulting from this technical development, this paper asks the question, do they provide an opportunity for fundraising for galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM), by selling ownership of digital copies of their collections? Although NFTs in their current format were first invented in 2017 as a means for game players to trade virtual goods, they reached the mainstream in 2021, when the auction house Christies held their first-ever sale exclusively for an NFT of a digital image, that was eventually sold for a record 69 million USD. The potential of NFTs to generate significant revenue for artists and museums by selling effectively a cryptographically signed copy of a digital image (similar to real-world limited editions, which are signed and numbered copies of a given artwork), has sparked the interest of the financially deprived museum and heritage sector with world-renowned institutions such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Hermitage Museum, having already employed NFTs in order to raise funds. Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of blockchain technology and the rise of malicious projects, exploiting previously digitised heritage content made available through OpenGLAM licensing, have attracted criticism over the speculative use of the technology. In this paper, we present the current state of affairs in relation to NFTs and the cultural heritage sector, identifying challenges, whilst highlighting opportunities that they create for revenue generation, in order to help address the ever-increasing financial challenges of galleries and museums.","output":"Crypto Collectibles, Museum Funding and OpenGLAM: Challenges, Opportunities and the Potential of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructor playing an advising and facilitating role. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babe? Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design.

It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised.

Concurrent circulation of both classic and variant IBVs have been identified in most parts of the world, raising major challenges to global prevention and control efforts. Therefore, immunopathogenesis, particularly early host responses, needs to be better understood for effective control of diseases caused by different strains of IBVs. We investigated differing immunopathogenesis in chickens following infection with IS/885/00-like (885), QX-like (QX) and M41 IBV strains. We confirmed that the histopathological changes, proinflammatory and innate immune gene responses were induced to different magnitudes, depending on the IBV strain. Results indicated that upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-1) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF) expression is induced by IBV M41 in the trachea and by IBV 885 and QX in the kidney, which mainly coincides with tracheal and renal histopathological lesions respectively caused by these strains. In addition, elevated levels of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN- expression occurred concurrently with greater lesion severity in IBV infected trachea and kidney tissues.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In our current study, we found that two types of deficient ACE2 isoforms from different mammals compete with full-length ACE2 for association with S protein. One type of ACE2 is a natural soluble isoform, the other type of ACE2 only associates with one loop of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Mammals with either type of ACE2 will be deficient in support of SARS-CoV-2 entry. By combining S recognition and isoform analysis of ACE2, we predict that felids, mustelids, hamsters, and sheep are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while canids, swines, cattle, and goats are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the differential susceptibilities of mammals with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be partially explained by the ACE2 isoform diversity.

In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.

The fast spread of COVID-19 increased the diagnostic encumbrance of radiologists. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is an effective tool to detect COVID-19 but requires a radiology expert and takes a large time. The machine learning (ML) based models are considered as one of the important ways to analyze the CT images to detect the COVID-19 cases. Therefore, this paper has been focused on finding a suitable machine learning algorithm that can automatically analyze CT images to extract and detect COVID-19 pneumonia features with higher accuracy. This research used classifiers as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree (DT) to classify CT images into COVID-19 and NonCOVID-19. This paper also designed an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based model to achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19. The CT exams of other lung diseases were included in the dataset to improve the model performance. So, the NonCOVID-19 results of the proposed models include the other lung diseases. Confusion matrices and ROC analyses of the proposed models are analyzed using 5-fold cross-validation. During the study and testing of several proposed models, the experimental results showed that the performance of the ANFIS proposed model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 98.63% and 0.02 s testing time.

Sequence analyses revealed that this virus is related to hypoviruses, in particular to Wuhan insect virus 14, an unclassified hypovirus identified from insect meta-transcriptomics, as well as other hypoviruses belonging to the genus Hypovirus, and therefore this virus is designed as Alternaria alternata hypovirus 1 (AaHV1). The genome of AaHV1 contains a single large open-reading frame encoding a putative polyprotein (479 kDa) with a cysteine proteinase-like and replication-associated domains. Curing AaHV1 from the fungal host strain indicated that the virus is responsible for the slow growth and reduced virulence of the host. AaHV1 defective RNA (D-RNA) with internal deletions emerging during fungal subcultures but the presence of D-RNA does not affect AaHV1 accumulation and pathogenicities.

While public health guidelines advised continued provision of timely care for patients, disruption of safety-net health care and public fear have been proposed to be related to indirect deaths because of delays in presentation. We hypothesized that admissions for emergency general surgery (EGS) diagnoses would decrease during the pandemic and that mortality for these patients would increase. METHODS: A multicenter observational study comparing EGS admissions from January to May 2020 to 2018 and 2019 across 11 NYC hospitals in the largest public health care system in the United States was performed. Emergency general surgery diagnoses were defined using International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and grouped into seven common diagnosis categories: appendicitis, cholecystitis, small/large bowel, peptic ulcer disease, groin hernia, ventral hernia, and necrotizing soft tissue infection. Baseline demographics were compared including age, race/ethnicity, and payor status. Outcomes included coronavirus disease (COVID) status and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,376 patients were admitted for EGS diagnoses from January to May 2020, a decrease compared with both 2018 (1,789) and 2019 (1,668) (p < 0.0001). This drop was most notable after the stay-at-home mandate (March 22, 2020; week 12). From March to May 2020, 3.3%, 19.2%, and 6.0% of EGS admissions were incidentally COVID positive, respectively. Mortality increased in March to May 2020 compared with 2019 (2.2% vs. 0.7%); this difference was statistically significant between April 2020 and April 2019 (4.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Supporting our hypothesis, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home mandate resulted in decreased EGS admissions between March and May 2020 compared with prior years. During this time, there was also a statistically significant increase in mortality, which peaked at the height of COVID infection rates in our population.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 because of their profession. There are limited studies conducted in Ethiopia among HCWs regarding their compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, this study intended to assess HCWs compliance with measures to prevent COVID-19, and its potential determinants in public hospitals in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered, multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional survey was proposed to 422 randomly selected HCWs working in seven public hospitals in Western Ethiopia identified as COVID-19 referral centers. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential determinants of outcome variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 422 completed questionnaires, the overall HCWs compliance with COVID-19 prevention is 22% (n = 404). In multivariate regression analysis, factors such as spending most of caring time at bedside (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.06C3.55), receiving training on infection prevention/COVID-19 (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.04C3.33), reading materials on COVID-19 (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI, 1.14C3.63) and having support from hospital management (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI, 1.20C3.64) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, inadequate supplies of appropriate personal protective equipment (83.2%), insufficient supportive medications (78.5%), and lack of provision of adequate ventilation (77.7%) were the barriers to COVID-19 prevention most frequently mentioned by participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight HCWs poor compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Providing information and refreshing training to improve the level of healthcare workers adherence with COVID-19 prevention is as imperative as increasing staff commitment to supply resources necessary to protect HCWs and to reduce healthcare-associated infections transmission of SARS-COV-2.

Microgrooves were fabricated with a truncated V-shape in cross-section at 15/3.5, 30/10, and 60/10 m (width/depth) by photolithography. Subsequent acid etching was applied to the entire surface of the fabricated Ti substratum to generate etched microgrooves and ridges (designated as E15/3.5, E30/10, and E60/10). Both smooth and acidetched-only Ti were used as controls (designated as NE0 and E0). Large-scale gene expression analyses were performed using differential display PCR, and the results were confirmed using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Of the 21 genes with altered expression determined by differential display PCR and sequencing, we verified through RT-PCR that MTDH and TIMP1 were up-regulated and TGF-1, TPM1, and VIM were down-regulated in the HGFs cultured on E60/10 versus NE0. We also confirmed, by quantitative real-time PCR, that MTDH and TIMP1 expression in HGFs on E60/10 was significantly up-regulated compared to HGFs on the other Ti substrata.

The results revealed that QX-like IBV strain SD was severely pathogenic in chickens, causing respiratory, urinary and reproductive infections, irrespective of age, based on clinical observations, viral distribution in tissues and a ciliostasis study. Severe respiratory signs, tracheal cilia injury, nephritis and abnormal development of the oviduct and ovarian follicles were evident throughout the experiment. A challenge experiment demonstrated that the homologous QX vaccine showed superior protection efficacy compared with other available vaccines, confirming the importance of IBV vaccine seed homology against the circulating IBV strains.

Further functional assays showed that the N terminus of SARS-CoVs Nsp1 alone loses the ability to colocalize with ribosomes and inhibit protein translation. The C terminus of Nsp1 can colocalize with ribosomes, but its protein translation inhibition ability is significantly weakened. Interestingly, fusing the C terminus of Nsp1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or other proteins in place of its N terminus restored the protein translation inhibitory ability to a level equivalent to that of full-length Nsp1. Thus, our results suggest that the N terminus of Nsp1 is able to stabilize the binding of the Nsp1 C terminus to ribosomes and act as a nonspecific barrier to block the mRNA channel, thus abrogating host mRNA translation.","output":"Structural Basis and Function of the N Terminus of SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the trends in violent penetrating injuries during the first COVID-19 pandemic year compared with previous years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to compare the prevalence of violent penetrating injuries during the first COVID-19 pandemic year, March 2020 to February 2021, with the previous 5 years, March 2015 to February 2020. This study was performed among all patients with a violent penetrating injury presenting at Boston Medical Center, an urban, level I trauma center that is the largest safety-net hospital and busiest trauma center in New England. Data were analyzed from January 4 to November 29, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the incidence and timing of emergency department presentation for violent penetrating injuries during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 5 years. Patient demographics and injury characteristics were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2383 patients (median [IQR] age, 29.5 [23.4-39.3] years; 2032 [85.4%] men and 351 [14.6%] women) presenting for a violent penetrating injury were evaluated, including 1567 Black patients (65.7%), 448 Hispanic patients (18.8%), and 210 White patients (8.8%). There was an increase in injuries during the first pandemic year compared with the previous 5 years, with an increase in shootings (mean [SD], 0.61 [0.89] injuries per day vs 0.46 [0.76] injuries per day; P = .002) but not stabbings (mean [SD], 0.60 [0.79] injuries per day vs 0.60 [0.82] injuries per day; P = .78). This surge in firearm violence began while Massachusetts was still under a stay-at-home advisory and before large-scale racial justice protests began. Patients presenting with violent penetrating injuries in the pandemic surge months (April-October 2020) compared with the same period in previous years were disproportionately male (153 patients [93.3%] vs 510 patients [87.6%]; P = .04), unemployed (70 patients [57.4%] vs 221 patients [46.6%]; P = .03), and Hispanic (40 patients [26.0%] vs 99 patients [17.9%]; P = .009), with a concurrent decrease in White patients (0 patients vs 26 patients [4.7%]), and were more likely to have no previous history of violent penetrating injury (146 patients [89.0%] vs 471 patients [80.9%]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that unprecedented measures implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 were associated with an increase in gun violence.

The ability of influenza vaccines to elicit CD4(+) T cells and the relationship between induction of CD4(+) T cells and vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses has been controversial. The emergence of swine-origin 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) provided a unique opportunity to examine responses to an influenza vaccine composed of both novel and previously encountered antigens and to probe the relationship between B-cell and T-cell responses to vaccination. Methods. We tracked CD4(+) T-cell and antibody responses of human subjects vaccinated with monovalent subunit A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. The specificity and magnitude of the CD4(+) T-cell response was evaluated using cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays in conjugation with peptide pools representing distinct influenza virus proteins. Results. Our studies revealed that vaccination induced readily detectable CD4(+) T cells specific for conserved portions of hemagglutinin (HA) and the internal viral proteins. Interestingly, expansion of HA-specific CD4(+) T cells was most tightly correlated with the antibody response. Conclusions. These results indicate that CD4(+) T-cell expansion may be a limiting factor in development of neutralizing antibody responses to pandemic influenza vaccines and suggest that approaches to facilitate CD4(+) T-cell recruitment may increase the neutralizing antibody produced in response to vaccines against novel influenza strains.","output":"CD4(+) T-Cell Expansion Predicts Neutralizing Antibody Responses to Monovalent, Inactivated 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Subtype H1N1 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the education sectors at all levels globally.

Methods: Antibody testing was performed on three clinical cohorts of COVID-19 disease: hospitalised patients with PCR confirmation, hospitalized patients with a clinical diagnosis but negative PCR, and symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs). Pre-pandemic respiratory infection sera were tested as negative controls. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated at different time points (<5 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, >20 days, >42 days), and compared between cohorts. Results: Performance of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 assay varied significantly between cohorts. For PCR confirmed hospitalised patients (n = 114), early sensitivity was low: <5 days: 44.4% (95%CI: 18.9%-73.3%), 5-9 days: 32.6% (95%CI, 20.5%-47.5%), 10-14 days: 65.2% (95% CI 44.9%-81.2%), 15-20 days: 66.7% (95% CI: 39.1%-86.2%) but by day 20, sensitivity was 100% (95%CI, 86.2-100%).

In order to control COVID-19, studies on viral structure and mechanism of infectivity and pathogenicity are sorely needed. The spike (S) protein is comprised of S1 & S2 subunits. These spike protein subunits enable viral attachment by binding to the host cell via ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) receptor, thus facilitating the infection. During viral entry, one of the key steps is the cleavage of the S1-S2 spike protein subunits via surface TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) and results in viral infection. Hence, the S-protein is critical for the viral attachment and penetration into the host. The rapid advancement of our knowledge on the structural and functional aspects of the spike protein could lead to development of numerous candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Here the authors discuss about the structure of spike protein and explore its related functions. Our aim is to provide a better understanding that may aid in fighting against CoVID-19 and its treatment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein: Site-Specific Breakpoints for the Development of COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Malaysian government's ongoing movement control order (MCO) to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, has disrupted the teaching and learning (T&L) activities of higher education institutions in the country This paper seeks to outline the steps taken by the Department of Family Medicine of the International Medical University (IMU), Malaysia, to adapt its online teaching and learning activities The five tips are: i) understand how to use online T&L platforms;ii) teachers should create multiple communication channels;iii) ensure attendance is captured;iv) enhance the online T&L experience and v) conduct online formative assessments","output":"Five Tips for Teaching and Learning During the COVID-19 Movement Control Order Era: A Family Medicine Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actualizing the vision of Global Digital Health is a central issue on the Global Health Diplomacy agenda.

Information on the incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients, however, remains unclear. Method: English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane), Chinese-language databases (CNKI, VIP, WANFANG), and preprint platforms were searched to identify studies with data of VTE occurrence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pooled incidence and relative risks (RRs) of VTE were estimated by a random-effects model. Variations were examined based on clinical manifestations of VTE (pulmonary embolism-PE and deep vein thrombosis-DVT), disease severity (severe patients and non-severe patients), and rate of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (60 and <60%). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to strengthen the robustness of results. Meta-regression was performed to explore the risk factors associated with VTE in COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 1,913 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of VTE was 25% (95% CI, 19C31%; I(2), 95.7%), with a significant difference between the incidence of PE (19%; 95% CI, 13C25%; I(2), 93.2%) and DVT (7%; 95% CI, 4C10%; I(2), 88.3%; P(interaction) < 0.001). Higher incidence was observed in severe COVID-19 patients (35%; 95 CI%, 25C44%; I(2), 92.4%) than that in non-severe patients (6%; 95 CI%, 3C10%; I(2), 62.2%; P(interaction) < 0.001). The high rate of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients (60%) was associated with a lower incidence of VTE compared with the low pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis rate (<60%) (19 vs. 40%; P(interaction) = 0.052). Severe patients had a 3.76-fold increased risk of VTE compared with non-severe patients (RR, 4.76; 95% CI, 2.66C8.50; I(2), 47.0%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the primacy results. Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that the estimated VTE incidence was 25% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Higher incidence of VTE was observed in COVID-19 patients with a severe condition or with a low rate of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Assessment of VTE risk is strongly recommended in COVID-19 patients, and effective measures of thromboprophylaxis should be taken in a timely manner for patients with high risk of VTE.","output":"Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Privacy issues limit the analysis and cross-exploration of most distributed and private biobanks, often raised by the multiple dimensionality and sensitivity of the data associated with access restrictions and policies.

This virus has caused a global pandemic involving more than 200 countries. SARS-CoV-2 is highly adapted to humans and readily transmits from person-to-person. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 under various environmental factors, disinfectants and different pH conditions. The efficacy of a variety of laboratory virus inactivation methods and home disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. METHODS: The residual virus in dried form or in solution was titrated on Vero E6 cell line at day 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after incubation at different temperatures. The viability of virus was determined after treatment with different disinfectants and pH solutions at room temperature (2025(o)C). FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 was able to retain viability for 3-5 days in dried form or 7 days in solution at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected under a wide range of pH conditions from pH4 to pH11 for several days and 1 to 2 days in stool at room temperature but lost 5 logs of infectivity. A variety of commonly used disinfectants and laboratory inactivation procedures were found to reduce viral viability effectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and raises the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. Commonly used fixatives, nucleic acid extraction methods and heat inactivation were found to significantly reduce viral infectivity that could ensure hospital and laboratory safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Factors affecting stability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) established a consolidated COVID-19 screening area (CSA) beginning in March 2020 to provide beneficiary and staff testing via a drive-through site. Testing was available to all patients and WRNMMC staff regardless of beneficiary status. Presented is a descriptive analysis of our testing operations and positivity rates within a closed medical system from March 2020 to April 2021. METHODS: For quality and process improvement, we compiled daily testing logs from March 2020 to April 2021 from the CSA. These logs included patient demographics, reason for testing, test result, testing platform, and occupational status at the hospital. We determined positivity rates in various subgroups C asymptomatic, symptomatic, pre-operative, in order to track testing use and access. Additionally, we compared the overall positivity rate to the surrounding civilian community by pulling data from the Maryland Department of Healths COVID database. RESULTS: Over the course of nearly 14 months of testing availability, 34,694 beneficiaries were screened with 41,582 individual tests. After May 2020, the monthly overall positivity rate varied from 1.99% to 11.92%, peaking in December 2020 (with high rates in November 2020, 7.52% and January 2021, 9.53%), correlating with or exceeding elevated positivity rates in Montgomery County (November 2020: 4.91%; December 2020: 6.48%; January 2021: 6.51%). When examining only symptomatic individuals, the positivity rate is notably much higher, with monthly rates varying from 6.40% to 21.10%, with a similar peak in December 2020. After full implementation of pre-operative screening for procedures with aerosolization potential in June 2020, the range of positivity rates was 0.28%-1.66%. Since vaccination for COVID-19 became widely available beginning in Feb 2021, the preoperative positivity rate has remained below 0.85%. CONCLUSION: Our institutional experience is unique in its ability to offer universal access to COVID-19 testing for beneficiaries and staff of the DoD under direction of the ID service. Our process serves as a model for public and occupational health response, and may guide lab resource and real-time staffing management in support of COVID-19 diagnostics at a medical center.

However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic arms races with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in housekeeping functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a >300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.","output":"Rapid Evolution of PARP Genes Suggests a Broad Role for ADP-Ribosylation in Host-Virus Conflicts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of traditional medicinal plants in Saudi Arabia stems mainly from consumers belief in prophetic medicine This study was conducted to explore changes in patients use of dietary or herbal supplements among individuals infected with COVID-19 before and during infection and the association between herbal or dietary supplements and hospitalization A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted enrolling symptomatic patients who had recently recovered from COVID-19 Data were collected through phone interviews, and McNemars test was used to investigate changes to consumption of dietary or herbal supplements before and during infection Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between supplements use during patients infection and hospitalization A total of 738 patients were included in this study, of whom 32 1% required hospitalization About 57% of participants were male with a mean age of 36 5 (11 9) years The use of lemon/orange, honey, ginger, vitamin C, and black seed among participants significantly increased during their infection In contrast, patients using anise, peppermint, and coffee peel before their infection were more likely to stop using them during their infection In addition, using lemon/orange (p &lt;0 0001), honey (p = 0 0002), ginger (p = 0 0053), vitamin C (p = 0 0006), black seed (p &lt;0 0001), peppermint (p = 0 0027), costus (p = 0 0095), and turmeric (p = 0 0012) was significantly higher among nonhospitalized patients than hospitalized ones However, in the multivariable logistic regression, only use of vitamin C (OR = 0 51;95% CI 0 33C0 79), peppermint (OR = 0 53;95% CI 0 31C0 90), and lemon/orange (OR = 0 54;95% CI 0 33C0 88) was associated with significantly lower odds of hospitalization The study reveals that patients consumption of dietary or herbal supplements changed in response to their COVID-19 infection, with hospitalized patients having a lower likelihood of using these supplements Because some supplements were associated with lower odds of hospitalization, these supplements or their bioactive components should be further investigated as feasible options for COVID-19 treatment","output":"Patients Behavior Regarding Dietary or Herbal Supplements before and during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has created a great deal of fear and uncertainty about health, economy, and social life.

By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just 8% over the same periods and the distribution of session start and end times remained consistent throughout the year. While EV mobility dropped more dramatically than total vehicle mobility during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, and returned more slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean values by September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Mobility and Electric Vehicle Charging Load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to discuss the dynamics of public policies in the scope of gender and race in Brazil, taking the covid-19 pandemic as a scenario Considering the vulnerability of the black in relation to the observation of the rules of social isolation, the article asks about the scope of the public policies adopted to protect this population Considering an urban spatial geography based on lethality projects, there is an investment in the protection of the white city, in the terms proposed by Frantz Fanon, despite the need to protect blacks Thus, the black city is understood as a woman-city, in which the debauchery of the state's terror can be perpetrated without question At the opposite pole of these territories, there are private properties linked to real estate speculation protected by the pacts of the elites These properties could serve as a shelter for thousands of people in need in the context of the pandemic The genocide of blacks, therefore, is also taking shape in the concreteness of urban racial segregation in the face of the pandemic Regarding the methodology, the article is based on the notion of feminism proposed by Llia Gonzalez, consolidating a narrative that accesses the object of investigation through the necessary overlap of gender, race, class and sexuality ? 2020 Centro Universitario de Brasilia All rights reserved","output":"Death policies: Covid-19 and the labyrinths of the black city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations are the driving force of evolution and the source of important pathologies. The characterization of the dynamics and effects of mutations on fitness is therefore central to our understanding of evolution and to human health. This protocol describes how to implement two methods that we recently developed: mutation visualization (MV) and microfluidic mutation accumulation (MA), which allow the occurrence of mutations created by DNA replication errors (MV) and the evolution of cell fitness during MA (MA) to be followed directly in individual cells of Escherichia coli. MV provides a quantitative characterization of the dynamics of mutation occurrences, and MA allows precise estimation of the distribution of fitness effects (DFEs) of mutations. Both methods use microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, and a fluorescent mismatch repair (MMR) MutL protein is used as a marker for nascent mutations. Here, we present a single protocol describing how to implement the MV and MA methods, including detailed procedures for microfluidic setup installation, data acquisition and data analysis and interpretation. Using this procedure, the microfluidic setup installation can be completed within 1 d, and automated data acquisition takes 2-4 d.","output":"Real-time visualization of mutations and their fitness effects in single bacteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The current pandemic of novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a significant shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in many countries of the world, stressing medical services during this crisis. Along with addressing problems of demand and supply mismatch, there also need to ensure procurement of high quality PPEs that provide both safety and comfort to users. The purpose of this article is to review existing standards and recommendations on the technical aspects of PPE. Areas covered: For this review, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Research Gate were searched. Studies reporting technical aspects of component of PPE including mask and respirator, gown and coverall, gloves, goggles, face shields or visors, and boots, are included in this review. Expert commentary: The design and materials of PPE needs further research, which might have minimal carriage of infective biological load like use of antimicrobial repellent finishes along with adequate tensile strength and breathability through the fabric. Respirators should have least resistance while providing maximum protection; goggles should not have fogging. Also, there is need of formulating universal technical specifications for medically used PPE, and ensuring easy availability of testing facility.","output":"Personal Protective Equipment during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review on Technical Aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine impact of pre-existing and incident problematic musculoskeletal (MSK) areas after total knee replacement (TKR) on postoperative 60-month Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain/function scores. METHODS Using data from a randomized controlled trial of subjects undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis, we assessed problematic MSK areas in six body regions before TKR and 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after TKR. We defined the following two variables: 1) density count (number of problematic MSK areas occurring after TKR; range 0-24) and 2) cumulative density count (problematic MSK areas both before and after TKR, categorized into four levels: no preoperative areas and density count of 0-1 [reference group]; no preoperative areas and density count of 2 or more; one or more preoperative areas and density count of 0-1; and one or more preoperative areas and density count of 2 or greater). We evaluated the associations between categorized 60-month WOMAC and cumulative density count by ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS Among 230 subjects, 24% reported one or more preoperative problematic MSK area. After TKR, 75% reported a density count of 0 to 1; 25% reported a density count of 2 or more. Compared with the reference group, each cumulative density count category was associated with an increased odds of having a higher category of 60-month WOMAC pain score, as follows: 2.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-5.98) for no preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater, 3.31 (95% CI, 1.64-6.66) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 0 to 1, and 2.85 (95% CI, 0.97-8.39) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater.

Finally the authors review the Slintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Slintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.","output":"Slintecare implementation status in 2020: Limited progress with entitlement expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.","output":"T-cell receptor sequencing identifies prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates with neutralizing antibody titers and disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meaningful activities in dementia care can promote the co-construction of narrative identity in caregiving relationships, helping to preserve the sense of self in people with dementia. Purpose: Informed by symbolic interactionism and Deweyan transactionalism, the aim of this study was to develop a transactional model of how narrative identity and relationships are promoted through the use of a new technological solution, SENSE-GARDEN, that uses digital technologies and multisensory stimuli to facilitate individualized, meaningful activities. Method: We conducted a qualitative interview study to explore the experiences of people with moderate to advanced dementia and their caregivers in Norway and Portugal. After using SENSE-GARDEN for 12C16 weeks, 20 participants (7 persons with dementia and 13 caregivers) were interviewed. The interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated: openness, learning, and connection. Findings suggest that SENSE-GARDEN can stimulate emotional experiences, preserve narrative identity, and foster interpersonal relationships. These findings are illustrated through a transactional model. Conclusion: This study highlights the complex multitude of factors affecting person-environment interactions in which narrative identity and relationships are constructed.

Introduction The Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) or stubble disease is one of the most frequent endemic zoonoses. Restricted to the farming areas of the Central West region of Argentina, it is produced by the Junn virus and it is transmitted by a rodent, the corn-mouse (Calomys musculinus). Objectives To recognize the neurological signs and symptoms of AHF that appear in the first 24-48hours of the onset of the disease. To describe the sequence of neurological manifestations in its common and severe clinical forms. Also, of the sequelae and late neurological complications Content Early diagnosis and timely intervention define the clinical evolution and prognosis. Attention must be paid to previously healthy adult patients undergoing acute nonspecific febrile syndrome of an unknown cause for less than a week of evolution. Differential diagnosis should be made with other endemic infectious diseases, and the emerging infectious disease COVID 19, appraising epidemiological surveillance. Conclusions Clinical examination, laboratory tests, serological diagnosis and images allow the early diagnosis. In Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, immune plasma therapy within the 5 days of the onset of the disease prevents progression towards severe clinical forms with high mortality rates. The fatality rate for FHA without treatment is 30%.

The data were collected in a Eurobarometer survey, and refer to resource efficiency, green markets, and CE procedures. Lack of environmental expertise is one of the factors that might be perceived as an obstacle when trying to implement resource-efficiency actions. Previous research has shown that, although resource-efficiency practices are adopted by firms in all European countries, there are differences both within and between countries. The analysis of the determinants of green behavior by European SMEs was completed by a study of heterogeneity across firms and within countries with a multilevel latent class model, a hierarchical clustering method. A general important observation is that having no workers dedicated to green jobs is strongly correlated to the probability of adopting resource-efficiency practices, while perceiving the need of extra environmental skills has a positive effect on the intention to implement actions in the future. Other characteristics of the firms play a significant impact on resource efficiency: in general, older and bigger firms, with larger yearly turnover, are more prone to implement actions.","output":"Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy in European SMEs: Investigating the Role of Green Jobs and Skills"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decreased engagement in preventive services, including vaccination, during the COVID-19 pandemic represents a grave threat to global health.

However, these studies have been mostly performed in patients admitted to hospital and hence likely already (severely) affected. Another suggested approach employs prophylactic (H)CQ treatment aimed at preventing either SARS-CoV-2 infection or development of disease. A substantial number of clinical trials are planned or underway aimed at assessing the prophylactic benefit of (H)CQ. However, (H)CQ may lead to QT-prolongation and potentially induce life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be of particular relevance for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. In addition, it is known that a certain percentage of the population carries genetic variant(s) which reduces their repolarization reserve, predisposing them to (H)CQ-induced QT-prolongation, and this may be more relevant in females who already have a longer QT to start with. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on (H)CQ therapy in COVID-19 patients and discusses different strategies for prophylactic (H)CQ therapy (i.e. pre-infection, post-exposure, post-infection). In particular, the potential cardiac effects, including QT-prolongation and arrhythmias will be addressed. Based on these insights, recommendations will be presented as to which preventive measures should be taken when giving (H)CQ prophylactically, including ECG monitoring.","output":"Prophylactic (hydroxy)chloroquine in COVID-19: potential relevance for cardiac arrhythmia risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 and associated measures to control the spread of the COVID-19 has significantly impacted clinical research. This study aimed to determine the impact COVID-19 has had on psychiatric clinical trials and to assess whether certain trial areas or trial types were differentially affected. METHODS: We used information from ClinicalTrials.gov, the largest online database of clinical trial information, to examine changes in psychiatric clinical trials from January 2010CDecember 2020. RESULTS: Clinical trial initiation decreased in 2020, with a year-on-year percent change in trial initiation of ?5.4% versus an expected percent change based on forecasting observed trends from 2010-2019 of 8.6%. When broken down by disease area, the distribution of trials observed in 2020 was significantly different from the predicted distribution (p < 0.00001). The greatest decrease in trial initiation was seen in Schizophrenia-specific trials, with an observed percent change of ?29.2% versus an expected percent change of 3.2%. Conversely, anxiety trials saw a significant increase in trial initiation during 2020, with an observed percent change of 24.6% versus an expected percent change of 16.0%. When assessing interventional versus observational studies, data showed a significant increase in initiation of observational psychiatric clinical trials (p < 0.05), and a significant decrease in initiation of interventional psychiatric clinical trials (p < 0.01). When data was analyzed on a month-by-month time scale, 7/12 months in 2020 showed significant decreases when compared to initiation during matching months over prior years, and a single month, June, showed a significant increase.

The efficacy of this drug is controversial and could significantly influence the efficiency in healthcare systems. The objective is the methodological interpretation of subgroup analyzes according to starting of remdesivir treatment with respect to symptom onset of COVID-19. METHODS: A search in Pubmed? database was performed. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with subgroup analysis regarding early and late use of remdesivir were selected. All endpoints were assessed using two methodologies. First methodology considered statistical interaction, pre-specification, biological plausibility, and consistency of results. Second methodology was a validated tool with preliminary questions to discard subset analysis without relevant minimum conditions, and a checklist with recommendations for applicability. RESULTS: A total of 54 results were found and five RCTs were selected. According first methodology, consistent heterogeneity was only found in time to clinical improvement and better clinical status score at day 15 for patients with severe COVID-19 and <7 days of symptoms. About second methodology, these results about early use of remdesivir may be applied to clinical practice with caution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a systematic search and application of an established methodology for interpretation of subgroup analysis about early use of remdesivir.

The introduction of over-the-counter hearing aids is set to disrupt the predominantly high-cost, specialty clinic-based delivery model of hearing care with the hope of increasing accessibility and affordability of hearing care. However, the current model of hearing care delivery may not be reaching everyone with hearing loss who have yet to use hearing aids. In this study, we examine the group of people who do not use hearing aids and describe their characteristics and health care utilization patterns. We also consider what other healthcare pathways may be utilized to increase access to hearing treatment. Design: Cross-sectional, the 2017 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Setting: Non-institutionalized adults enrolled in Medicare, the U.S. public health insurance program for older adults (65 years and older) and those with qualifying medical conditions and disabilities. Participants: A nationally representative sample of 7,361 Medicare beneficiaries with self-reported trouble hearing and/or hearing aid use. Measurements: Survey-weighted proportions described the population characteristics and health care utilization of those with hearing loss by hearing aid use, and the characteristics of those with untreated hearing loss by health care service type utilized. Results: Women, racial/ethnic minorities, and low-income Medicare beneficiaries with self-reported hearing trouble were less likely to report using hearing aids than their peers. Among those who do not use hearing aids, the most commonly used health care services were obtaining prescription drugs (64%) and seeing a medical provider (50%). Only 20% did not access either service in the past year. These individuals were more likely to be young and to have higher educational attainment and income. Conclusion: Alternative models of care delivered through pharmacies and general medical practices may facilitate access to currently underserved populations as they are particularly high touch-points for Medicare beneficiaries with untreated hearing trouble.

However, the wild animal protein consumption of ~ 43% of all consumers in our sample was below the annual minimum per capita rate required to prevent human malnutrition.

We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, that takes into account the presence of aymptomatic carriers, and explore the effects of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number ($R_0>1$) to a target value ($R_0^{\\\\rm target}<1 $), but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target value, $R_0^{\\\\rm target}<1 $, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/per day to the number of new cases/per day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts that an infectious person has, which would be high in regions with high population density and low levels of social distancing. We point out that, apart from $R_0$, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression both pre- and post- intervention and explains observed data. Weak extended intervention strategies (that reduce $R_0$ but not to a value less than $1$) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic.

There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown (Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.","output":"Intermittent yet coordinated regional strategies can alleviate the COVID-19 epidemic: a network model of the Italian case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine if the use of a 5-mm umbilical incision and laparoscope would result in a higher likelihood of earlier discharge from hospital after total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) compared with a 10-mm umbilical incision and laparoscope.

DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING A tertiary care setting. PATIENTS Seventy-eight patients scheduled for TLH were prospectively recruited. INTERVENTIONS Women undergoing TLH were assigned to either a 5-mm umbilical port and laparoscope (5LH) or a 10-mm umbilical port and laparoscope (10LH). All patients underwent a standardized operative technique and anesthetic protocol. Patients and research assistants responsible for postoperative pain assessment were blinded to group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome measure was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures were operating time, pain scores on postoperative days 1 and 7, and complication rates. There was no difference in length of hospital stay between the 2 arms. Compared with the 10LH group, the 5LH group had shorter operative times (32.6 vs 40 minutes; p = .01) and less postoperative pain on day 1 (2.5 vs 3.3; p = .03 for \\"pain with movement\\") and on day 7 (.92 vs 1.8; p = .002).

We aimed to determine risk factors associated with readmission in patients who underwent same-day discharge SG. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database for the period 2015C2018. Patients who underwent SG and were discharged the same day of the operation were included in the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for readmission. RESULTS: A total of 466,270 SG were performed during the study period; 14,624 (3.1%) patients were discharged the same day and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 43.4 (14.7C80) years and 11,718 (80.1%) were female. Mean preoperative BMI was 43.7  7.4 kg/m(2). Mean operative time was 58.3  32.4 min. Thirty-day reoperation, reintervention, and mortality rates were 0.7%, 0.7%, and 0.1%, respectively. Readmission rates were similar in same-day discharge and inpatient SG (2.9% vs. 3%, p = 0.5). Female sex (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15C2.00), preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08C1.64), renal insufficiency (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.01C9.32), and intraoperative drain placement (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.37C2.31) were independent risk factors for readmission following same-day discharge SG.

While highly sensitive, the specificity of FDG remains suboptimal for differentiating malignant from benign nodules, particularly in areas where fungal lung diseases are prevalent. Thus, a cancer-specific imaging probe is greatly needed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a PET radiotracer (S)-4-(3-[(18)F]-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (FSPG) improves the diagnostic accuracy of IPNs compared to (18)F-FDG PET/CT. METHODS: This study was conducted at a major academic medical center and an affiliated VA medical center. Twenty-six patients with newly discovered IPNs 7-30mm diameter or newly diagnosed lung cancer completed serial PET/CT scans utilizing (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FSPG, without intervening treatment of the lesion. The scans were independently reviewed by two dual-trained diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine physicians. Characteristics evaluated included quantitative SUVmax values of the pulmonary nodules and metastases. RESULTS: A total of 17 out of 26 patients had cancer and 9 had benign lesions. (18)F-FSPG was negative in 6 of 9 benign lesions compared to 7 of 9 with (18)F-FDG. (18)F-FSPG and (18)F-FDG were positive in 14 of 17 and 12 of 17 malignant lesions, respectively.

Emerging evidence indicates that currently available antiresorptive bone therapies have serious age-dependent side effects. However, a resurgence of healthcare interest has occurred in glycyrrhizin (GLY), a natural extract from the licorice roots, as alternative sources of drugs for treating inflammatory bone lytic diseases and prevention of cellular senescence. This study investigated the effects of GLY on inflammatory bone loss as well as expression patterns of senescence-associated secretory phenotype and senescence-protective markers using an experimental calvarium osteolytic model induced in aged (twenty-four-month-old) mice by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles. Our results indicate that local treatment with GLY significantly diminished the size of inflammatory osteolytic lesions in aged mice via the number of CXCR4+OCPs and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP+) osteoclasts. Furthermore, GLY dramatically decreased the amounts of senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers, including pro-inflammatory macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) chemokine, and cathepsins B and K in the bone lesions of aged mice. By contrast, GLY significantly elevated expression patterns of senescence-protective markers, including homeostatic stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) chemokine, and sirtuin-1, and sirtuin-6, in the PMMA particle-induced calvarial lesions of aged mice. Collectively, these data suggest that GLY can be used for the development of novel therapies to control bone loss and tissue aging in senior patients with periprosthetic osteolysis.","output":"Glycyrrhizin mitigates inflammatory bone loss and promotes expression of senescence-protective sirtuins in an aging mouse model of periprosthetic osteolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Prenatal education represents an important part of maternal prenatal care in Western countries. In Romania, prenatal education is of recent interest but there is no official information about prenatal courses and their impact on prenatal care and patients in Romania. Material and methods: A prospective study based on the STROBE statement was designed in order to assess the prenatal education delivered in our unit. The study group included women who gave birth at Bucur Maternity, Saint. John Hospital, Bucharest, Romania and attended the prenatal courses, compared with a control group (women who gave birth in our unit but did not attend the prenatal lecture). Patients perception about the impact of prenatal education was collected by applying a questionnaire. Results: The analysis included 89 women who fulfilled the questionnaire online. In our study, 62 women (69.7%) attended the prenatal education classes and represented the study group while 27 women (30.3%) constituted the control group. Women who attended the prenatal lecture recognized the utility of the topic regarding newborn care (90.3%), while women from the control group did not consider it useful (n = 55.6%), 2 = 18.412, p < 0.001. Patients from the study group admitted the importance of the topics (93.5%) from the lectures about breast feeding, while the percentage of these women from the control group is significantly lower (55.6%) 2 = 27.867, p < 0.001.

Case: A 36-year-old female with hypertension, smoking, prior alcohol use, chronic pancreatitis and prior COVID-19 infection was transferred for surgical intervention for median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS). She noted abdominal pain, chest discomfort, dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema which began 5 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Physical exam revealed rales, abdominal distention and pitting edema. 12 lead ECG showed a nonspecific ST abnormality. Troponins were 19,222 ng/L (ref < 17 ng/L). Brain natriuretic peptide level was 4734 pg/mL (ref<100 pg/mL). Testing for active COVID-19 infection was negative. Chest x-ray demonstrated a right pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed apical wall akinesis. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary vasculature. Cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal anterolateral, mid-anterior and midanterolateral walls. Decision-making: Myocarditis should be suspected with elevated cardiac biomarkers, new unexplained heart failure and normal coronary angiography. Despite apical dysfunction, Takutsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy was less likely given CMR findings of LGE. Acute COVID-19 infection is well known to be associated with acute myocarditis but testing was negative. Testing for other potential etiologies (HIV, EBV, toxicology) was also negative. There was no history of collagen-vascular disease. Surgical and gastrointestinal consultations noted symptoms were consistent with acute heart failure rather than MALS. Timing was most consistent with vaccine induced myocarditis given onset within days of second injection with an mRNA vaccine. Based on the above findings decision was made to begin the patient on guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) with diuretics, ace inhibition and beta blockade. Conclusion: While most common in young males, myocarditis following shortly after mRNA vaccine administration should be considered in patients without another etiology and with appropriate timing of symptom development.

Various treatment strategies have been attempted. Methods and Results A 61-year-old male with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and confirmed positive for the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed LVEF 58% (with EF 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously x1 dose. Within 24 hours, he noted significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia which improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. Conclusion Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the changes in urinalysis of COVID-19 patients with normal kidney function. METHODS: The data of COVID-19 patients with normal renal functions were retrospectively analyzed. Urinalysis parameters of these patients were recorded. The patients were divided into three groups as mild, moderate and severe with respect to the clinical course of the disease. It was examined whether the urine analysis values in the groups were different from normal reference values and whether these values were different between the groups. In addition, possible relationship between the urinalysis parameters and the clinical severity of the disease was investigated. RESULTS: There are three groups; mild (n:40), moderate (n:38) and severe (n:42). Mean age were significantly higher in the severe group, while gender distribution of the groups was similar. (p=0.033) (p=0.091) Creatinine values of all patients were normal. There were 6.7% glucose positivity, 13.4% protein positivity, 5.8% urobilinogen positivity and 7.5% ketone positivity in urine dipstick analysis and these changes were all significantly higher than the reference values. (p=0.008, p<0.0001, p=0.016, p=0.016) Pyuria and hematuria were detected in 8.3% and 9.2%, respectively. The urinalysis parameters and urine microscopy findings were not affected by the severity of the disease.

Clinical Case: A 35-year-old was referred to surgery with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic acromegaly. Her GH failed to suppress during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), her IGF-1 and prolactin was high. Her serum calcium was normal and her chromogranin B was high. MRI scan suggested microadenoma. Her surgery was deferred because of Covid 19, and she was treated with somatostatin analog (SSA). She finally had surgery in July. The histology and immunocytochemistry suggested pituitary hyperplasia with diffuse positivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin. GH was positive in the majority of the cells with many cells positive for Prolactin and ACTH. FSH and LH were positive in scattered cells with patchy positivity of TSH. A solitary nodule was noted in her neck during an examination. We arranged to look for conditions associated with pituitary hyperplasia resulting in GHRH production, including the genetic tests for inherited conditions. Her calcitonin level was normal. She had an ultrasound scan guided fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule, this showed Thy3f oncocytic nodule with no features of medullary thyroid carcinoma. She had an NMGa68DOTATATE whole body PET CTand the scan showed a large DOTATAE avid mass from the right adrenal gland compatible with Pheochromocytoma. Her 24 hours total urinary metadrenaline and normetadrenalin was high. Her genetic test for MEN1, CDKN1B, and MEN2 are negative. We have requested the GHRH measurement. After a pituitary surgery, her GH suppressed adequately on OGTT. Her IGF-1 and prolactin is low and her hypogonadism is resolved. Conclusion: Excess production GHRH can result from neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, pancreas, thyroid (medullary thyroid cancer), or pheochromocytomas and hypothalamic gangliocytomas. Several familial syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and 4 (MEN4), familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), Carney complex, and sporadic germline mosaic disorder McCune-Albright disease predispose to pituitary hyperplasia.

In addition, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3C5 exoribonuclease (nsp14), viral proteases, N, and M proteins are important in different stages of viral replication. Accordingly, they are attractive targets for different antiviral therapeutic agents. Although many antiviral agents have been used in different clinical trials and included in different treatment protocols, the mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. Different potential repurposed drugs, including, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, were screened in the present study. Molecular docking of these drugs with different SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including spike and membrane proteins, RdRp, nucleoproteins, viral proteases, and nsp14, was performed. Moreover, the binding affinities of the human ACE-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to the different drugs were evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA calculation were also conducted. Ivermectin and remdesivir were found to be the most promising drugs.

This is a multi-centre, observational, nationwide survey, involving high-volume Italian CHD centres. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as either clinically suspected or confirmed, where a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) test had been performed and was positive. Cardiovascular comorbidities were observed among adult patientsatrial fibrillation (seven; 9%), hypertension (five; 7%), obesity (seven; 9%) and diabetes (one; 1%)but were absent among children. Cardiovascular complications were mainly observed in the confirmed COVID-19(+) group, consisting of heart failure (9%), palpitations/arrhythmias (3%), stroke/TIA (3%) and pulmonary hypertension (3%). Cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain (1%), myocardial injury (1%) and pericardial effusion (1%) were also recorded.

Overview of Literature Due to current global health trends, the number of affected patients is expected to increase substantially. However, no prior systematic reviews have discussed this topic. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in June 2021 in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Clinical and epidemiological studies that reported quantitative data on the prevalence of coexisting LS and KOA were included. Studies which reported data on only LS or KOA alone were excluded. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for LS or KOA were retrieved or calculated for meta-analysis. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used, and statistical significance was considered when p<0.05. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic. Risk of bias was assessed using the MINORs (methodological index for nonrandomized studies) criteria. Results This review included nine studies (5,758 patients). Four studies (4,164 patients) defined KOA and LS by a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of 2 and were included in the meta-analysis. Two other studies defined KOA and LS by a joint space narrowing grade of 2. The remaining three studies reported other outcomes. The combined ORs of having KOA of KL grade 2 due to LS was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.22-2.50; p=0.002), while the combined OR of having LS of KL grade 2 due to KOA was 1.84 (95% CI, 1.23-2.77; p=0.003). Conclusions In patients with either KOA or LS, the odds of having a concurrent knee-spine presentation are significantly increased. This may have implications for clinical decision-making and treatment strategies. Further high-level studies with larger patient populations are required to confirm these results in specific populations.","output":"The Prevalence of Coexisting Lumbar Spondylosis and Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (a??22 nucleotides in length) that negatively regulate protein-coding gene expression post-transcriptionally by targeting mRNAs and triggering either translational repression or RNA degradation. MiRNA genes represent approximately 1% of the genome of different species and it has been estimated that every miRNA can interact with an average of 200 mRNA transcripts, with peaks of 1,500 mRNA targets per miRNA molecule. As a result, miRNAs potentially play a fundamental role in several biological processes including development, metabolism, proliferation, and apoptotic cell death, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Since miRNAs were discovered, Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a model organism to shed light on their functions and their molecular mechanisms in the regulation of many biological and behavioral processes. In this review we focus on the roles of miRNAs in the fruit fly brain, at the level of the visual system that is composed by the compound eyes, each containing a??800 independent unit eyes called ommatidia, and each ommatidium is composed of eight photoreceptor neurons that project into the optic lobes. We describe the roles of a set of miRNAs in the development and in the proper function of the optic lobes (bantam, miR-7, miR-8, miR-210) and of the compound eyes (bantam, miR-7, miR-9a, miR-210, miR-263a/b, miR-279/996), summarizing also the pleiotropic effects that some miRNAs exert on circadian behavior.","output":"The Role of microRNAs in the Drosophila Melanogaster Visual System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most medical images are low in contrast because adequate details that may prove vital decisions are not visible to the naked eye. Also, due to the low-contrast nature of the image, it is not easily segmented because there is no significant change between the pixel values, which makes the gradient very small Hence, the contour cannot converge on the edges of the object. In this work, we have proposed an ensembled spatial method for image enhancement. In this ensembled approach, we first employed the Laplacian filter, which highlights the areas of fast intensity variation. This filter can determine the sufficient details of an image. The Laplacian filter will also improve those features having shrill disjointedness. Then, the gradient of the image has been determined, which utilizes the surrounding pixels for the weighted convolution operation for noise diminishing. However, in the gradient filter, there is one negative integer in the weighting. The intensity value of the middle pixel might be deducted from the surrounding pixels, to enlarge the difference between the head-to-head pixels for calculating the gradients. This is one of the reasons due to which the gradient filter is not entirely optimistic, which may be calculated in eight directions. Therefore, the averaging filter has been utilized, which is an effective filter for image enhancement. This approach does not rely on the values that are completely diverse from distinctive values in the surrounding due to which it recollects the details of the image. The proposed approach significantly showed the best performance on various images collected in dynamic environments.","output":"An Ensembled Spatial Enhancement Method for Image Enhancement in Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic inequality is a collective issue that affects all citizens.

In two studies, one of which pre-registered, Italian participants (Study 1: N = 306; Study 2: N = 384) were led to feel relatively poor or rich, rated their perceived control over either their personal or the nations future and estimated either personal or national economic and general future risks. To measure support for redistribution, participants were invited to allocate their desired level of taxation to each of the five tax brackets included in the Italian personal income tax. Results showed that participants were optimistic about their personal future, but pessimistic about the fate of their nation. This difference was explained by respondents greater perceived control over personal future than over the nations future. Importantly, greater pessimism about national economic risks led to greater support for progressive taxation only for participants who felt relatively poor.","output":"The bright side of pessimism: Promoting wealth redistribution under (felt) economic hardship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (commonly known as SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus (designated as 2019-nCoV), which was isolated for the first time after the Chinese health authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

Antibiotic resistance is an emerging world health problem and unnecessary prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major contributor to this. Skin and soft-tissue infections are a common reason to receive a prescription for antibiotics. Currently there exists a trend for using broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for moderate to severe infections when more narrow-spectrum options would be adequate. This study aimed to characterize the choice of antibiotic being prescribed for the management of outpatient cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics and evaluate the success of a clinical order set outlining optimal therapy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review looking at antibiotic prescribing through the Emergency Department at The Moncton Hospital, in Moncton, New Brunswick. Charts were reviewed before and after the introduction of a clinical order set outlining optimal antibiotic therapy. The goal was to review charts from the pre- and post-intervention group and compare antibiotic usage, treatment failure rates, and adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients receiving IV antibiotics in the pre-intervention group, 3 received cefazolin, 50 received ceftriaxone, while 1 received levofloxacin. The median duration of IV therapy was four days. After the introduction of the clinical order set there was an absolute increase of 53.8% (n = 35) in the use of cefazolin and absolute decrease of 53.7% (n = 23) in the use of ceftriaxone in the post-intervention group of 59 patients. Both results were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The median duration of IV therapy in this group was 3.5 days. In eligible patients, the clinical order set was utilized 61.1% of the time. There was no significant difference in rates of treatment failure or adverse events between cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a clinical order set outlining the preferential use of once-daily cefazolin plus probenecid for the treatment of outpatient cellulitis lead to a statistically significant increase use of cefazolin, and decrease use of ceftriaxone, thus demonstrating a positive stewardship effect at a local level.

Chest X-Ray (CXR) is the first line imaging test for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis as it is fast, cheap and easily accessible. Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision, many DL-models have been proposed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia using CXR images. Unfortunately, these deep classifiers lack the transparency in interpreting findings, which may limit their applications in clinical practice. The existing commonly used visual explanation methods are either too noisy or imprecise, with low resolution, and hence are unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. In this work, we propose a novel explainable deep learning framework (CXRNet) for accurate COVID-19 pneumonia detection with an enhanced pixel-level visual explanation from CXR images. The proposed framework is based on a new Encoder-Decoder-Encoder multitask architecture, allowing for both disease classification and visual explanation. The method has been evaluated on real world CXR datasets from both public and private data sources, including: healthy, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy and provide fine-resolution classification activation maps for visual explanation in lung disease detection. The Average Accuracy, the Precision, Recall and F1-score of COVID-19 pneumonia reached 0.879, 0.985, 0.992 and 0.989, respectively.

The rise of the more infectious delta variant has recently indicated the value of reinstating previously relaxed non-pharmacological and test-driven preventative measures. These efforts have been met with resistance, due, in part, to a lack of site-specific quantitative evidence which can justify their value. As vaccination rates continue to increase, a gap in knowledge exists regarding appropriate thresholds for escalation and de-escalation of COVID-19 preventative measures. METHODS: We conducted a series of simulation experiments, trialing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hypothesized working environment that is subject to COVID-19 infections from the surrounding community. We established cohorts of individuals who would, in simulation, work together for a set period of time. With these cohorts, we tested the rates of workplace and community acquired infections based on applied isolation strategies, community infection rates (CIR), scales of testing, non-pharmaceutical interventions, variant predominances and testing strategies, vaccination coverages, and vaccination efficacies of the members included. Permuting through each combination of these variables, we estimated expected case counts for 33,462 unique workplace scenarios. RESULTS: When the CIR is 5 new confirmed cases per 100,000 or fewer, and at 50% of the workforce is vaccinated with a 95% efficacious vaccine, then testing daily with an antigen-based or PCR based test in only unvaccinated workers will result in less than one infection through 4,800 person weeks. When the community infection rate per 100,000 persons is less than or equal to 60, and the vaccination coverage of the workforce is 100% with 95% vaccine efficacy then no masking or routine testing + isolation strategies are needed to prevent workplace acquired infections regardless of variant predominance. Identifying and isolating workers with antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing methods results in the same or fewer workplace acquired infections than testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. CONCLUSIONS: Specific scenarios exist in which preventative measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, including masking, and testing plus isolation strategies can safely be relaxed. Further, efficacious testing with quarantine strategies exist for implementation in only unvaccinated cohorts in a workplace. Due to shorter turnaround time, antigen-based testing with lower sensitivity is more effective than PCR testing with higher sensitivities in comparable testing strategies.

The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI &#8805; 24and < 24. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI &#8805; 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI &#8805; 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI &#8805; 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI &#8805; 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040).

This study determined the burden of pediatric LRTIs on hospital settings in British Columbia and the benefits of prevention strategies as they relate to healthcare resource demand. METHODS: LRTI inpatient episodes for patients <19 years of age during 2008C2010 were extracted from the BC Discharge Abstract Database. The annual number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. Sub-analyses determined the burden due to infants <1 year of age and high-risk infants. Population projections were used to forecast LRTI hospitalizations and the effectiveness of public health initiatives to reduce the incidence of LRTIs to 2020 and 2030. RESULTS: During 2008C2010, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations for diseases of the respiratory system in children <19 years of age and infants <1 year of age, respectively. Infants <1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and pediatric LRTI hospitalizations specifically due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. The average length of stay was 3.1 days for otherwise healthy infants <1 year of age and 9.1 days for high-risk infants (P <0.0001). 73.1% pediatric LRTI hospitalizations occurred between November and April. Over the study timeframe, 19.6 acute care beds were required on average to care for pediatric LRTIs which increased to 64.0 beds at the peak of LRTI hospitalizations. Increases in LRTI bed-days of 5.5 and 16.2% among <19 year olds by 2020 and 2030, respectively, were predicted. Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies could cause 307 and 338 less LRTI hospitalizations in <19 year olds in 2020 and 2030, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations require significant use of acute care infrastructure particularly between November and April. Population projections show the burden may increase in the next 20 years, but implementation of effective public health prevention strategies may contribute to reducing the acute care demand and to supporting efforts for overall pediatric healthcare sustainability.","output":"Acute care utilization due to hospitalizations for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review evaluates whether pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 by looking at the expression of immune markers such as immune cells and cytokines in order to have a better understanding on the pathophysiology of the disease, thus reducing maternal deaths. Pregnant women are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their weakened immune system. Studies demonstrate that COVID-19 is an immune condition which is marked by reduced lymphocytes and elevated selected proinflammatory cytokines. Similar immune expression has been demonstrated in pregnancy by several studies. In addition, the placenta has been shown to possess ACE2 receptors on the villous cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast and findings suggest that the coronavirus enters the host cells via these ACE2 receptors. The immune response in pregnancy increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Both normal pregnancy and COVID-19 are marked by decreased lymphocytes, NKG2A inhibitory receptors, and increased ACE2, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 it therefore safer to conclude that pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 development. Furthermore, the presence of the ACE2 receptors in the placenta may increase the risk of mother to baby transmission of the virus. Therefore, more studies investigating the link between pregnancy and COVID-19 are needed.","output":"Is pregnancy a risk factor of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Myopia in youths is an increasingly common global problem, associated with significant social and economic burden worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To explore the association of school education with myopia and investigate its scale, controlling confounding factors, such as age and socioeconomic status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2019 to December 2020 using regression discontinuity (RD) based on the Compulsory Education Law to examine the complex association of school education with myopia. Participants were youths from grades 1 to 12 before tertiary or university studies in China, including individuals from 815 primary schools, 373 junior high schools, and 145 senior high schools. Data were analyzed from February through June 2021. EXPOSURES: Participants born earlier in a year (ie, January to August) were assigned 1 more year of education and were considered to be in the treated group, while participants born September to December were considered to be in the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differences in mean spherical equivalent refractive error (MSE) and uncorrected visual acuity (UVA) between treated and control groups were calculated. RESULTS: Among a mean (SD) of 812 979 (55 953) participants across 5 surveys survey (mean SD 44.9% [0.5%] female participants; mean [SD] age, 11.19 [2.60] years), the mean (SD) MSE was ?1.30 (2.93) diopters and mean (SD) UVA was 4.77 (0.34) points. Every additional year at school was associated with an decrease in MSE of ?0.17 diopters/y (95% CI, ?0.22 to ?0.11 diopters/y) and a decrease in UVA of ?0.03 points/y (95% CI, ?0.04 to ?0.02 points/y), which accounts for nearly 66.4% (95% CI, 85.9% to 43.0%) and 78.9% (95% CI, 102.6% to 55.3%) of changes of MSE and UVA, respectively, among all factors for youths.

RDV is a relatively new chemical entity, 'ester prodrug', with no reported stability profile. Due to the urgency of its use and thus fast production, it is important to develop a stability-indicating method for its assay. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a C18 column (250  4.6 mm, 5 m) with dual detection: diode array at 240 nm and fluorescence at &#955;ex/em 245/390 nm. Isocratic elution of acetonitrile and distilled water (acidified with phosphoric acid, pH 4) in the ratio of 55:45 (v/v), respectively, was used. The linearity range using HPLC-diode array detection was 0.1-15 g/mL, whereas that using fluorimetric detection was 0.05-15 g/mL. As per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, RDV has been degraded by accelerated alkaline, acidic, neutral hydrolysis, oxidative, heat, and photolytic stress conditions. Possible degradation hypothesis of the parent molecule has been suggested and illustrated. The proposed methods have achieved selective determination of the intact drug with no peaks overlapping in all assumptions. Extensive degradation confirms threatened drug stability at thermal and basic hydrolytic stressing.

These fungal cupping erosions emit a characteristic fluorescent orange-yellow color when the wing membrane is transilluminated with 385 nm UV light. The purpose of this study was to create and validate the R package, countcolors, for quantifying the distinct orange-yellow ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in bat-wing membrane lesions caused by P. destructans. Validation of countcolors was completed by first quantifying the percent area of 20, 2.5 cm2 images. These generated images were of two known pixel colors ranging from 0% to 100% of the pixels. The countcolors package accurately measured the known proportion of a given color in each image. Next, 40, 2.5 cm2 sections of UV transilluminated photographs of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) wings were given to a single evaluator. The area of fluorescence was both manually measured and calculated using image analysis software and quantified with countcolors. There was good agreement between the two methods (Pearson's correlation=0.915); however, the manual use of imaging software showed a consistent negative bias. Reproducibility of the analysis methods was tested by providing the same images to naive evaluators who previously never used the software; no significant difference (P=0.099) was found among evaluators. Using the R package countcolors takes less time than does manually measuring the fluorescence in image analysis software, and our results showed that countcolors can improve the accuracy when quantifying the area of P. destructans infection in bat wing-membranes.","output":"COUNTCOLORS, AN R PACKAGE FOR QUANTIFICATION OF THE FLUORESCENCE EMITTED BY PSEUDOGYMNOASCUS DESTRUCTANS LESIONS ON THE WING MEMBRANES OF HIBERNATING BATS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have linked healthcare-associated infections to bacterial pathogens in the operating room (OR) environment. The purpose of this study was to determine the bioburden on OR surfaces to guide future quality improvement efforts and optimize OR cleanliness. METHODS: This study was performed in the pediatric ORs of a 200-bed, academically affiliated, childrens hospital with ~6000 general and subspecialty surgical procedures annually. Immediately after cases were finished, but prior to cleaning, the 3M Clean-Trace Clinical Hygiene Monitoring System was used to quantify bioburden (in surface ATP concentration) on 24 surfaces in each of 8 ORs. These 24 surfaces were previously identified by the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses as high-touch surfaces and various disciplines are responsible for their cleaning. Each OR was sampled 1C4 times. A surface passed the test of cleanliness if the result was <250 relative light units (RLUs). RESULTS: In all, 364 surfaces were tested. The median RLUs were <250, 250C850, and >850 RLUs for 7, 11, and 6 surfaces, respectively. Of the 24 surfaces tested, all demonstrated bioburden 250 at least once. Median RLUs for each surface ranged from 39-2282 and median RLUs for each OR ranged from 196 to 1534. The highest bioburden occurred following cardiac surgery (median 1534, range 24-13275 RLU) and the lowest bioburden occurred after neurosurgery (median 196, range 23-2475 RLU). The surfaces with the highest bioburden were the anesthesia keyboards (median 2282, range 347-38376 RLU) and core door handles (median 1471, range 140C6788 RLU) and those with the lowest bioburden were the Mayo stand (median 39, range 19-765 RLU) and back table (median 39, range 17-406 RLU). CONCLUSION: ATP testing demonstrated that most OR surfaces were contaminated with organic material. While OR surfaces prior to cleaning are expected to be contaminated, these data highlight the importance of cleaning/disinfection. These findings are being used to develop educational tools and interventions for the interdisciplinary OR team, which will focus on delineation of cleaning responsibilities, the use of appropriate cleaning products, and audits of end-of-case cleaning and terminal cleaning.

Yet, production remains expensive as it is mostly done in mammalian expression systems. As most therapeutic IgG require mammalian glycosylation to interact with the human immune system, other expression systems are rarely used for production. However, for neutralizing antibodies that are not required to activate the human immune system as well as antibodies used in diagnostics, a cheaper production system would be advantageous. In our study, we show cost-efficient, easy and high yield production of antibodies as well as various secreted antigens including Interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in a baculovirus-free insect cell expression system. To improve yields, we optimized the expression vector, media and feeding strategies. In addition, we showed the feasibility of lyophilization of the insect cell produced antibodies. Furthermore, stability and activity of the antibodies was compared to antibodies produced by Expi293F cells revealing a lower aggregation of antibodies originating from High Five cell production. Finally, the newly established High Five expression system was compared to the Expi293F mammalian expression system in regard of yield and costs. Most interestingly, all tested proteins were producible in our High Five cell expression system what was not the case in the Expi293F system, hinting that the High Five cell system is especially suited to produce difficult-to-express target proteins.","output":"Baculovirus-free insect cell expression system for high yield antibody and antigen production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections represent a serious threat to the world population and are becoming more frequent. The search and identification of broad-spectrum antiviral molecules is necessary to ensure new therapeutic options, since there is a limited availability of effective antiviral drugs able to eradicate viral infections, and consequently due to the increase of strains that are resistant to the most used drugs. Recently, several studies on antimicrobial peptides identified them as promising antiviral agents. In detail, amphibian skin secretions serve as a rich source of natural antimicrobial peptides. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities have been widely reported, but their exploitation as potential antiviral agents have yet to be fully investigated. In the present study, the antiviral activity of the peptide derived from the secretion of Rana tagoi, named AR-23, was evaluated against both DNA and RNA viruses, with or without envelope. Different assays were performed to identify in which step of the infectious cycle the peptide could act. AR-23 exhibited a greater inhibitory activity in the early stages of infection against both DNA (HSV-1) and RNA (MeV, HPIV-2, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV-2) enveloped viruses and, on the contrary, it was inactive against naked viruses (PV-1).

METHODS EMBASE/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, PROSPERO Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO and ProQuest databases were searched. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility and two authors were involved in the full-text review process. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative studies. RESULTS This paper focuses on a subset of 47 articles identified from the wider search and focuses on the issue of consent. Issues related to privacy, trust and transparency, and attitudes of healthcare professionals and researchers to secondary use and sharing of data have been dealt with in previous publications. Studies included a total of 216,149 respondents. Results indicate that respondents are generally supportive of using health data for research, particularly if the data is de-identified or anonymised. The requirement by participants to obtain consent prior to the use of health data for research was not universal, nor is the requirement for this always supported by legislation. Many respondents believed that either no consent or being informed of the research, but not providing additional consent, were sufficient. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that individuals should be provided with information and choice about how their health data is used and, where feasible, a mechanism to opt-out should be provided.

This increases the risk of a large number of imported cases which may cause a relapse of the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to prevent imported infection, the Shenzhen government has implemented a closed-loop management strategy using nucleic acid testing (NAT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and requiring 14 days of medical observation for individuals with an overseas tour history (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan province and other countries). Our study aims to describe the status of COVID-19 infection among people entering Shenzhen, and to evaluate the effect of the closed-loop management strategy. METHODS: We undertook a descriptive study and risk analysis by the entry time, time of reporting, and local confirmed cases in countries of origin. The NAT were completed in Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ten district-level CDCs, and fever clinics. RESULTS: A total of 86,844 people from overseas entered Shenzhen from January 1 to April 18, 2020; there were 39 imported COVID cases and 293 close contacts. The infection rate of people entering was 4.49 [95% Confidence interval (CI): 3.26C6.05]. Fourteen imported cases (35.9%) came from the UK, and nine (23.08%) came from the USA. People entering from the USA since March 9 or from the UK since March 13 are the high-risk population.

We use publicly available data from the National Center for Health Statistics on deaths by age, sex, education and race/ethnicity to assess the protective effect of a BA in 2020 compared to 2019. While the BA was strongly protective during 2020, the ratio of mortality rates between those with and without a degree was little changed relative to pre-pandemic years. Among 60 groups (gender by race/ethnicity by age) that are available in the data, the relative risk reduction associated with a BA fell for more than half the groups between 2019 and 2020, and increased by more than 5 percentage points for only five groups.

PPE must be available, safe, and effective. There is increasing evidence that the use of PPE can cause physical health problems. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to further examine PPE-related physical problems experienced by nurses as well as the role of wear time on these problems. METHODS Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a survey was conducted among nurses working for state or university hospitals across Turkey who actively cared for patients with COVID-19. Survey questions included demographic variables, type of PPE used, physical problems experienced, and length of time PPE was worn (4 hours or less, or more than 4 hours). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Three hundred and seven (307) nurses completed the survey. The most commonly reported problems were sweating when wearing a surgical (50.9%) or N95 (64.2%) mask, dry hands from wearing gloves (73.9%), perspiration when wearing overalls/gowns (84.1%), and vision problems when wearing goggles/face shields (47.9%). Logistic regression analysis indicated a signifcant relationship between > 4 hours length of use and the occurrence of the following: redness of the cheeks, dry mouth, redness of the nose bridge, and redness of the ears for N95 masks; dryness of the mouth when wearing surgical masks; skin dryness, sweating, and redness from wearing gloves; headaches from wearing goggles/face shields; and sweating when wearing overalls or a gown (P < .05 for all variables). CONCLUSION The results of this study show that physical problems related to the use of PPE are common and increase when PPE is worn for more than 4 hours. The availability, safety, and effectiveness of PPE are crucial to help protect nurses. Studies to examine PPE quality, characteristics, efficacy, and optimal use are necessary to maintain the healthy workforce needed to care for patients during this pandemic.","output":"Problems Encountered by Nurses Due to the Use of Personal Protective Equipment During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Results of a Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey assessed the symptoms/signs, protective measures, awareness, and perception levels regarding COVID-19 among dentists in Lombardy, Italy. Moreover, an analysis of the answers gathered in areas with different prevalence of the disease was carried out. All Lombardys dentists were sent an online ad hoc questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four domains: personal data, precautionary measures (before patient arrival; in the waiting room; in the operating room), awareness, and perception. Three thousand five hundred ninety-nine questionnaires were analyzed. Five hundred two (14.43%) participants had suffered one or more symptoms referable to COVID-19. Thirty-one subjects were positive to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and 16 subjects developed the disease. Only a small number of dentists (n = 72, 2.00%) were confident of avoiding infection; dentists working in low COVID-19 prevalence areas were more confident than those working in the Milan area and high prevalence area (61.24%, 61.23%, and 64.29%, p < 0.01 respectively). The level of awareness was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Milan area (71.82%) than in the other areas. This survey demonstrated that dentists in the COVID-19 highest prevalence area, albeit reported to have more symptoms/signs than the rest of the sample, were the ones who adopted several precautionary measures less frequently and were the more confident of avoiding infection.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak in North Italy: An Overview on Dentistry.

Fatty acids, such as arachidic acid (AA), self-assemble on graphite into a sheet of parallel stripes with a periodicity of twice its molecular chain length. The molecular pattern is thus defined precisely by the size and functionality of the headgroup and tailgroup of the amphiphile. Complexation of metal ions to AA fixes the number and location of the ion, which can serve as a precursor to semiconductor nanocrystal arrays. In order to understand the effect of the ion complexation, we carry out atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations of AA self-assembly in the presence of various metal ions. While the stripe orientation is dictated by the graphite lattice and the stripe periodicity is determined by the AA chain length, the size, shape, and degree of order of the stripe crystalline domain are influenced by the metal ion bond strength to the carboxylic ligand.

Governments and local authorities encouraged citizens to use sustainable travel modes, particularly walking, during the pandemic period. However, the high number of infections and deaths, especially in Italy, has strongly influenced the propensity of walking due to the emotional aspects of travelling. This paper presents a statistical analysis based on data gathered through a questionnaire in urban areas of Sicily focusing on travel by walking for either leisure or work. The evaluation of negative emotions that people who habitually walk for short distances in the study areas is the main focus of the present work.The data indicated a variation between three emotions: anxiety, stress, and fear.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. RESULTS: Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55-18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%).

Cardiac arrest before ICU admission; 11. Participation in another interventional trial in the last 30 days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Dexamethasone solution for injection/infusion is the investigational medicinal product as well as the comparator. The trial will assess two doses, 20 mg (investigational) vs 6 mg (comparator). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily on day 1-5, followed by dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously once daily on day 6-10. Patients in the control group will receive dexamethasone 6 mg day 1-10. All authorized medicinal products containing dexamethasone in the form of solution for i.v. injection/infusion can be used. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: a) Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomisation; b) Dynamics of inflammatory marker (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14; c) WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14; d) Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications) until Day 28 or hospital discharge; e) Independence at 90 days after randomisation assessed by Barthel Index. The long-term outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interviews using the Barthel Index. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the stratified permuted block randomisation method. Allocation sequences will be prepared by a statistician independent of the study team. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomisation process. The following stratification factors will be applied: a? Age <65 and &#8805; 65; a? Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) <3 and &#8805;3; a? CRP <150 mg/L and &#8805;150 mg/L a? Trial centre. Patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms. Randomisation through the eCRF will be available 24 hours every day. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial in which the participants and the study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded pre-planned statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is calculated to detect the difference of 3 VFDs at 28 days (primary efficacy endpoint) between the two treatment arms with a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Based on data from a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients in Brazil and a multi-centre observational study from French and Belgian ICUs regarding moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19, investigators assumed a standard deviation of VFD at 28 days as 9. Using these assumptions, a total of 142 patients per treatment arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate, 150 per treatment arm (300 patients per study) will be enrolled. TRIAL STATUS: This is protocol version 1.1, 15.01.2021. The trial is due to start on 2 February 2021 and recruitment is expected to be completed by December 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered on EudraCT No.:2020-005887-70, and on December 11, 2020 on ClinicalTrials.gov (Title: Effect of Two Different Doses of Dexamethasone in Patients With ARDS and COVID-19 (REMED)) Identifier: NCT04663555 with a last update posted on February 1, 2021.

The article focuses on the translational significance of antagonizing these proteins by using small molecules in patent literature, clinical and preclinical studies and also discusses future approaches that could be employed to block these proteins in the treatment of atherosclerosis. EXPERT OPINION : Based on the critical role of S100/calgranulins in the regulation of atherosclerosis, these proteins are potential targets to develop better therapeutic options in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Zoonotic genotypes of the virus have been found in diverse animal species with pigs playing a major role. Putative risk of zoonotic infection from livestock particularly swine in Sub-Saharan Africa including Ghana is poorly understood due to scarcity of available data, especially HEV sequence information. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from cattle, sheep, goats and pigs from Kumasi in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Samples were subjected to nested RT-PCR screening and quantification of HEV RNA-positive samples using real-time RT-PCR and the World Health Organization International Standard for HEV. Testing of all pig samples for antibodies was done by ELISA. Sanger sequencing and genotyping was performed and one representative complete genome was generated to facilitate genome-wide comparison to other available African HEV sequences by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 420 samples were available from cattle (n = 105), goats (n = 124), pigs (n = 89) and sheep (n = 102). HEV Viral RNA was detected only in pig samples (10.1%). The antibody detection rate in pigs was 77.5%, with positive samples from all sampling sites. Average viral load was 1  10(5) (range 1.02  10(3) to 3.17  10(5)) International Units per mL of serum with no statistically significant differences between age groups ( 6 month, > 6 months) by a T-test comparison of means (t = 1.4272, df = 7, p = 0.1966). Sequences obtained in this study form a monophyletic group within HEV genotype 3. Sequences from Cameroon, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Madagascar were found to share a most recent common ancestor; however this was not the case for other African HEV sequences. CONCLUSION: HEV genotype 3 is highly endemic in pigs in Ghana and likely poses a zoonotic risk to people exposed to pigs. HEV genotype 3 in Ghana shares a common origin with other virus strains from Sub-Saharan Africa.","output":"Detection and genomic characterization of hepatitis E virus genotype 3 from pigs in Ghana, Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text]","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and Nsp3 binding: an in silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a cross-sectional study which assessed the readiness to shift to e-learning in correlation with perceived effectiveness and satisfaction following the sudden shift caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among students and instructors.

Factors associated with death included male sex, diabetes, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency, and previous hospital admission for heart failure. Worse physiological stage was associated with mortality (p = 0.001), whereas anatomic complexity or defect group were not. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality in adults with CHD is commensurate with the general population. The most vulnerable patients are those with worse physiological stage, such as cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, whereas anatomic complexity does not appear to predict infection severity.","output":"COVID-19 in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kinder, Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene leiden psychisch besonders stark unter der Pandemie.

The relationship between them is complex, and the specific sustaining processes are still not well understood. In view of the rapidly evolving landscape, this literature review investigated scientific evidence for specific links between biodiversity and human infectious and non-communicable diseases to characterise identifiable relationships. METHODS A search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases using keyword algorithms identified relevant manuscripts published between 1 January 2000 and 18 April 2019. Qualitative data were extracted from 155 studies investigating links between or mechanisms linking biodiversity and infectious disease, non-communicable disease, allergic/inflammatory disease and microbiomes. RESULTS None of the reviewed studies documented causal evidence for a mechanism linking biodiversity and human health. The main mechanisms proposed to link biodiversity and transmission of infectious disease were dilution and amplification. The dilution hypothesis argues that an increase in species diversity leads to a decrease in pathogen prevalence. The amplification effect is the converse, that there is a positive correlation between species diversity and disease risk/infection prevalence. Several driving factors are postulated, including encounter reduction, interspecies competition and predation. In addition, it appears that scale, both spatial and temporal, highly impacts diversity-disease relationships. There is strong evidence that the early environment of a child, including maternally transferred prenatal signals, affects immune maturation, modifying later disease risk. Bi-directional axes communicate between the gut microbiome and the brain, as well as between the skin microbiome and the lung, leading to direct and indirect immune, humoral and neural mechanisms. The main challenges in assessing links between biodiversity and human health are the wide variation in definitions of health and biodiversity, and the heterogeneity in types of studies encountered, as well as the complexity of interactions in dynamic systems. CONCLUSIONS Contextually adapted integrative approaches, which maintain dialogue across disciplines and amongst all stakeholders, are most likely to generate robust evidence. Because of the relevance of local scale, research engagement must occur across levels to generate legitimate practices and translate into sustainable, equitable policies. Recommendations for future action include: improve the knowledge base on contribution of biodiversity to health, increase awareness of health effects of natural and near-natural environments and biodiversity, and promote synergies by increasing policy coherence.","output":"Links between biodiversity and human infectious and non-communicable diseases: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depopulation processes in Russiain almost all of its regions and settlementsare similar to those observed in almost all developed countries, and they additionally intensified in the post-Soviet period during the 30-year transformation of public relations in the country.

At the end of last year, COVID-19 vaccines finished developing and began to be large-scale administered. However, the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 is not clear yet. The current vaccine manufacturing capacity is highly insufficient, thus, it is urgent to implement an optimized vaccine prioritization strategy. To shed light on these vaccination issues in our study, we used a fluid model checking method to track the trends of COVID-19 dynamically. First, we proposed a vaccine-related epidemiological model, the SEIHRV model, to investigate the vaccine's impact on the pandemic based on previous studies. Then we embraced a fluid model checking approach to evaluate this SEIHRV model.

We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in patients with severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19. METHODS: We did a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 trial at 45 hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, and Spain. We included adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:1 with permuted blocks of five) to receive intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. Patients, care providers, outcome assessors, and investigators remained masked to assigned intervention throughout the course of the study. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement of two or more points (seven point scale ranging from 1 [death] to 7 [discharged from hospital]) in the modified intention-to-treat population. The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments.

At day 29, no significant differences were seen in median time to an improvement of two or more points between placebo (120 days [95% CI 90 to 150]) and sarilumab 200 mg (100 days [90 to 120]; hazard ratio [HR] 103 [95% CI 075 to 140]; log-rank p=096) or sarilumab 400 mg (100 days [90 to 130]; HR 114 [95% CI 084 to 154]; log-rank p=034), or in proportions of patients alive (77 [92%] of 84 patients in the placebo group; 143 [90%] of 159 patients in the sarilumab 200 mg group; difference -17 [-93 to 58]; p=063 vs placebo; and 159 [92%] of 173 patients in the sarilumab 400 mg group; difference 02 [-69 to 74]; p=085 vs placebo). At day 29, there were numerical, non-significant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +89% [95% CI -77 to 255]; p=025) for patients who had critical disease. No unexpected safety signals were seen. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 65% (55 of 84) in the placebo group, 65% (103 of 159) in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 70% (121 of 173) in the sarilumab 400 mg group, and of those leading to death 11% (nine of 84) were in the placebo group, 11% (17 of 159) were in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 10% (18 of 173) were in the sarilumab 400 mg group.

The impact of the pandemic and epidemic following through the life cycles of various plastic products, particularly those needed for personal protection and healthcare, is assessed. The energy and environmental footprints of these product systems have increased rapidly in response to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, while critical hazardous waste management issues are emerging due to the need to ensure destruction of residual pathogens in household and medical waste. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) is proposed to capture the environmental footprint of a plastic product throughout its entire life cycle. Emerging challenges in waste management during and after the pandemic are discussed from the perspective of novel research and environmental policies.

One deletion removes the end of the nsP1 gene and the beginning of the nsP2 gene, and the other removes the end of the nsP2 gene, the nsP3 and nsP4 genes, and all of the structural protein genes (M. Thomson and N. J. Dimmock, Virology 199:354-365, 1994). Like all DI SFV RNAs, DI-19 contains three regions that are conserved. Region a comprises the 5' terminus continuous with part of the nsP1 gene, region b comprises a central part of the nsP2 gene, and region c comprises the 3' terminus and the associated untranslated region. A deletion analysis of the 265-nucleotide b region (nucleotides 679 to 943, inclusive) was undertaken to determine its role in genome replication and packaging into DI virus particles. Deleted plasmids were constructed and transcribed, and the resulting DI RNAs were transfected into SFV-infected BHK cells. Putative progeny DI virus particles that had been released into the tissue culture fluid were then serially passaged in new monolayers together with added high-multiplicity SFV, and cells and tissue culture fluids were tested for the presence of DI RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. DI RNA that had all of the b region deleted was replicated well in BHK-21 cells, as shown by the presence of large amounts of negative-sense DI RNA and an increase in the amount of positive-sense RNA in the cytoplasm, but was packaged very inefficiently, as indicated by very low amounts of DI RNA in the tissue culture fluid. The genome of a deletion mutant that retained the 3' 224 nucleotides of region b was packaged successfully, but one that retained only the 5' 41 nucleotides was not detected in the tissue culture fluid. These and other data suggest that nucleotides 720 to 777 of region b are of particular importance in the packaging process. This finding agrees with data obtained with Ross River virus and contrasts with the well-studied Sindbis alphavirus major packaging signal that is located within the nsP1 gene.","output":"Deletion analysis of a defective interfering Semliki Forest virus RNA genome defines a region in the nsP2 sequence that is required for efficient packaging of the genome into virus particles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Muslim communities in the village facing the COVID-19 Pandemic attempts to find refuge from the plague and hope for survival However, this led to more caution, which may lead to xenophobia Via ethnography, this study unmasks the xenophobic attitude This research discusses the root causes of panic in the community so that remedies can be implemented The research attempts to explain, from a socio-anthropological viewpoint, how people and religious groups in the village perceive the pandemic of COVID-19 based on their belief in their faith and in the science The research takes place in Cigagak village, an area of approximately 7000 m2 on the outskirts of Bandung of West Java of Indonesia This study examines the selected respondents (20 respondents as the samples) from about 190 inhabitants (as the population) who had close ties to managing places of worship (mosques) and public places This study utilises a collaborative self-ethnographic method and qualitative analysis The influence of COVID-19 has moved to new exclusive and disintegrating practices from the inclusion-cohesive religious tradition Therefore, this study tries to find out ways on how to reduce exclusive perception and religious practices to a minimum level and how to disappear xenophobia Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, inclusive awareness and actions were re-established, and even social cohesiveness was fostered This study concludes that in its deep conviction nature, theology can change exclusive behaviour to be inclusive if it is based on the religious principles that are raised in response to human events In this case, the Muslim community in a village can change the fear of COVID-19 pandemic to be a reducer of the panic based on the support of the religious doctrines Contribution: This article used a collaborative self-ethnography with a religious socio-anthropological viewpoint This study could help to solve social problems through theological convergence in Islamic milieu, especially that of the governments formal Islamic organisation and organic Islamic leaders of the society ? 2021 The Authors","output":"Turning religion from cause to reducer of panic during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is a respiratory system disease has created inevitable pandemic In the course of disease;the uncontrolled inflammatory response may cause tissue damage 80C90% of patients undergo mild-to-moderate disease symptoms, the rest of the patients proceeds to critical or severe disease Type I Interferons (IFNCI) are crucial immune mediators in order to host responses to viral infection likewise those are major components of the innate immune system moreover serve as critical antiviral molecules IFN-I are within the first cytokines secreted during a viral infection Until now, IFN-I response has been evaluated in patients with COVID-19 in a few publications and its contribution to the viral load control and inflammation is very little known In those studies, the researchers have found that IFN-I deficiency which characterized by no IFN-  and low IFN-  production and activity is a hallmark of severe and critical COVID-19 Until recently, measurement of circulating serum levels of IFN- have been limited owing to the limits of conventional immunoassay technology Limit of detection problems of immunoassays has started to figure out thanks to SIMOA On the top of that, generally the platforms that use SIMOA technology is 10C100 fold more sensitive than most conventional immunoassays We should strive to do research that includes IFN-I with using platforms that include SIMOA technology, especially in severe COVID-19 (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] ?z: Bir solunum sistemi hastal olan Koronavirs hastal 2019 (COVID-19) ?nlenemez bir pandemi yaratt?

At the moment there are few reports about the behavior of echocardiographic images in the patients who have the severe forms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Identify the echocardiographic prognostic markers for death within 60 days in patients hospitalized in intensive care. METHODS: A single-center prospective cohort was made with patients hospitalized in intensive care for COVID-19 confirmed via polymerase chain reaction who got an echocardiogram between May and October 2020. A Cox multivariate model was plotted reporting the HR and confidence intervals with their respective p values for clinical and echocardiographic variables. RESULTS: Out of the 326 patients included, 153 patients got an echocardiogram performed on average 6.8 days after admission. The average age was 60.7, 47 patients (30.7%) were females and 67 (44.7%) registered positive troponin. 91 patients (59.5%) died. The univariate analysis identified TAPSE, LVEF, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, acute cor pulmonale, right ventricle diastolic dysfunction, and right ventricular dilatation as variables associated with mortality. The multivariate model identified that the acute cor pulmonale with HR= 4.05 (CI 95% 1.09 - 15.02, p 0.037), the right ventricular dilatation with HR= 3.33 (CI 95% 1.29 - 8.61, p 0.013), and LVEF with HR= 0.94 (CI 95% 0.89 - 0.99, p 0.020) were associated with mortality within 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for COVID-19, the LVEF, acute cor pulmonale and right ventricular dilatation are prognostic echocardiographic markers associated with death within 60 days.","output":"Echocardiographic 60-day mortality markers in patients hospitalized in intensive care for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has claimed over one million lives worldwide since December 2019 The complement system, while a first-line immune defense against invading pathogens, has off-target effects that lead to increases in inflammation, tissue damage, and thrombosis;these are common, life-threatening complications seen in patients with COVID-19 This review explores the potential impact of complement activation in COVID-19 and possible treatments targeting the complement system","output":"Pharmacotherapy in COVID 19: Potential Impact of Targeting the Complement System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are classical anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory treatments, which were used as first-line therapy at the beginning of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Besides the emerging data on their lack of efficacy against COVID-19 infection, such treatments have been associated with some severe health concerns, including those of neuropsychiatric nature, such as a possible increase in suicide risk. Here we report a case of a patient with no history of psychiatric illnesses, who abruptly developed depression with melancholic features, severe suicidal ideation (SI), and attempted suicide (SA) shortly after receiving HCQ for his COVID-19 infection. The case was followed by a mini-review of the heterogeneous scientific literature on the hypothetical association between neuropsychiatric symptoms, with a focus on SI and suicidal behavior (SB, including SA and death by suicide), when CQ and HCQ are used in COVID-19, rheumatologic diseases, and malaria settings. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of CQ and HCQ and the implications for neuroinflammation in suicide pathogenesis, the possible increase in suicide risk caused by these medications appears paradoxical and suggests that other underlying pathological trajectories might account for this eventuality. In this regard, some of these latter mechanistic postulates were proposed. Certainly the role and contribution of psycho-social factors that a COVID-19 patient had to face can neither be minimized nor excluded in the attempt to understand his suffering until the development of SI/SB. However, while this case report represents a rare scenario in clinical practice and no consensus exists in the literature on this topic, a psychiatric screening for suicide risk in patients using of CQ and HCQ could be carefully considered.","output":"Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Use and Suicide Risk: Hypotheses for Confluent Etiopathogenetic Mechanisms?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review seeks to explain four features of viral respiratory illnesses that have perplexed generations of virologists: (1) the seasonal timing of respiratory illness;(2) the common viruses causing respiratory illness worldwide, including year-round disease in the Tropics;(3) the rapid response of outbreaks to weather, specifically temperature;(4) the rapid arrival and termination of epidemics caused by influenza and other viruses. The inadequacy of the popular explanations of seasonality is discussed, and a simple hypothesis is proposed, called Temperature Dependent Viral Tropism (TDVT), that is compatible with the above features of respiratory illness. TDVT notes that viruses can transmit themselves more effectively if they moderate their pathogenicity (thereby maintaining host mobility) and suggests that endemic respiratory viruses accomplish this by developing thermal sensitivity within a range that supports organ-specific viral tropism within the human body, whereby they replicate most rapidly at temperatures below body temperature. This allows them to confine themselves to the upper respiratory tract and to avoid infecting the lungs, heart, gut etc. Biochemical and tissue-culture studies show that wildrespiratory viruses show such natural thermal sensitivity. The typical early autumn surge of colds and the existence of respiratory illness in the Tropics year-round at intermediate levels are explained by the tendency for strains to adapt their thermal sensitivity to their local climate and season. The TDVT hypothesis has important practical implications for preventing and treating respiratory illness including Covid-19. TVDT is testable with many options for experiments to increase our understanding of viral seasonality and pathogenicity.","output":"Temperature Dependent Viral Tropism (TDVT): Understanding Viral Seasonality and Pathogenicity as Applied to the Avoidance and Treatment of Endemic Viral Respiratory Illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Because of inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function in people with age-related memory complaints, we examined how self-reports of sleep quality were related to multiple domains of both objective and subjective cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study involving analysis of baseline data, collected as part of a clinical trial. MEASUREMENTS: Two hundred and three participants (mean age = 60.4 [6.5] years, 69.0% female) with mild memory complaints were asked to rate their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and their memory performance using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), which measures self-awareness of memory ability. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Trail Making Test, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, and the Brief Visuospatial Test - Revised (BVMT-R). RESULTS: Total PSQI scores were significantly associated with objective measures of sustained attention (CPT hit reaction time by block and standard error by block) and subjective memory loss (MFQ frequency and seriousness of forgetting). The PSQI components of (poorer) sleep quality and (greater) sleep disturbance were related to (worse) sustained attention scores while increased sleep latency and daytime sleepiness were associated with greater frequency and seriousness of forgetting. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality is related to both objective measures of sustained attention and self-awareness of memory decline. These findings suggest that interventions for improving sleep quality may contribute not only to improving the ability to focus on a particular task but also in reducing memory complaints in middle-aged and older adults.","output":"Sleep quality, neurocognitive performance, and memory self-appraisal in middle-aged and older adults with memory complaints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score > 4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively.

Aims: To examine the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We conducted a rapid review of the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, Ebola). Four electronic databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and the first 10 pages of Google Scholar) were searched (2000 to 10 July 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research with a sample size >80. Results: From the 3335 records identified, 52 with data from 54,800 HCW were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk for contact with infected patients, and being quarantined, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organisational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlighted the profiles of HCW who may be most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak as well as several potential targets for interventions to reduce distress.

Although fertility is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis, improved survival and assisted reproductive technologies have led to an increasing pursuit and incidence of pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulators that correct the underlying cystic fibrosis defect might improve fertility and thus far appear safe in pregnancy, though data are limited.Despite medical knowledge of SRH in cystic fibrosis, patients continue to report they lack sufficient education about these aspects of their healthcare, and cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary teams are ill prepared to counsel their patients. SUMMARY: Understanding of the effects of cystic fibrosis on SRH continues to improve, although many questions remain regarding optimal care from the choice of contraception to the safety of cystic fibrosis-specific medications in pregnancy.

By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate, and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location, and disease endotype. We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location. The downregulation of ACE2 (COVID-19, SARS) and ANPEP (HCoV-229E) viral receptors wascorrelated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma. Meanwhile, the increase in DPP4 (MERS-CoV), ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1 (influenza) was associated with increased goblet and basal activated cells.

BACKGROUND CVH has an increased risk of postoperative infection. CVH repair with synthetic or biologic meshes has reported chronic biomaterial infections and high hernia recurrence rates. METHODS Patients with a contaminated or clean-contaminated operative field and a hernia defect at least 9 cm had a biosynthetic mesh (open, sublay, retrorectus, or intraperitoneal) repair with fascial closure (n = 104). Endpoints included overall Kaplan-Meier estimates for hernia recurrence and postoperative wound infection rates at 24 months, and the EQ-5D and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12). Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population, and health outcome measures evaluated using paired t tests. RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 58 years, body mass index of 28 kg/m, 77% had contaminated wounds, and 84% completed 24-months follow-up. Concomitant procedures included fistula takedown (n = 24) or removal of infected previously placed mesh (n = 29). Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16). At the time of CVH repair, intraperitoneal placement of the biosynthetic mesh significantly increased the risk of recurrences (P  0.04). Surgical site infections (19/104) led to higher risk of recurrence (P < 0.01). Mean 24-month EQ-5D (index and visual analogue) and SF-12 physical component and mental scores improved from baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this prospective longitudinal study, biosynthetic absorbable mesh showed efficacy in terms of long-term recurrence and quality of life for CVH repair patients and offers an alternative to biologic and permanent synthetic meshes in these complex situations.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on medical students, to assess their anxiety level and their main anxiety sources related to this pandemic. METHODS: A Google Form was distributed to medical students using the virtual snowball sampling method. The form included the Beck Anxiety Inventory and additional 19 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, perceived level of knowledge about the epidemic, self\\\\risk perceptions of COVID\\\\19 and their anxiety levels about some other topics related to COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Overall, 3105 medical students with a mean age of 22.37  2.46, took the survey. Amongst the participants, only 32% of the students defined their knowledge about the precautions that should be taken during an epidemic disease as acceptable. Students reported highest anxiety level for the continuing spread of COVID\\\\19 in Turkey and transmitting coronavirus to another person. Clinically significant anxiety prevalence was 23.2%. Regression analysis revealed that factors that increased the risk of being anxious included being female, being other than a 5th\\\\year student, thinking that being a medical student would increase the risk of coronavirus transmission or being uncertain about it, being exposed to a patient with COVID\\\\19 or being uncertain about it, being anxious about the continuing spread of COVID\\\\19 in Turkey, being anxious about acquiring COVID\\\\19, being anxious for graduating and being on active duty, being anxious about a medical training interruption. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that anxiety is prevalent amongst Turkish medical students during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and they have a weak preparedness for a pandemic such as COVID\\\\19.

Although the spreading rate of COVID-19 is very high on October 6, 2020, the death rate is still less than 2.94%. Nonetheless, this review article shows that the lockdown has induced numerous positive impacts on the environment and on energy consumption. For instance, the lockdown has decreased the electricity demand by 30% in Italy, India, Germany, and the USA, and by 12-20% in France, Germany, Spain, India, and the UK. Additionally, the expenditure of the fuel supply has been decreased by 4% in 2020 as compared to the previous years (2012-2019). In particular, The global demand for coal fuel has been reduced by 8% in March and April 2020 as compared to the same time in 2019. In terms of harmful emissions, the lockdowns reduced the emissions of nitrous oxides by 20-30% in China, Italy, France, Spain, and by 77.3% in S?o Paulo, Brazil. Similarly, the particulate matter level has been reduced from 5-15% in Western Europe, to 200% in New Delhi, India, which in turn has enhanced the air quality in a never-seen manner in recent times. In some places, such as New York, USA, CO2 emission was also reduced by 5-10%. The water quality, in several polluted areas, has also been remarkably enhanced, for example, the dissolved oxygen content in the Ganga River, India, has increased by about 80%. Traffic congestion has also been reduced worldwide, and in some areas, it has been reduced by 50%, such as New York and Los Angeles, USA. Overall, while the COVID-19 pandemic has shrinked the global economy by 13-32%, the pandemic has also clearly benefited to other sectors, which must be considered as the spotlight for the permanent revival of the global ecosystem.","output":"Positive environmental effects of the coronavirus 2020 episode: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore has largely centred around migrant worker dormitories, comprising over 90% of all cases in the country. Dormitories are home to a culturally and linguistically distinct, low-income population, without on-site healthcare after-hours. The primary objective of this study was to assess the engagement and utilisation of a simple, low-cost, accessible, mobile health solution for remote self-reporting of vital parameters in dormitory residents with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical care. SETTING: Two large migrant worker dormitories with a combined population of 31 546. PARTICIPANTS: All COVID-19-affected residents housed in dormitories during the study period. INTERVENTION: All residents were taught to use a chat assistant to self-report their temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturations. Results flowed into a dashboard, which alerted clinicians of abnormal results. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was engagement rate. This was derived from the total number of residents who registered on the platform over the total number of COVID-19-affected residents in the dormitories during the study period. Secondary outcome measures included outcomes of the alerts and subsequent escalations of care. RESULTS: 800 of the 931 COVID-19-affected residents (85.9%) engaged with the platform to log a total of 12 511 discrete episodes of vital signs. Among 372 abnormal readings, 96 teleconsultations were initiated, of which 7 (1.8%) were escalated to emergency services and 18 (4.9%) were triaged to earlier physical medical review on-site. CONCLUSIONS: A chat-assistant-based self-reporting platform is an effective and safe community-based intervention to monitor marginalised populations with distinct cultural and linguistic backgrounds, living communally and affected by COVID-19. Lessons learnt from this approach may be applied to develop safe and cost-effective telemedicine solutions across similar settings.","output":"Remote monitoring of marginalised populations affected by COVID-19: a retrospective review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The romance plot is one of the most pervasive narratives in Western society.

The virus started from a single organism and is escalating at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and seems to be a never ending process. Understanding the basic dynamics and presenting new predictions models for evaluating the potential effect of the virus is highly crucial. In present work, an evolutionary data analytics method called as Genetic programming (GP) is used to mathematically model the potential effect of coronavirus in 15 most affected countries of the world. Two datasets namely confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) were taken into consideration to estimate, how transmission varied in these countries between January 2020 and May 2020. Further, a percentage rise in the number of daily cases is also shown till 8 June 2020 and it is expected that Brazil will have the maximum rise in CC and USA have the most DC. Also, prediction of number of new CC and DC cases for every one million people in each of these countries is presented. The proposed model predicted that the transmission of COVID-19 in China is declining since late March 2020; in Singapore, France, Italy, Germany and Spain the curve has stagnated; in case of Canada, South Africa, Iran and Turkey the number of cases are rising slowly; whereas for USA, UK, Brazil, Russia and Mexico the rate of increase is very high and control measures need to be taken to stop the chains of transmission. Apart from that, the proposed prediction models are simple mathematical equations and future predictions can be drawn from these general equations.

Experts have now called for greater integration of self-management interventions in clinical practice in light of these worrisome trends, supplanting the prevailing notion of a glucocentric approach. In this pilot study designed to complement a novel assessment program currently in development, we describe a concise screening tool designed to stratify the intention to follow through on self-management practices in people with T2D. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 3 regional primary care clinics. Individuals with T2D having the following characteristics were recruited into the study: (i) individuals with T2D between 18 and 65 years, (ii) fluent in English and, and iii) having been diagnosed with T2D for at least 2 years. We assessed the relevance of components in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) within the context of self-management behaviour in T2D. Participants were requested to complete a questionnaire containing questions related to intention, attitudes subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Based on their responses, the psychometric properties of the scale were then evaluated using both reliability and validity analysis. RESULTS: The Cronbach  value for all direct measures of TPB was excellent: intention to adhere to self-management practices (0.98), attitude towards self-management behaviour (0.87), subjective norm (0.83), and perceived behaviour control (0.66). The correlation between intentions and all 3 constructs of TPB was excellent (p < 0.01). Structural equation modeling helped determine attitudes and subjective norms as important predictors of intentions to follow through self-management practices. CONCLUSIONS: By first understanding the dimensions that influence intentions associated with self-management behaviour, clinicians have the opportunity to triage individuals with T2D who require greater involvement to bring about better self-care practices. Thus, our research attempts to bridge this gap by devising a psychometric tool suited to a regional setting which allows for an improved person-centered communication between clinicians and patients.

Henceforth, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prevalence and determinants of mental health outcomes (anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD, insomnia) among nurses across the globe due to the COVID-19. Methods: A PRISMA compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42020204120) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of mental health outcomes among nurses. Proportion random effect analysis, I2 statistic, quality assessment, and sensitivity analysis were carried out. Results: Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-44%, n (number of studies) = 21, N (sample size) = 13 641), 40.6% stress (95% CI = 25.4%-56.8%, n = 10, N = 4204), 32% depression (95% CI = 21%-44%, n = 17, N = 12 294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CI = 4.8%-38%, n = 3, N = 638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CI = 5.8%-78.6%, n = 2, N = 261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever). Conclusion: The study results highlighted a higher proportion of poor mental health outcomes namely, anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD and insomnia among nurses from different parts of the world.

However, many cell-penetrating peptides might present drawbacks due to causing cellular toxicity, or due to being entrapped in endosomes, or as a result of their degradation before they meet their target. In this work, a cargo transporting molecule, the Cell Penetrating Sequential Oligopeptide Carrier (CPSOC), formed by the repetitive -Lys-Aib-Cys- moiety, was tested for its ability to penetrate the cell membrane and transport the conjugated peptides into the cells. The cysteine residue anchors bioactive molecules through a stable thioether bond. The lysine supplies the positive charge to the construct, whereas the -amino isobutyric acid is well known to induce helicoid conformation to the peptide backbone and protects from enzymatic degradation. The present study demonstrates that CPSOC penetrates the membrane transporting the conjugated cargo into the cell. When we tested CPSOC-conjugated peptides carrying critical domains of Cdc42, a small GTPase implicated in exocytosis, the internalized peptides were found to be functional because they inhibited exocytosis of von Willebrand factor from endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies a trafficking event depending on the Cdc42 protein.

Recently, we identified transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) as a Wnt signaling amplifier. TMEM9 facilitates v-ATPase assembly for vesicular acidification and lysosomal protein degradation. TMEM9 is highly expressed in regenerating liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. TMEM9 expression is enriched in the hepatocytes around the central vein (CV) and acutely induced by injury. In mice, Tmem9 knockout impairs hepatic regeneration with aberrantly increased Apc and reduced Wnt signaling. Mechanistically, TMEM9 downregulates APC through lysosomal protein degradation via v-ATPase. In HCC, TMEM9 is overexpressed and necessary to maintain -catenin hyperactivation. TMEM9-upregulated APC binds to and inhibits nuclear translocation of -catenin, independent of HCC-associated -catenin mutations. Pharmacological blockade of TMEM9-v-ATPase or lysosomal degradation suppresses Wnt/-catenin through APC stabilization and -catenin cytosolic retention. Our results reveal that TMEM9 hyperactivates Wnt signaling for liver regeneration and tumorigenesis via lysosomal degradation of APC.","output":"TMEM9-v-ATPase Activates Wnt/-Catenin Signaling via APC Lysosomal Degradation for Liver Regeneration and Tumorigenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a relatively new, innovative treatment strategy to manage refractory hematological cancers, including some types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. This article outlines the CAR T-cell therapy process, toxicity, and complications, along with an overview of the currently known short- and long-term physical and functional sequelae that will be helpful for general or oncology rehabilitation specialists caring for these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a dearth of literature on the topic of rehabilitation of patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. Rehabilitation practices can be extrapolated from the limited functional information on patients who have completed treatment for lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Patients present with cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, reduced exercise capacity, neuropathy, and cancer-related fatigue. Physical activity and rehabilitation programs may be beneficial to address fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. SUMMARY: There is limited rehabilitation research in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. These patients may present with general deconditioning and neurological complications which translate to neuromuscular and cognitive impairment that benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention prior to, during, and after treatment. Studies measuring the impairments at baseline and evaluation of the impact of rehabilitation practices are much needed to support this.","output":"Rehabilitation Needs for Patients Undergoing CAR T-Cell Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lebanon's management of the COVID-19 pandemic is largely being maneuvered amid the country's escalating triple fold crisis.

Cancer patients are a very special population in this setting since they are more susceptible to viral infections than the general population. Several recommendations have been made on this issue, most of them based on expert opinion and institutional experience. It is essential to gather the evidence available for decision making. Objective: To review the evidence available in order to create a multi-institutional position from the perspective of scientific societies in Argentina involved in the management of cancer patients. Methodology: The review included two phases: 1) search and systematic revision of the medical literature; 2) consensus and revision of the document drafted by national scientific societies involved in the management and care of cancer patients using the modified Delphi method. The final results were presented at a videoconference with all the participants. Also, additional comment and recommendations were discussed. The final document was revised and approved for publication by the members of the panel. Results: The consensus panel included 18 representatives from scientific societies from Argentina who assessed the evidence and then made recommendations for the management of cancer patients in our country. International guidelines (CDC; ASCO, NCCN and ESMO) were considered as a background for analysis, as well as institutional guidelines and an open ad hoc survey administered to 114 healthcare professionals from the scientific societies involved in this study. The recommendations are grouped as follows: 1) general care interventions-training of the personnel, cleaning and disinfection of the hospital premises and patient scheduling; 2) treatment decisions-patient care, surgeries, immunosuppressive therapy, radiotherapy and screening; 3) ethical considerations-optimisation of resources, end-of-life care for critically-ill patients; 4) management of hospitalised patients; and 5) wellbeing of the healthcare team. The general recommendation arising from the study is that the management of cancer patients must adapt to the exceptional pandemic status quo without disregarding treatment or cure options. Moreover, healthcare professional accompaniment of all patients should not be neglected. All healthcare professionals must make a significant joint effort to create multidisciplinary teams to discuss the most appropriate measures for each particular situation. Conclusions: The scientific evidence available on this topic worldwide is in progress. This together with the epidemiologically shifting scenario poses unprecedented challenges in the management of cancer amidst this global pandemic. Furthermore, the key role of the healthcare structural organisation appears evident, such as the drafting of clear guidelines for all the stakeholders, adaptability to constant change and an interdisciplinary shared vision through consensus to provide adequate care to our cancer patients in the light of uncertainty and fast-paced change.","output":"Multidisciplinary approach to COVID-19 and cancer: Consensus from scientific societies in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) is a pathogenic coronavirus causing COVID\\\\19 infection.

We explore the theoretical possibility that RNAi triggered by SARS-CoV-2 might degrade some host transcripts in the opposite direction, although this hypothesis seems counterintuitive. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was therefore computationally searched for exact intrapairing within the viral RNA and exact hybrid pairing with the human transcriptome over a minimum of 20 bases in length. Minimal segments of 20-base lengths of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found based on the theoretical matching with existing complementary strands in the human host transcriptome. Few human genes potentially annealing with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30, the subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 and two long noncoding RNAs, were retrieved. The hypothesis that viral-originated RNAi might mediate degradation of host transcriptome messages was corroborated by published high throughput sequencing of RNA from infected tissues and cultured cells, clinical observation and phylogenetic comparative analysis, indicating a strong specificity of these SARS-CoV-2 hybrid pairing sequences for human genomes.","output":"Computational search of hybrid human/SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA reveals unique viral sequences that diverge from those of other coronavirus strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 remains ill-defined.

Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are the most widely used therapies for HBV infection, but they often require long-lasting administration to avoid the risk of HBV reactivation at withdrawal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to shorten the duration of NUC therapy by accelerating virus control, and to complement the effect of available anti-viral therapies. In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific T cells are functionally defective, and this exhaustion state is a key determinant of virus persistence. Reconstitution of an efficient anti-viral T cell response may thus represent a rational strategy to treat chronic HBV patients. In this perspective, the enhancement of adaptive immune responses by a checkpoint inhibitor blockade, specific T cell vaccines, lymphocyte metabolism targeting, and autologous T cell engineering, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and TCR-redirected T cells, constitutes a promising immune modulatory approach for a therapeutic restoration of protective immunity.

The sample was representative of the chronically ill, U.S. adult population in gender, race/ethnicity, region, and religious affiliation but older in age and higher in socioeconomic status. Participants completed online-administered measures 1 month before the March 11 pandemic declaration (T1) and then 1 and 3 months after it (T2 and T3). At T1 through T3, they completed measures of depression, anxiety, personal suffering, psychological well-being, trait resilience, optimism, hope, grit, spiritual struggles, spiritual fortitude, and positive religious coping. At T2 and T3, they also completed measures of social support, physical health, resource loss, perceived stress, and COVID-19 fears and exposure. RESULTS: Overall, people did not change substantially in psychological or spiritual outcomes over time. However, trait resilience increased and personal suffering declined. People highest in prepandemic suffering increased in spiritual fortitude. Racial/ethnic minorities increased in religious importance.

There is still limited data comparing their respective long-term efficacy (>1 year). This study sought to compare the very long-term outcomes of AVNRT ablation using radiofrequency or cryotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively included all patients who had undergone a first AVNRT ablation in our institution between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was recurrence of documented AVNRT. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 409 patients (274 females, mean age 49.9 year-old). Ablation was performed using cryoenergy in 260 patients and radiofrequency in 149. High acute procedural success rate (> 98%) was obtained and no permanent AV block was observed using both techniques. During a mean follow-up of 3.32.3 years, documented AVNRT reccurence occurred in 24 (9.2%) and 4 patients (2.7%) in the cryoablation and radiofrequency group respectively. The risk of AVNRT recurrence was significantly higher in the CA group as compared to the RF group (Hazard Ratio = 3.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9). Most of the recurrences after cryoablation occurred between 1- and 6-year follow-up (14/24; 58.3%), with 1/3rd of late recurrences after 3-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, only Koch's triangle anatomical variant was associated with AVNRT recurrence after cryoablation (Hazard Ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 2.7-16.3). CONCLUSION: While AVNRT recurrence rates were similar at one year of follow-up regardless of the energy used, long-term efficacy appeared higher after radiofrequency ablation. Strikingly, recurrences occured much later after cryotherapy compared to radiofrequency ablation. This article is protected by copyright.

Positive impacts on the spread of multiresistant pathogens and infections in general may be observed with the implementation of general preventative measures for the spread of infectious disease such as social distancing, reduced travel and increased personal hygiene. This pandemic has accelerated the development of novel technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, that may be used to fight other diseases. These should be capitalized upon to manage the ongoing antimicrobial resistance pandemic in the background. However, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic is fueling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance due to high rates of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, the high use of biocides and the interruption of treatment for other conditions. Clinical uncertainty driven by the lack of effective diagnostics and practice of telemedicine may have driven the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. As pathogens know no borders, increased focus is needed for infectious diseases still threatening low- and middle-income countries such as tuberculosis. Stewardship measures for future outbreaks should stress the importance of social distancing and hand washing but discourage the overuse of disinfectants and antimicrobials that are not proven effective.","output":"Implications of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Emergence of Antimicrobial Resistance: Adjusting the Response to Future Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the new coronavirus raging around the world, home isolation has become an effective way to interrupt the spread of the virus. Effective monitoring of people in home isolation has also become a pressing issue. However, the large number of isolated people and the privatized isolated spaces pose challenges for traditional sensing techniques. Ubiquitous Wi-Fi offers new ideas for sensing people indoors. Advantages such as low cost, wide deployment, and high privacy make indoor human activity sensing technology based on Wi-Fi signals increasingly used. Therefore, this paper proposes a contactless indoor person continuous activity sensing method based on Wi-Fi signal Wi-CAS. The method allows for the sensing of continuous movements of home isolated persons. Wi-CAS designs an ensemble classification method based on Hierarchical Clustering (HEC) for the classification of different actions, which effectively improves the action classification accuracy while reducing the processing time. We have conducted extensive experimental evaluations in real home environments. By recording the activities of different people throughout the day, Wi-CAS is very sensitive to unusual activities of people and also has a combined activity recognition rate of 94.3%. The experimental results show that our proposed method provides a low-cost and highly robust solution for supervising the activities of home isolates.","output":"Wi-CAS: A Contactless Method for Continuous Indoor Human Activity Sensing Using Wi-Fi Devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Our aim was to describe the outcomes of the latest treatment options of acute non-A non-B aortic dissection involving an entry tear in the aortic arch. METHODS Included were patients who presented between January 2001 and February 2020 with a non-A non-B aortic dissection involving the aortic arch but not the ascending aorta and with the most proximal entry tear located within the aortic arch between the innominate and left subclavian artery. Clinical data and operative details were retrieved from medical histories and surgical protocols. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed. RESULTS We analysed a total of 39 patients [median age 62 (52; 67) years, men 76.9%] with non-A non-B arch entry aortic dissections type. They underwent 15 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs, 20 frozen elephant trunk implantations, 1 hybrid arch replacement, or 1 conventional arch replacement. Two patients were managed conservatively. Twelve (31%) patients underwent emergent intervention, 12 (31%) were treated invasively within 2 weeks. Another 2 (5%) and 9 (23%) patients were treated 2 and 4 weeks after dissection occurred, respectively. Six (15%) patients presented with an impending aortic rupture, while 19 (49%) had at least one malperfused organ. Four patients (27%) died after thoracic endovascular aortic repair; the 30-day mortality following frozen elephant trunk was 0%. CONCLUSIONS Non-A non-B acute aortic dissection reveals a frequently complicated course requiring emergency intervention. The majority of patients required aortic arch repair within the first 2 weeks. Total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique seems to be low procedural mortality, and may become the treatment of choice in arch entry non-A non-B aortic dissection.","output":"Non-A non-B acute aortic dissection with entry tear in the aortic arch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current proposals for quantum compilers involve the synthesis and optimization of linear reversible circuits and among them CNOT circuits.

Its the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Healthcare-associated infections are the most frequent complication of healthcare and affect hundreds of millions of patients around the world, although the actual number of patients affected is unknown due to the difficulty of reliable data. The main goal of this manuscript is to describe the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted with pneumonia and the impact of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in those patients. It is a quantitative descriptive study with retrospective analysis of the clinical processes of 2436 individuals for 1 year (2018) with the diagnosis of pneumonia. The individuals with 5 years old represented 10.4% (n = 253) and 65 were 72.6% (n = 1769). 369 cases resulted in death, which gives a sample lethality rate of 15.2%. The severity and mortality index were not sensitive to the death event. We found 30.2% (n = 735) individuals with HCAP and 0.41% (n = 59) with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In only 59 individuals (2.4%) the agent causing pneumonia was isolated. The high fatality rate obtained shows that pneumonia is a major cause of death in vulnerable populations. Moreover, HCAP is one of the main causes of hospital admissions from pneumonia and death and the most pneumonias are treated empirically. Knowledge of the epidemiology characterization of pneumonia, especially associated with healthcare, is essential to increase the skills of health professionals for the prevention and efficient treatment of pneumonia.","output":"Epidemiological Characterization and the Impact of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia in Patients Admitted in a Northern Portuguese Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is an event to remember;it has unequivocally affected every part of our lives both ways It has opened up numerous research areas with abundant funding opportunities and avenues;oral research is just a small part of this research world In this review, we look into oral research in the COVID-19 era and India's position in COVID-19 research The salient features of the National Guidelines for Ethics Committee Reviewing Biomedical and Health Research during the COVID-19 pandemic have been described Some possible research topics in dentistry during COVID-19 and the need for the impetus to the dental community for oral research have been discussed ? 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications All rights reserved","output":"Effect of COVID19 on oral research in Indian scenario: An observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is always present in plasma, and it is biomarker of growing interest in prenatal diagnostics as well as in oncology and transplantology for therapy efficiency monitoring.

We exposed THP1 cells to healthy individuals plasma with (NP) and without (TP) cfDNA. In cells treated with NP, we found elevated expression of genes whose products maintain immune system homeostasis. Exposure of cells to TP triggered an innate immune response (IIR), documented particularly by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin 8. The results of mass spectrometry showed a higher abundance of proteins associated with IIR activation due to the regulation of complement cascade in cells cultivated with TP. These expression profiles provide evidence that the presence of cfDNA and its clearance in plasma of healthy individuals regulate fundamental mechanisms of the inflammation process and tissue homeostasis.

Methods We used German federal state (NUTS-2) and county (NUTS-3) data from national and regional public health and education agencies to assess infection risk and secondary attack rates (SARs) from March 2020 to October 2021 in Germany. We used multiple regression analysis and infection dynamic modelling, accounting for urbanity, socioeconomic factors, local population infection dynamics and age-specific underdetection to investigate the effects of infection control measures. Results We included (1) nation-wide NUTS-2 level data from calendar weeks (W) 46-50/2020 and W08-40/2021 with 304676 infections in students and 32992 in teachers; (2) NUTS-3 level data from W09-25/2021 with 85788 student and 9427 teacher infections and (3) detailed data from 5 regions covering W09/2020 to W27/2021 with 12814 infections, 43238 contacts and 4165 secondary cases for students (for teachers 14801, 5893 and 472 respectively). In counties with mandatory surgical mask wearing during class in all schools, infection risk of students and teachers was reduced by 56/100,000 persons per 14 days and by 30% and 24% relative to the population, respectively. Overall contribution to population infections of contacts in school settings was 2-13%. It was lowest during school closures and vacation and highest during normal presence class intervals. Infection risk for students increased with age and was similar to or lower than the population risk during second and third waves in Germany and higher in summer 2021. Infection risk of teachers was higher than the population during the second wave and similar or lower thereafter with stricter measures in place. SARs for students and staff were below 5% in schools throughout the study period. SARs in households more than doubled from 14% W21-39/2020 to 29-33% in W08-23/2021. Most contacts were reported for schools, yet most secondary cases originated in households. In schools, staff predominantly infected staff and students predominantly infected students. Conclusions Open schools under hygiene measures and testing strategies contribute up to 13% of nation-wide infections in Germany and as little as 2% during vacations/school closures. Tighter infection control measures stabilised school SARs whilst household SARs more than doubled as more transmissible variants became prevalent in Germany. Mandatory mask wearing during class in all school types effectively reduces secondary transmission in schools, as do reduced attendance class models.","output":"Infection and transmission risks in schools and contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany - a retrospective observational study using nation-wide and regional health and education agency notification data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical contention (MC) is a restrictive, vital but controversial measure, prescribed in the majority of EU countries to handle patients with psycho-motor agitation that do not respond to other types of intervention, with an imminent risk of physical violence and aggression involved This last resort approach implies risks for the somatic health of the contained individual that go from trauma injuries to, in some extreme cases, sudden death Despite these risks, somatic supervision and the monitoring of patients under MC is limited, being periodically and manually carried out by nursing personnel with portable equipment In this context, ensuring continuous monitoring using fully automated equipment is an uncovered yet urgent need There are several devices already in the market capable of monitoring vital signs, but they are not specifically designed for these type of patients and they can be expensive and/or difficult to integrate with other systems from a software perspective The work described in this paper gives answers to these necessities with the introduction of a low-cost system, targeted at psychiatric patients, for the acquisition and wireless transmission in real-time of physiological parameters, making use of micro-controllers for collecting and processing sensor data, and WiFi technology to upload the information to the server where a patient&rsquo;s profile with all the relevant vital parameters resides In addition to data collection and processing, an application aimed at use by nursing staff has also been developed to raise alerts in case any critical condition is detected","output":"A Smart Band for Automatic Supervision of Restrained Patients in a Hospital Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global crisis with 47,209,305 confirmed cases and 1,209,505 confirmed deaths worldwide as of November 2, 2020.

In an emergency response to the pandemic, we aimed to develop a quantitation method for HCQ, its metabolites desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ) and bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ), and AZM in human plasma. METHODS: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to develop the method. Samples (20 L) are extracted by solid-phase extraction and injected onto the LC-MS/MS system equipped with a PFP column (2.0  50 mm, 3 m). ESI+ and MRM are used for detection. Ion pairs m/z 336.1a??247.1 for HCQ, 308.1a??179.1 for DHCQ, 264.1a??179.1 for BDCQ, and 749.6a??591.6 for AZM are selected for quantification. The ion pairs m/z 342.1a??253.1, 314.1a??181.1, 270.1a??181.1, and 754.6a??596.6 are selected for the corresponding deuterated internal standards (IS) HCQ-d4, DHCQ-d4, BDCQ-d4, and AZM-d5. The less abundant IS ions from 37Cl were used to overcome the interference from the analytes. RESULTS: Under optimized conditions, retention times are 0.78 min for BDCQ, 0.79 min for DHCQ, 0.92 min for HCQ and 1.87 min for AZM. Total run time is 3.5 min per sample. The calibration ranges are 2-1000 ng/mL for HCQ and AZM, 1-500 ng/mL for DHCQ and 0.5-250 ng/mL for BDCQ; samples above the range are validated for up to 10-fold dilution. Recoveries of the method ranged from 88.9-94.4% for HCQ, 88.6-92.9% for DHCQ, 88.7-90.9% for BDCQ, and 98.6%-102% for AZM. The IS normalized matrix effect were within (10010) % for all 4 analytes.

DESIGN, DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The review comprised German and English language literature on refugees residing in shelters located in high-income countries, published between 1990 and 2021. We searched PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted information concerning the characteristics of the setting and the study population, measures for outbreak prevention and reported difficulties with implementing these measures. The findings were evaluated using descriptive statistics and were narratively summarised. RESULTS: Of a total of 1162 publications, 36 were included in the review, of which 19 were original research articles and 17 were guidelines/commentaries. In the guidelines, 37 different measures of infection control were mentioned. Among those, social distancing and isolation or quarantine were mentioned most frequently. In the outbreak reports, 27 different measures were reported, of which testing was reported most often. Different reasons why recommendations are difficult to implement in shelters were described, which are related to space, equipment, staff and financial constraints. Discrepancies between recommendations and actual practice mostly relate to the lack of preparation for outbreaks and the lack of appropriate measures to ensure intersectoral cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on infection control and outbreak management and the measures actually taken in refugee shelters differ considerably. Among others, this results from a lack of intersectoral cooperation between state ministries, municipal health offices and the administration of the facilities as well as from guidelines not sufficiently tailored to the characteristics of refugee shelters.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in shelters for asylum seekers: a scoping review of preventive measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease 19), the workers tried to search the drug/s for its management.

This study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies amongst healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody. METHODS: Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody. Multiple, overlapping sources of notification were implemented to promote the availability of the test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff members were cross referenced with data of the antibody tests. RESULTS: Of 7,013,6,212 (89%) staff undertook the antibody test during the study period. The overall detection rate of IgG SARS COV-2 antibody was 26%(1584/6212). Univariate analyses reveal that there were no differences in the prevalence rates in terms of gender or age. Compared to white staff members (18%), prevalence of the antibody was significantly greater in Black(38%) and Asian(27%) staff members. The combined prevalence for all BAME staff members was 32%. The prevalence rates of staff in general wards (43%) were significantly higher other areas of the trust. For staff in emergency medicine, intensive care and anaesthetics, prevalence was 23%, whereas for other clinical teams it was 21%. In terms of professional groups, prevalence rates were highest amongst nursing and allied clinical services (28%), followed by doctors (23%), whereas, it was lower for non-clinical staff(19%). DISCUSSION: This large multi-ethnic hospital-based study has described the prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers and determined socio-demographic associations of this prevalence including ethnicity, professional healthcare groups, and geographical areas of work in healthcare settings. The study provides information that may be useful in future COVID studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations as well as in healthcare settings.","output":"18 Socio-Demographic Associations of COVID Antibody in Multi-Ethnic Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique challenges to the medical community as the optimal treatment has not been determined and is often at the discretion of institutional guidelines.

This can have a detrimental impact on quality of care, the national response to the pandemic and its aftermath. Aims A longitudinal design provided follow-up evidence on the MH(changes in the prevalence of disease over time) of NHS staff working in a remote health board in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated the determinants of MH outcomes over time. Method A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted from July to September 2020. Participants self-reported levels of depression(PHQ-9), anxiety(GAD-7), and mental well-being(WEMWBS) at baseline and again 1.5 months later. Results The analytic sample of 169 participants, working in community(43%) and hospital(44%) settings reported substantial levels of probable clinical depression, anxiety and low mental well-being(MWB) at baseline(depression:30.8%, anxiety:20.1%, low-MWB:31.9%). Whilst the MH of participants remained mostly constant over time, the proportion of participants meeting the threshold for clinical anxiety increased to 27.2% at follow-up. Multivariable modelling indicated that working with, and disruption due to COVID-19 were associated with adverse MH changes over time. Conclusions HSCWs working in a remote area with low COVID-19 prevalence, reported similar levels of substantial anxiety and depression as those working in areas of the UK with high rates of COVID-19 infections. Efforts to support HSCW MH must remain a priority and should minimize the adverse effects of working with, and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The mental health of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: a two-wave cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a new contagious disease that has spread rapidly across the world. It is associated with high mortality in those who develop respiratory complications and require admission to intensive care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive therapy option for selected severely ill patients who deteriorate despite the best supportive care. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, extra demand led to staff reorganization; hence, cardiac surgery consultants joined the ECMO retrieval team. This article describes how we increased service provisions to adapt to the changes in activity and staffing. METHODS: The data were collected from 16 March 2020 to 8 May 2020. The patients were referred through a dedicated Web-based referral portal to cope with increasing demand. The retrieval team attended the referring hospital, reviewed the patients and made the final decision to proceed with ECMO. RESULTS: We reported 41 ECMO retrieval runs during this study period. Apart from staffing changes, other retrieval protocols were maintained. The preferred cannulation method for veno-venous ECMO was drainage via the femoral vein and return to the right internal jugular vein. There were no complications reported during cannulation or transport. CONCLUSIONS: Staff reorganization in a crisis is of paramount importance. For those with precise transferrable skills, experience can be gained quickly with appropriate supervision. Therefore, the team members were selected based on skill mix rather than on roles that are more traditional. We have demonstrated that an ECMO retrieval service can be reorganized swiftly and successfully to cope with the sudden increase in demand by spending cardiac surgeons services to supplement the anaesthetic-intensivist roles.","output":"Regional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval service during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: an interdisciplinary team approach to maintain service provision despite increased demand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes the care provided to a 64-year-old woman presenting with airway obstruction following recovery from COVID-19 pneumonitis, prolonged tracheal intubation and tracheostomy weaning.

MAIN FINDINGS Ophthalmologists have been largely impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, due to both the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and to the high contagiousness of the virus. The proximity of ophthalmologists to their patients have pushed eye-care providers to readapt their practices and develop alternatives to face-to-face consultations. However, teleconsultation has some major limitations and drawbacks, especially for ocular surface assessment that relies on high-quality graphic data for adequate diagnosis. Tele-screening, on the other hand, emphasizes on the importance of history-taking and listening to the patient in order to adequately prioritize appointments based on the presumed degree of emergency. CONCLUSION Despite all the enthusiasm, tele-screening as currently performed with the available tools is still not capable of completely replacing a standard ophthalmic examination for the assessment of ocular surface diseases. While waiting for new emerging technologies and future implementation of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence, decision making algorithms can help eye-practitioners remotely screen their patients to assess the optimal time for follow-up appointments.","output":"Ocular surface assessment in times of sanitary crisis: What lessons and solutions for the present and the future?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 16 February and 15 May 2020, 290highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) virus outbreakswere reported in Europe in poultry (n=287), captive birds (n=2) and wild birds (n=1)in Bulgaria, Czechia,Germany,Hungary andPolandand two low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N1) virus outbreaks were reported in poultry in Italy 258 of 287 poultry outbreaks detected in Europe were secondary outbreaks, suggesting that in the large majoryty of cases the spread of the virus was not due to wild birds Allthe HPAI outbreaks were A(H5N8) apart from three,which were reported as A(H5N2) from Bulgaria Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses isolated from the eastern and central European countries indicates that this is a reassortant between HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from Africa and LPAI viruses from Eurasia Two distict subtypes were identified in Bulgaria, a novel reassortant A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) that is persisting in the country since 2016 There could be several reasons why only very few HPAI cases were detected in wild birds in this 2019-2020 epidemic season and a better knowledge of wild bird movements and virus-host interaction (e g susceptibility of the hosts to this virus) could help to understand the reasons for poor detection of HPAI infected wild birds In comparison with the last reporting period, a decreasing number of HPAI A(H5)-affected countries and outbreaks were reported from outside Europe However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current epidemiological situation in many countries out of Europe Four human cases due to A(H9N2) virus infection were reported during the reporting period from China","output":"Avian influenza overview February C May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To determine whether perceived changes (i.e. perception of engagement during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic) in specific health behaviors differ by weight status (i.e. healthy weight, overweight, obese).

The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular, cellular and immunological features of RNV in order to unravel potential novel drug treatments for PDR. METHODS: A total of 43 patients undergoing vitrectomy for PDR, macular pucker or macular hole (control patients) were included in this study. The surgically removed RNV and epiretinal membranes were analyzed by RNA sequencing, single-cell based Imaging Mass Cytometry and conventional immunohistochemistry. Immune cells of the vitreous body, also known as hyalocytes, were isolated from patients with PDR by flow cytometry, cultivated and characterized by immunohistochemistry. A bioinformatical drug repurposing approach was applied in order to identify novel potential drug options for end-stage diabetic retinopathy disease. RESULTS: The in-depth transcriptional and single-cell protein analysis of diabetic RNV tissue samples revealed an accumulation of endothelial cells, macrophages and myofibroblasts as well as an abundance of secreted ECM proteins such as SPARC, FN1 and several types of collagen in RNV tissue. The immunohistochemical staining of cultivated vitreal hyalocytes from patients with PDR showed that hyalocytes express -SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), a classic myofibroblast marker. According to our drug repurposing analysis, imatinib emerged as a potential immunomodulatory drug option for future treatment of PDR. CONCLUSION: This study delivers the first in-depth transcriptional and single-cell proteomic characterization of RNV tissue samples.

Recently, another strain of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused an infectious disease (COVID-19) in humans which was detected for the first time in Wuhan, China. Presently, there is no specific therapy available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, social distancing, patient isolation, and supportive medical care make up the current management for this current infectious disease pandemic. The present in silico study evaluated the binding affinities of some natural products (resveratrol, xylopic acid, ellagic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin) to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) main protease compared to chloroquine, an inhibitor known to prevent cellular entry and replication of the coronavirus. The respective binding energies of the selected natural compounds and chloroquine towards the proteins were computed using PyRx virtual screening tool. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic attributes of the selected compounds were predicted using admetSAR. Molecular docking analysis showed that the natural compounds had better scores towards the selected protein compared to chloroquine with polar amino acid residues present at the binding sites. The predicted ADMET properties revealed the lower acute oral toxicity of the natural products compared to chloroquine. The study provides evidence suggesting that the relatively less toxic compounds from the natural sources could be repositioned as anti-viral agents to prevent the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Molecular Docking and ADMET Prediction of Natural Compounds towards SARS Spike Glycoprotein-Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the practice of medicine in Australia over the last 24 months.

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed. RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2-39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%-14.7%).

They expressed concern about the decline in requests during the lockdown as well as the well-being of some groups, such as victims from ethnic minority backgrounds, children, and victims with additional challenges. A majority of the shelters did not report changes in the content of the requests. Nevertheless, a third of them had observed instances of the virus and/or infection control measures being used by perpetrators as part of the violence and coercive control strategies. The shelters in Norway, as an integrated part of the welfare state, in general seem to have met the needs of their clients during the pandemic. Yet, the study revealed important inequalities and deficiencies in access to services for some groups, and in the general support and recognition by authorities of the shelters.","output":"Norwegian Shelters for Victims of Domestic Violence in the COVID-19 Pandemic - Navigating the New Normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Ethnic differences in the risk of severe COVID-19 may be linked to household composition. We quantified the association between household composition and risk of severe COVID-19 by ethnicity for older individuals. Methods With the approval of NHS England, we analysed ethnic differences in the association between household composition and severe COVID-19 in people aged 67 or over in England. We defined households by number of generations living together, and used multivariable Cox regression stratified by location and wave of the pandemic and accounted for age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, obesity, housing density and deprivation. We included 2 692 223 people over 67 years in wave 1 (01/02/2020-31/08/2020) and 2 731 427 in wave 2 (01/09/2020-31/01/2021). Findings Multigenerational living was associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 for White and South Asian older people in both waves (e.g. wave 2, 67+ living with 3 other generations vs 67+ year olds only: White HR 1.61 95% CI 1.38-1.87, South Asian HR 1.76 95% CI 1.48-2.10), with a trend for increased risks of severe COVID-19 with increasing generations in wave 2. Interpretation Multigenerational living was associated with severe COVID-19 in older adults. Older South Asian people are over-represented within multigenerational households in England, especially in the most deprived settings. The number of generations in a household, number of occupants, ethnicity and deprivation status are important considerations in the continued roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination and targeting of interventions for future pandemics.

Our hypothesis was that, a significant change in the number of pediatric injuries has happened in trauma centers. In the current study, we intend to identify the possible epidemiological shift in pediatric fracture patterns, by comparing the data from 'COVID-19 era' and the mean data from the past 2 years. To the best of our knowledge there are only few reports on epidemiology of pediatric fractures during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Data are reported in two sections. In the descriptive section, epidemiological data regarding pediatric fractures referred to Taleghani tertiary trauma center, including demographics, distribution curves, etiologies and fracture types are presented during the 'COVID era', from 1 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. In the comparative section, the aforementioned data are compared with mean data from the past 2 years, the 'non-COVID era'. RESULTS: Altogether 117 of the 288 trauma children (40.62%) had a fractured bone (145 fractures). Patients were mostly boys, with a mean age of 9.87 years (SD=5.27). The three most common fracture types in children included distal radius, mid-forearm and humeral supracondylar fractures. Compared to non-COVID era, the number of pediatric trauma admissions dropped from 589 to 288. No significant change happened in the mean age, male/female ratio and percentage of motor vehicle accidents. Proportion of proximal humeral, proximal forearm, carpal, and hand fractures declined. The number of open fractures significantly dropped (from 12 to 2). CONCLUSIONS: In Iran, overall trend of pediatric trauma has been decreasing during the outbreak; but the lack of reduction in proportion of accidents may pose an alarm that an effective lock-down has not been imposed. This study has implications as to preparing appropriate resources particular to common \\"COVID era fractures\\".","output":"Epidemiological pattern of pediatric trauma in COVID-19 outbreak: Data from a tertiary trauma center in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People turn to local media for information during crises such as the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

Using the results from a representative survey of Americans (N?=?5,461), the study demonstrates that local Fox and NBC viewers are significantly more likely to watch Fox News or MSNBC. As a result, watching local Fox is associated with less coronavirus risk because media consumers choose local Fox believing that it will align with their existing conservative views.

This study aimed to evaluate the biologic effects of ginsenoside Rb2 pretreatment on ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups with 12 rats per group: control; low tidal volume (TV), TV of 6 mL/kg, VILI, TV of 20 mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H(2)O, and respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute for 3 h at an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21; and ginsenosides, treated the same as the VILI group but with 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal ginsenoside pretreatment. Morphology was observed with a microscope to confirm the VILI model. Wet-to-dry weight ratios, protein concentrations, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured. RNA sequencing of the lung tissues was conducted to analyze gene expression. RESULTS: High TV histologically induced VILI with alveolar edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Ginsenosides pretreatment significantly reduced the histologic lung injury score compared to the VILI group. Wet-to-dry weight ratios, malondialdehyde, and TNF- in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly higher in the VILI group and ginsenoside pretreatment mitigated these effects. In the immunohistochemistry assay, ginsenoside pretreatment attenuated the TNF- upregulation induced by VILI. We identified 823 genes differentially presented in the VILI group compared to the control group. Of the 823 genes, only 13 genes (Arrdc2, Cygb, Exnef, Lcn2, Mroh7, Nsf, Rexo2, Srp9, Tead3, Ephb6, Mvd, Sytl4, and Ube2l6) recovered to control levels in the ginsenoside group.

All animals were monitored daily for the incidence of diarrhea until the age of 15days and their fecal score was recorded. Fecal samples were collected on days 3, 6 and 10 for microbiological and parasitological evaluation. Average fecal score throughout the experiment, incidence of diarrhea, duration and severity of diarrhea episodes were significantly lower in Eco group compared to the controls. Daily administration of oregano essential oil in calves for the first 10days of their life effectively diminishes the severity of naturally acquired diarrhea under field conditions and, under certain hygiene practices, possess a preventive effect against neonatal diarrhea syndrome.","output":"Evaluation of the in-field efficacy of oregano essential oil administration on the control of neonatal diarrhea syndrome in calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health care sector has made radical changes to hospital operations and care delivery in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men, and overall. SETTING: Yaound (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city population-specific and risk population-specific demographic/behavioral/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared with a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31%, and 23% among men who have sex with men, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaound, respectively, and 69%, 49%, and 23% among FSW, clients, and overall, respectively, in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use after COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships. Maintaining ART provision must be prioritized to minimize short-term excess HIV-related deaths.","output":"Assessing the Potential Impact of Disruptions Due to COVID-19 on HIV Among Key and Lower-Risk Populations in the Largest Cities of Cameroon and Benin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain tumor analysis in MRI images is a significant and challenging issue because misdiagnosis can lead to death.

In this study, we investigated whether combinatorial treatments of with thalidomide (TM) and dexamethasone (DX) might be new approaches to induce systemic immunomodulation on T cells and other immune cells that regulate the expression of co-inhibitory molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Na?ve splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice were sort-purified and cultured in vitro for CD4(+) T cell proliferation and regulatory T cell (Treg) conversion in the presence of TM or/and DX. Expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in proliferated and converted T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. We also quantified in vivo expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on splenic CD4(+) T cells and other immune cells isolated from TM- or/and DX-treated mice. Mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLR) were performed to evaluate the capacity of immune cells in carrying out immune responses. RESULTS: CTLA-4 expressions in effector T cells in vivo and in Tregs in vivo/vitro significantly increased upon TM/DX combinatorial treatment. Corresponding to increased CTLA-4 expression in T cells, the expression of ligand molecules for CTLA-4 significantly increased in splenic dendritic cells in TM/DX-treated groups. In addition, MLR results demonstrated that splenocytes isolated from TM/DX-treated mice significantly suppressed the proliferation of T cells isolated from other strains. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we suggest that TM/DX combinatorial treatments might be efficient immunomodulatory methods for regulating T cell immunity.","output":"Systemic Immunomodulatory Effects of Combinatorial Treatment of Thalidomide and Dexamethasone on T Cells and Other Immune Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought an unprecedented toll on vocational rehabilitation efforts to assist workers with disabilities in maintaining their careers.

This study is aimed to examine the effects of gender, age, and internet competency on internet usage among academicians during the MCO. A total of 223 respondents participated in this study through a purposive sampling method which was conducted among academicians using an online questionnaire. Chi-square analysis was performed to examine the association among genders, age groups, and internet competency with internet usage. The results of the study revealed that there is a significant relationship between the respondents' genders and internet competency on internet usage among academicians during the MCO (2 = 0.002, p<0.05). However, it was found that there is no significant relationship between the respondents' age and their internet usage (2 = 0.665, p>0.05).

However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. RESULTS: Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70).

METHODS: We plan to perform an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised trial at an intermediate-level COVID-19 cohort ward in Helsingborg Hospital, southern Sweden. We have estimated a required sample size of 120 patients randomised 1:1 to HFNC or Helmet CPAP to achieve 90% power to detect superiority at a 0.05 significance level regarding the primary outcome of ventilator free days (VFD) within 28 days using a Mann-Whitney U test. Patient recruitment is planned to being June 2020 and be completed in the first half of 2021. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the use of Helmet CPAP will reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the use of HFNC without having a negative effect on survival. This could have important implications during the current COVID-19 epidemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04395807 .

Older age, increased inflammation, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction may be risk factors for AKI in children with MIS-C. Although children with MIS-C may develop AKI, our study suggests that most experience mild disease, swift resolution, and promising outcome. Background Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a recently identified entity in association with COVID-19. AKI has been widely reported in patients with primary COVID-19 infection. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding renal injury in MIS-C. We aim to characterize AKI in MIS-C in this cohort identified at a major children's hospital in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children 0C20 years old admitted to Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital (MSCH) between April 18th and September 23rd, 2020. Patients were included if they met criteria for MIS-C on the basis of CDC guidelines. All patients were evaluated for the presence of AKI, and AKI was staged according to KDIGO criteria. Results Of the 57 children who met inclusion criteria, 46% (26 of 57) were found to have AKI. The majority of patients (58%;15 of 26) were classified as KDIGO stage 1. AKI was present upon admission in 70% of those identified. All patients had resolution of AKI at discharge, with 61% achieving recovery by day 2. One patient required dialysis. When compared with those without renal injury, the AKI cohort was older (P<0.001) and had higher median peak values of CRP (P<0.001), IL-6 (P=0.02), ferritin (P<0.001), and procalcitonin (P=0.02). More patients with AKI had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P<0.001) and lymphopenia (P=0.01) when compared with those without AKI. No differences in body mass index or sex were found. Conclusions Although children with MIS-C may develop AKI, our study suggests that most experience mild disease, swift resolution, and promising outcome. Older age, increased inflammation, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction may be risk factors. Our study highlights the substantial differences in epidemiology and outcomes between AKI associated with pediatric MIS-C versus primary COVID-19 infection.","output":"AKI in COVID-19CAssociated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a widely used dermal filler for soft tissue augmentation.

This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019.

To test the extent to which RMSIT improves respiratory muscle performance compared with a conventional respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET), a novel incremental respiratory muscle test (IncRMT), loading inspiratory and expiratory muscles, was designed to assess performance changes associated with respiratory muscle training (RMT). METHODS Healthy, moderately trained males and females (age: 26  5 yr, VBO2peak: 47  12 mLminkg) were randomized and balanced to three groups (RMSIT 5m/5f; RMET 6m/6f; PLAT 5m/6f). Lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and IncRMT performance were tested before and after 1 month of RMT. During the IncRMT, muscle activity and muscle deoxygenation were assessed via surface EMG and near-infrared spectroscopy of sternocleidomastoid (STERNO), intercostal (INTER), and abdominal (ABDO) muscles. RESULTS Two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of training for increased maximal voluntary ventilation (P = 0.001) and maximal inspiratory pressure (P = 0.017). Both RMT groups increased work of breathing during training sessions to the same extent (RMSIT: +17.4  8.9 kJ; RMET: +26.2  16.1 kJ; P = 0.143) with a larger increase in average mouth pressure in RMSIT (RMSIT: +20.0  15.0 cm H2O; RMET: +3.3  1.5 cm H2O; P = 0.001). After training, IncRMT duration increased in both RMT groups compared with PLAT (RMSIT: +5.6  2.1 min, P = 0.0006 vs PLAT; RMET: +3.8  4.2 min, P = 0.020 vs PLAT). At similar work, only INTER activity during inspiration increased after RMET. Higher performance after RMSIT was associated with higher activity in STERNO and ABDO, but after RMET, STERNO, INTER, and ABDO showed higher activity. CONCLUSION One month of RMSIT and RMET shows similar improvements in respiratory muscle performance despite different duration of training sessions. Also, muscular adaptations might differ.","output":"Effects of Sprint-Interval and Endurance Respiratory Muscle Training Regimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. So far, 30 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nearly 1 million people have died because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 C Gln690) at 10 ng/ml (0.13 nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was transient with a peak at 10 min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 C Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung vascular cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell signaling in lung vascular cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, autonomous taxis become a highly promising transportation mode, which helps relieve traffic congestion and avoid road accidents.

A 3-portal technique for LAOVH was used. A wound retraction device was inserted into the caudal portal after enlargement of the incision to 3-4 cm to simplify removal of the uterus with minimal tension. RESULTS Twelve dogs (median weight, 23.3 kg; range, 2.1-46.0 kg) met the inclusion criteria. Median uterine diameter was 3.0 cm (range, 1.2-4.0 cm). Median surgical time for LAOVH was 107 minutes (range, 82-120 minutes). Complications included mild hemorrhage from the uterine vessels in 1 dog during uterine removal through the wound retraction device and intra-abdominal uterine rupture in 1 dog which necessitated conversion to an open approach.

Over the course of the next few days, patient A rapidly deteriorated with need for intubation despite initial treatment with antibiotics and corticotherapy. Patient B experienced gradual worsening of respiratory symptoms, which required high-flow oxygen supplementation and IV antibiotics. Inflammatory markers were elevated in both patients, and CT of the chest was consistent with atypical pneumonia in each. Patient A received convalescent plasma as a rescue therapy, and patient B received remdesivir with convalescent plasma. Given the hypercoagulable state in each, patient A and B received enoxaparin and IV heparin, respectively. Slowly, hemoglobin and platelet counts dropped in both patients, with need for transfusion and hemodynamic support.

Method A custom-designed ambulatory voice monitor was used to collect 1 week of pre- and postsurgery data from 27 female patients with PVH; 13 of these patients were also monitored after postsurgical voice therapy. Normative weeklong data were obtained from 27 matched controls. Each week was represented by the DPI, standard deviation of the difference between the first and second harmonic amplitudes (H1-H2). Results Compared to pretreatment, the DPI significantly decreased in the patient group after surgery (Cohen's d effect size = -0.86) and voice therapy (d = -1.06). The patient group DPI only normalized after voice therapy. Conclusions The DPI produced the expected pattern of improved ambulatory voice use across laryngeal surgery and postsurgical voice therapy in a group of patients with PVH. The results were interpreted as providing new objective information about the role of daily voice use in the etiology and pathophysiology of PVH. The DPI is viewed as an estimate of potential vocal fold trauma that relies on combining the long-term distributional characteristics of two parameters representing the magnitude of phonatory forces (neck-surface acceleration magnitude) and vocal fold closure dynamics (H1-H2).

We previously identified Mamu-AG as a ligand for KIR3DL05. Mamu-AG is a nonclassical MHC class I molecule that is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta in rhesus macaques similar to HLA-G in humans. Although Mamu-AG and HLA-G share similar molecular features, including limited polymorphism and a short cytoplasmic tail, Mamu-AG is considerably more polymorphic. To determine which allotypes of Mamu-AG serve as ligands for KIR3DL05, we tested reporter cell lines expressing five different alleles of KIR3DL05 (KIR3DL05*001, KIR3DL05*004, KIR3DL05*005, KIR3DL05*008 and KIR3DL05*X) for responses to target cells expressing eight different alleles of Mamu-AG. All five allotypes of KIR3DL05 responded to Mamu-AG2*01:01, two exhibited dominant responses to Mamu-AG1*05:01, and three had low but detectable responses to Mamu-AG3*03:01, -AG3*03:02, -AG3*03:03 and -AG3*03:04. Since KIR3DL05*X is the product of recombination between KIR3DL05 and KIR3DS02, we also tested an allotype of KIR3DS02 (KIR3DS02*004) and found that this activating KIR also recognizes Mamu-AG2*01:01. Additional analysis of Mamu-AG variants with single amino acid substitutions identified residues in the 1-domain essential for recognition by KIR3DL05. These results reveal variation in KIR3DL05 and KIR3DS02 responses to Mamu-AG and define Mamu-AG polymorphisms that differentially affect KIR recognition.","output":"KIR3DL05 and KIR3DS02 Recognition of a Nonclassical MHC Class I Molecule in the Rhesus Macaque Implicated in Pregnancy Success"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is very rare, representing about 7% of para testicular sarcomas.

Within this sequence degeneracy, we identify a rare sequence combination capable of conferring SARS-CoV-2 resistance. We demonstrate that this sequence was likely unattainable during human evolution due to deleterious effects on ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity, which has vasodilatory and cardioprotective functions in vivo. Across the 25 ACE2 sites implicated in viral binding, we identify 6 amino acid substitutions unique to mouseone of the only known mammalian species resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Substituting human variants at these positions is sufficient to confer binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mouse ACE2, facilitating cellular infection. Conversely, substituting mouse variants into either human or dog ACE2 abolishes viral binding, diminishing cellular infection. However, these same substitutions decrease human ACE2 activity by 50% and are predicted as pathogenic, consistent with the extreme rarity of human polymorphisms at these sites. This trade-off can be avoided, however, depending on genetic background; if substituted simultaneously, these same mutations have no deleterious effect on dog ACE2 nor that of the rodent ancestor estimated to exist 70 million years ago. This genetic contingency (epistasis) may have therefore opened the road to resistance for some species, while making humans susceptible to viruses that use these ACE2 surfaces for binding, as does SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Evolutionary pathways to SARS-CoV-2 resistance are opened and closed by epistasis acting on ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction Preventive measures taken during periods of health crisis, specifically in pandemics, have consistently been associated with detrimental effects on mental health. Isolation and loneliness are indirect effects of these preventive measures. Given these premises, monitoring the behavior of the population in the face of these eventualities becomes important. Worry as an indirect measure of anxiety and stress enables one to recognize subjects who are vulnerable to phenomena of high uncertainty, since measures taken to avoid excessive contagion can have high costs for this population. This phenomenon has been consistently observed in other pandemics such as H1/N1 influenza. Objective To determine the prevalence of worry and perceived risk of contagion in the Guadalajara population during the COVID-19 quarantine and to identify differentiating effects. Method A total of 255 people from western Mexico (Guadalajara, Jalisco) voluntarily participated by answering the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) adapted to Mexican population. The average age of the respondents, aged between 18 and 70 years, was 31.71 ( 5.19). A total of 170 women and 85 men participated in the study. Results 40.12% of the population scored high levels of worry, making them vulnerable to mental health conditions. Subjects favored the prevention of a contagion regardless of whether they were self-isolated. The only variable that had a differential effect was sex (p &lt; .05), and there were no differences in educational attainment, occupational demandingness, and isolation between the groups.

Most patients who require in-hospital care are admitted to non-intensive wards, but their clinical conditions can deteriorate suddenly and some eventually die. Clinical data from patients case series have identified pre-hospital and in-hospital risk factors for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. However, most prior studies used static variables or dynamic changes of a few selected variables of interest. In this study, we aimed at integrating the analysis of time-varying multidimensional clinical-laboratory data to describe the pathways leading to COVID-19 outcomes among patients initially hospitalised in a non-intensive care setting. METHODS: We collected the longitudinal retrospective data of 394 patients admitted to non-intensive care units at the University Hospital of Padova (Padova, Italy) due to COVID-19. We trained a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to encode the conditional probability relationships over time between death and all available demographics, pre-existing conditions, and clinical laboratory variables. We applied resampling, dynamic time warping, and prototyping to describe the typical trajectories of patients who died vs. those who survived. RESULTS: The DBN revealed that the trajectory linking demographics and pre-existing clinical conditions to death passed directly through kidney dysfunction or, more indirectly, through cardiac damage. As expected, admittance to the intensive care unit was linked to markers of respiratory function. Notably, death was linked to elevation in procalcitonin and D-dimer levels. Death was associated with persistently high levels of procalcitonin from admission and throughout the hospital stay, likely reflecting bacterial superinfection. A sudden raise in D-dimer levels 3C6 days after admission was also associated with subsequent death, possibly reflecting a worsening thrombotic microangiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative application of DBNs and prototyping to integrated data analysis enables visualising the patient's trajectories to COVID-19 outcomes and may instruct timely and appropriate clinical decisions.","output":"Time-series analysis of multidimensional clinical-laboratory data by dynamic Bayesian networks reveals trajectories of COVID-19 outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, data on risks of immunomodulatory biologics have been limited, causing uncertainty for patients and providers whether to continue biologic therapy for chronic skin disease We aimed to investigate if patients treated with biologics were at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection and all-cause mortality once infected We performed a retrospective study of 7,361 patients prescribed biologics and 74,910 matched controls, cross-referenced with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health COVID-19 infection and all-cause mortality data through June 19, 2020 We included patients in the Mass General Brigham system with at least 1 prescription for a biologic between July 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020 Multivariable logistic regression was used on matched data to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19 infection between patients on biologics and controls, adjusting for age, gender, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) severity grade, median income, and local infection rate Multivariate Poisson regression was performed on COVID-19 positive patients to compare all-cause mortality, adjusting for gender, CCI severity, income, and local COVID-19 rate 7,361 patients treated with biologics and 74,910 matched controls were included in the analysis (mean age, 50 6 years;56 0% women, 84 5% white;mean age adjusted CCI 2 8) There were 87 (1 2%) infections and 7 deaths (8 0%) in patients treated with biologics and 1063 (1 4%) infections and 71 deaths (6 7%) in the control group Patients treated with immunosuppressive biologics were not at increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0 88, 95% CI 0 71-1 09, p=0 25) or subsequent mortality (OR 1 38, 95% CI 0 62-3 07, p=0 43) Given an absence of evidence that patients treated with biologics are more susceptible to COVID-19, patients should be encouraged to continue their therapy to prevent disease progression during this pandemic","output":"336 Risks of COVID-19 infection and mortality for patients on biologics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic that originated in China has already spread into more than 190 countries, resulting in huge loss of human life and many more are at the stake of losing it;if not intervened with the best therapeutics to contain the disease For that aspect, various scientific groups are continuously involved in the development of an effective line of treatment to control the novel coronavirus from spreading rapidly Worldwide scientists are evaluating various biomolecules and synthetic inhibitors against COVID-19;where the nucleic acid-based molecules may be considered as potential drug candidates These molecules have been proved potentially effective against SARS-CoV, which shares high sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2 Recent advancements in nucleic acid-based therapeutics are helpful in targeted drug delivery, safely and effectively The use of nucleic acid-based molecules also known to regulate the level of gene expression inside the target cells This review mainly focuses on various nucleic acid-based biologically active molecules and their therapeutic potentials in developing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2","output":"Nucleic acid-based therapy for coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Limited information is available on the impact of immunosuppressants on COVID-19 vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID).

Associations between care home characteristics, reported infection, prevention and control interventions, and COVID-19 status were described and analysed. FINDINGS: No resident developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study. There was no significant difference between: the number of care homes containing at least one test positive resident between the first (17.6%, 95%CI 6.8-34.5) and second round (14.7%, 95%CI 5.0-31.1) of testing (p>0.99); and the number of residents testing positive between the first (2.1%, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and second round (1.0%, 95%CI 0.5-2.1) of testing (p=0.11).

Interventions Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per twice daily (n=17) or matching placebo (n=17), taken orally for up to 14 days. Measurements The primary outcome was the time to release from quarantine. Secondary outcomes included the participant-reported secondary infection of co-inhabitants, hospitalization, treatment-related adverse events, time to symptom improvement, and incidence of cardiac arrhythmia. Results Amaravadi et al - Trial of hydroxychloroquine for outpatient treatment of COVID-19 3 The median time to release from quarantine for HCQ-treated vs. placebo-treated participants was 8 days (range 4-19 days) vs. 11 days (4-18 days); z-score +0.58, p=n.s. This did not meet the pre-specified criteria for early termination, however, this study was terminated early due to lack of feasibility. There was no mortality in either study arm. Limitation Since this study was terminated early due to a lack of feasibility, no conclusion can be made about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients 40 years of age or older quarantined at home.

Low- and middle-income Pacific Island nations face challenges in delivering quality maternal and newborn care. The aim of this review was to identify all published studies of interventions which sought to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care in Pacific low-and middle-income countries. Methods A scoping review framework was used. Databases and grey literature were searched for studies published between January 2000 and July 2019 which described actions to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care in Pacific low- and middle-income countries. Interventions were categorised using a four-level health system framework and the WHO quality of maternal and newborn care standards. An expert advisory group of Pacific Islander clinicians and researchers provided guidance throughout the review process. Results 2010 citations were identified and 32 studies included. Most interventions focused on the clinical service or organisational level, such as healthcare worker training, audit processes and improvements to infrastructure. Few addressed patient experiences or system-wide improvements. Enablers to improving quality care included community engagement, collaborative partnerships, adequate staff education and training and alignment with local priorities. Conclusions There are several quality improvement initiatives in low- and middle-income Pacific Island nations, most at the point of health service delivery.

This study codeveloped a thematic framework with carers to understand the forms these misconceptions take on Twitter. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify and analyze types of dementia conversations on Twitter using participatory methods. METHODS: A total of 3 focus groups with dementia carers were held to develop a framework of dementia misconceptions based on their experiences. Dementia-related tweets were collected from Twitters official application programming interface using neutral and negative search terms defined by the literature and by carers (N=48,211). A sample of these tweets was selected with equal numbers of neutral and negative words (n=1497), which was validated in individual ratings by carers. We then used the framework to analyze, in detail, a sample of carer-rated negative tweets (n=863). RESULTS: A total of 25.94% (12,507/48,211) of our tweet corpus contained negative search terms about dementia. The carers framework had 3 negative and 3 neutral categories. Our thematic analysis of carer-rated negative tweets found 9 themes, including the use of weaponizing language to insult politicians (469/863, 54.3%), using dehumanizing or outdated words or statements about members of the public (n=143, 16.6%), unfounded claims about the cures or causes of dementia (n=11, 1.3%), or providing armchair diagnoses of dementia (n=21, 2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use participatory methods to develop a framework that identifies dementia misconceptions on Twitter. We show that misconceptions and stigmatizing language are not rare. They manifest through minimizing and underestimating language. Web-based campaigns aiming to reduce discrimination and stigma about dementia could target those who use negative vocabulary and reduce the misconceptions that are being propagated, thus improving general awareness.","output":"Investigation of Carers Perspectives of Dementia Misconceptions on Twitter: Focus Group Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a condition caused by a mutation of the PHOX2B gene and an incidence of 1 in 50,000 live births. Clinically the condition is characterized by autonomic nervous system dysfunction, the most prominent feature of which is the failure of respiratory homeostasis during sleep. In patients severely affected, life-long ventilatory support is required. This might start as early as the newborn period. Subsequent adjustments are required due to their growth and development. The role of Volume-Assured Pressure Support (VAPS) ventilation in treatment of CCHS was only described in a couple reports before. REPORT OF CASE(S): A 17-year-old female patient born at term and diagnosed with CCHS at birth at our center with a PHOX2B mutation confirmed. Her daytime ventilatory support was weaned at age 18 months and the tracheostomy was removed at age 10 years old. She relocated to another state, was lost to follow-up, and returned this year for adjustments of her ventilator whose settings had not been adjusted for several years. She was on a Trilogy 100 ventilator, in pressure-controlled mode with settings of EPAP 5, IPAP 20, and a rate of 22/min without supplemental oxygen. Her measured weight is 69kg, body mass index (BMI) 27. The patient complained of difficulty breathing while on those settings and reported decreased desire to use the machine. The patient was empirically switched to VAPS due to titration availability limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial AVAPS settings were: EPAP 4C7, PS 3C12, breath rate 16/min, TV 350mL. Upon implementing the changes, the patient reported improved comfort and increased usage. Average minute ventilation decreased from 10.5 to 5.8 L/min, patient triggered breaths increased from 1.1% to 12.3%, average breaths per minute decreased from 22.0/min to 16.2/min, the average peak flow 31.8 to 26.2L/min, tidal volume decreased from 463 to 355mL. CONCLUSION: AVAPS ventilation can be successfully used in managing patients with CCHS, and it might be superior to pressure-controlled mode in certain cases, improving patient comfort and compliance.

However, because SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays may remain positive for months after infection, positive results may represent active or past infection. We determined the prevalence and infectiousness of patients who were admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission screening. METHODS: We conducted an observational study at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics from July 7 to October 25, 2020. All patients admitted without suspicion of COVID-19 were included, and medical records of those with a positive admission screening test were reviewed. Infectiousness was determined using patient history, PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, and serology. RESULTS: In total, 5,913 patients were screened and admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Of these, 101 had positive admission RT-PCR results; 36 of these patients were excluded because they had respiratory signs/symptoms on admission on chart review. Also, 65 patients (1.1%) did not have respiratory symptoms. Finally, 55 patients had Ct values available and were included in this analysis. The median age of the final cohort was 56 years and 51% were male. Our assessment revealed that 23 patients (42%) were likely infectious. The median duration of in-hospital isolation was 5 days for those likely infectious and 2 days for those deemed noninfectious. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was infrequent among patients admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. An assessment of the likelihood of infectiousness using clinical history, RT-PCR Ct values, and serology may help in making the determination to discontinue isolation and conserve resources.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admission screening and assessment of infectiousness at an academic medical center in Iowa, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated intensified handwashing and mask usage for healthcare staff.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2013 to September 2016, 195 patients received 267 sessions of CT-guided RFA for liver tumors at our institution. The CT images during and immediately after the RFA were retrospectively reviewed. The frequency of hemobilia development and clinical outcome of patients with hemobilia were studied. Risk factors were identified by comparison between the hemobilia and non-hemobilia groups using univariate and multivariate analysis. The clinical courses of patients with hemobilia were also reviewed. RESULTS The frequency of CT detected hemobilia after RFA was 8.2% (22/267). The majority of the clinical courses were self-limited. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor numbers (p = 0.015), the central type puncture track (p < 0.001), the length of the puncture track (p = 0.033), and the platelet count (p = 0.026) were significantly associated with the development of hemobilia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the central type puncture track (p < 0.024) and the platelet count (p = 0.023) were significant independent risk factors. CONCLUSION Detection of hemobilia on CT images immediately after percutaneous RFA for liver tumors was not rare. Low platelet count and central type puncture track are independent risk factors. In most cases, hemobilia presented as a minor complication with favorable prognosis.","output":"Hemobilia after CT-guided radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors: frequency, risk factors, and clinical significance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: From the beginning of the corona pandemic until August 19, 2020, more than 21,989,366 cases have been reported worldwide C 228,495 in Germany alone, including 12,648 children aged 0C14. In many countries, the proportion of infected children in the total population is comparatively low; in addition, children often have no or milder symptoms and are less likely to transmit the pathogen to adults than the other way round. Based on the registration data in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the symptoms of children in comparison with adults and the likely routes of transmission are presented below. Materials and methods: The documentation of the mandatory reports includes personal data (name, date of birth, gender, place of residence), disease characteristics (date of report, date of onset of the disease, symptoms), possible contact persons (family, others) and i.a. possible activity or care in childrens community facilities. All reports were viewed, especially with regard to likely transmission routes. Results: From March 1 to July 31, 2020, 1,977 infected people were reported, including 138 children between the ages of 0 and 14 years. Children had fewer and milder symptoms than adults. None of the children experienced severe respiratory symptoms or the need for ventilation. 62% of the children had no symptoms at all (19% adults), 5% of the children were hospitalized (24% adults), and none of the children died (3.8% adults). After excluding a cluster of 34 children from refugee accommodations and 14 children from a parish, 78% of the remaining 90 children had been infected by an adult within the family, and only 4% were likely to have a reverse transmission route. In 5.5% of cases, transmission in a community facility was likely. Discussion: The results of the registration data from Frankfurt am Main, Germany confirm the results published in other countries: Children are less likely to become infected, and if infected, their symptoms are less severe than in adults, and they are apparently not the main drivers of virus transmission. Therefore, scientific medical associations strongly recommend reopening schools.","output":"Sars-Cov-2 in children C insights and conclusions from the mandatory reporting data in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, MarchCJuly 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly identified enteric alphacoronavirus that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets in China.

CASE REPORT A 54-year-old female morbidly obese patient (136k; 167cm; body mass index (BMI): 48kg/m2) was admitted for bariatric surgery. She had congenital SIT, a history of open cholecystectomy and, despite implementing the suggestions of the dietitian and endocrinologist, she had failed to lose weight. A standard LSG was performed successfully using the French method. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. She is now in the 4th month with a weight loss of 30kg. DISCUSSION SIT is a rare congenital condition, occurring in 1/10,000 to 1/50,000 live births. Organ function is generally normal, although it may sometimes be accompanied by respiratory or cardiovascular anomalies. Although undertaking LSG on morbidly obese patients with SIT may seem a daunting proposition at first, experienced laparoscopic surgeons can manage this operation with success.

The developed sensor combines the high chemical sensitivity of MXene and the continuity of large-area high-quality graphene to form an ultra-sensitive virus-sensing transduction material (VSTM). Through polymer linking, we are able to utilize antibodyCantigen binding to achieve electrochemical signal transduction when viruses are deposited onto the VSTM surface. The MXeneCgraphene VSTM was integrated into a microfluidic channel that can directly receive viruses in solution. The developed sensor was tested with various concentrations of antigens from two viruses: inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus ranging from 125 to 250,000 copies/mL and a recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein ranging from 1 fg/mL to 10 pg/mL. The average response time was about 50 ms, which is significantly faster than the existing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (>3 h). The low limit of detection (125 copies/mL for the influenza virus and 1 fg/mL for the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein) has demonstrated the sensitivity of the MXeneCgraphene VSTM on the FET platform to virus sensing. Especially, the high signal-to-viral load ratio (10% change in source-drain current and gate voltage) also demonstrates the ultra-sensitivity of the developed MXeneCgraphene FET sensor. In addition, the specificity of the sensor was also demonstrated by depositing the inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus and the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein onto microfluidic channels with opposite antibodies, producing signal differences that are about 10 times lower. Thus, we have successfully fabricated a relatively low-cost, ultrasensitive, fast-responding, and specific inactivated influenza A (H1N1) and 2019-nCoV sensor with the MXeneCgraphene VSTM.","output":"MXeneCGraphene Field-Effect Transistor Sensing of Influenza Virus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is a world-historical event We live in a post-Covid world This paper addresses how Gestalt therapy's concepts of intentionality, contacting, and relationality come together as the intentionality of contacting that form the fabric of relationality These concepts are presented from a clinical phenomenological and personal perspective of the author in New York City at the height of the pandemic This article is an adaptation of a May 16, 2020, presentation at the online conference \\"Dialogues on Psychotherapy at the Time of Coronavirus,\\" sponsored by Instituto di Gestalt HCC, Italy (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Intentionality: The fabric of relationality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However, unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000 acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into 10 clusters, to ensure equal water distribution amongst the users (field owners) in the wide area. The proposed automation algorithm handles the complexity of maintaining proper water pressure throughout the pipe network, scheduling the pump, and controlling the water outlets. Mathematical models are presented for proper dimensioning of the AWD. A low-power and long-range sensor node is developed due to the lack of cellular data coverage in rural areas, and its functionality is tested using an IoT platform for small-scale field trials.","output":"Dimensioning of Wide-Area Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) System for IoT-Based Automation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY Background Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater offers an unbiased and near real-time tool to track circulation of SARS-CoV-2 at a local scale, next to other epidemic indicators such as hospital admissions and test data. However, individual measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage are noisy, inherently variable, and can be left-censored. Aim We aimed to infer latent virus loads in a comprehensive sewage surveillance program that includes all sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Netherlands and covers 99.6% of the Dutch population. Methods A multilevel Bayesian penalized spline model was developed and applied to estimate time- and STP-specific virus loads based on water flow adjusted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR data from 1-4 sewage samples per week for each of the >300 STPs. Results The model provided an adequate fit to the data and captured the epidemic upsurges and downturns in the Netherlands, despite substantial day-to-day measurement variation. Estimated STP virus loads varied by more than two orders of magnitude, from approximately 1012 (virus particles per 100,000 persons per day) in the epidemic trough in August 2020 to almost 1015 in many STPs in January 2022. Epidemics at the local levels were slightly shifted between STPs and municipalities, which resulted in less pronounced peaks and troughs at the national level.

The philosophical type can be carried out through an integrated combination of fiqh and maqasid al-shariah to produce a fiqh maqasid discourse in the Indonesian Ulema Councils Fatwa Number 14 of 2021. Fiqh maqasid epistemology also needs to be addressed in this discourse. Efforts to reveal the existence of fiqh maqasid in the MUI fatwa and its epistemological building in this study used content analysis methods and Islamic legal philosophy as the approach. This research concludes that the fiqh maqasid paradigm has been applied in the MUI fatwa by using tarjih based on maqasid al-shariah. In the realm of epistemology, fiqh maqasid originates from transcendental texts supported by ijma, and qawaid al-fiqh. The paradigm in fiqh maqasid involves an integral relationship between ushul al-fiqh, fiqh, reality, maqasid al-shariah, and qawaid al-fiqh. While the truth in fiqh maqasid is based on the pragmatic theory of truth using instruments of utility, workability, and satisfactory consequences.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the drop in the number of outpatients in the Ophthalmic Emergency Service (OES) in the Eye Clinic of University of Bari during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from a tertiary referral center in Southern Italy was performed. Demographics and medical characteristics of patients examined in the OES between March 10 th , 2020 and May 3 rd , 2020 were assessed and compared with records from the same period in 2019. We categorized the patients by sex, age group, and by the type of eye disease that was recorded as the principal diagnosis. The change (%) in the number of patients and diseases between the study periods was analyzed. Results: We observed a reduction in the number of OES visits during the lockdown (-63.4%) compared to the number of visits in 2019. The greatest changes were observed in the youngest (20 years;-76.6%) and the most elderly patients (81 years;-70.9%). The decrease in the number of patients presenting with each pathology ranged from -82% to -28.5%, depending on the pathology, and mainly involved the orbital and palpebral pathologies, anterior segment disorders, non-specific visual symptoms, and minor injuries. The diagnosis of chronic pathologies, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and vitreous haemorrhage increased by 134%, 100%, and 75%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results revealed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on OES activities in the Eye Clinic of University of Bari. A drop in number of visits across all age groups was observed. The number of patients presenting with minor and nonurgent conditions decreased, whereas the number of patients presenting with chronic diseases and urgent but deferrable conditions increased.","output":"Eye-related emergencies incidence at a tertiary referral center in Southern Italy during COVID-19 related lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social Media usage has been shown to increase in situations of natural disaster and other crises.

To control emerging infections, however, vaccines will need to be delivered to older individuals who, unlike infants, probably have had prior infection or vaccination with related viruses and thus have cross-reactive antibodies against the vaccines. Whether and how these cross-reactive antibodies impact live attenuated vaccination efficacy is unclear. Using an open-label randomized trial design, we show that subjects with a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titres from a prior inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccination enhanced yellow fever (YF) immunogenicity upon YF vaccination. Enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies prolonged YF vaccine viraemia, provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses, and induced adhesion molecules intrinsic to the activating Fc-receptor signalling pathway, namely immune semaphorins, facilitating immune cell interactions and trafficking. Our findings clinically demonstrate antibody-enhanced infection and suggest that vaccine efficacy could be improved by exploiting cross-reactive antibodies.

The present study was conducted to examine the effect of two different training methods (lectures vs. a social networking app) on the diagnosis and management of pain in mechanically-ventilated patients. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 70 nurses working in two Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Mashhad, Iran. The nurses were trained in the application of observational pain assessment tools by lectures or through a social networking app. Before and after the intervention, the nurses performance was evaluated in both groups using a checklist based on Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). RESULTS: In the pre-intervention phase, the nurses performance scores in the domains of pain diagnosis and pain management were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Following the intervention, the mean score of pain diagnosis was 82  19 in the lecture group and 97  8 in the social networking app group (P < 0.01), and the mean pain management scores were 30  17 and 90  18 (P < 0.01), respectively.

In this chapter, we address the question about people's preference in moving in the shared taxis to their workplaces or their reluctance and denial of the idea of moving in the shared vehicle because of the fear of getting infected. The sensitivity of the situation will compel the people to move in a single occupied vehicle (SOV). The rise in the number of vehicles on the roads will result in traffic jams and different kinds of pollution where people battling with the pandemic will inevitably get exposed to other health-related issues. We use a BPR (Bureau of Public Roads) model to combat this issue endangering the environment and public health. We exploit the BPR function to relate average travel time to the estimated number of commuters travelling by car. We collect mode share data from the NITI Ayog, the State Resource Centre and other authentic sources, which gives unique figures of the impact of shared mobility in India and how, in its absence, various sectors will get affected. Using the given data and the BPR, we evaluate increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and carpool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles and its effect on multiple other factors.

The COVID-19 pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was formerly identified in 2003. The contagiousness, dynamics of the pathogen, and mobility of the general population incurred the occurrence of underestimation of infection (i.e., the unidentified cases and the gap with the identified cases) that was potentially substantial in magnitude, which was supposed to connect with subsequent cyclical outbreaks in practice. We employed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Contained (SIR-C) mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, then asymptotically simulated the peak sizes and peak dates of the identified and unidentified cases, the underestimation, and the dynamics of the gap. The simulation outcomes indicated that unidentified peak dates in practice could predate the reported peak dates for a variable period of weeks or months. In comparison, the saturation sizes of infection remained at commensurate levels. The curve of the initial exponential-like outbreak for the undocumented cases would flatten when the gap between concurrent identified cases and unidentified cases decreased. The rate of non-pharmaceutical containment could impact the trend of disease transmission ceteris paribus, and the greater the rate the larger reduction of infections. When the rate reached a certain level of threshold, the undocumented curve would shift from flattening effect to decaying effect. A similar trend was observed when it applied to the rate of pharmaceutical containment measures ceteris paribus. The results were sensitive to the duration of infection (DOI), it manifested that greater values of DOI were associated with greater peak sizes and greater peak dates for both documented and undocumented cases. Conditional on assumptions, calibration of DOI from 8 days to 18 days would increase the unidentified peak size by nearly 56% and the peak date by almost 18 days.","output":"Modeling the underestimation of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative lung measures derived from computed tomography (CT) have been demonstrated to improve prognostication in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients, but are not part of the clinical routine since required manual segmentation of lung lesions is prohibitively time-consuming.

Utilizing the expert annotations, model training was performed 5 times with separate hold-out sets using 5-fold cross-validation to segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and automatic segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score coefficient of 0.876 $\\\\pm$ 0.005; excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes.

Short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency both appear to be strong factors leading to greater vulnerability. In addition, both sleep duration and the time of day of the vaccination seem to be associated with the magnitude of the antibody response after vaccination. Based on these findings, a recommendation would consist of a sleep duration of 7 h or more every night to both reduce the risk of infection and to optimize the efficacy of vaccination with respect to circadian timing. Improving sleep quality and its circadian timing can potentially play a role in preventing infection and in vaccination benefits.

METHODS: Researchers from three European countries defined six dimensions (four transmission determinants, two mitigation measures) to classify occupational risk. A combination of national statistics and expert judgement was used to classify ISCO-08 codes in no, low, elevated, or high risk for each dimension. Two data driven aspects of precarious work were also included and classified in four categories.

Permeability studies revealed that Hed has difficulties in crossing biological membranes, in contrast with Het, which can be considered to be well absorbed. The improved physicochemical properties influenced the biological activity in a positive manner by the increase in inhibitory activity on the DPPH radical and cholinoesterases. To conclude the use of HP--CD as a carrier in the formation of an amorphous inclusion complex seems to be a promising approach to improve the biological activity and bioavailability of Hed and Het.","output":"Amorphous Inclusion Complexes: Molecular Interactions of Hesperidin and Hesperetin with HP--CD and Their Biological Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Etiologies of acute liver failure in children can be multiple factors including virus infection, drug\\\\induced damage, and different pathogens.

This study aimed to investigate the severity, prevalence, and predictors of moral distress experienced by Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single time-point, online survey of self-identified frontline healthcare workers was conducted between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. Participants were recruited through health organisations, professional associations, or colleges, universities, government contacts, and national media. Results: 7846 complete responses were received from nurses (39.4%), doctors (31.1%), allied health staff (16.7%), or other roles (6.7%). Many participants reported moral distress related to resource scarcity (58.3%), wearing PPE (31.7%) limiting their ability to care for patients, exclusion of family going against their values (60.2%), and fear of letting co-workers down if they were infected (55.0%). Many personal and workplace predictors of moral distress were identified, with those working in certain frontline areas, metropolitan locations, and with prior mental health diagnoses at particular risk of distress. Moral distress was associated with increased risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. Conversely, feeling appreciated by the community protected against these risks in healthcare workers. Conclusions: Safeguarding healthcare workforces during crises is important for both patient safety and workforce longevity. Targeted interventions are required to prevent or minimise moral distress and associated mental health concerns in healthcare workers during COVID-19 and other crises.","output":"Moral Distress and Perceived Community Views Are Associated with Mental Health Symptoms in Frontline Health Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional ice and snow path planning methods still have internal environmental problems in intelligent path planning, such as weak innovation ability, imperfect management, long planning path, unreasonable security structure, and low degree of specialization.

Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded. Cerebral fractional tissue extraction (CFOE) was calculated as CFOE = (SaO2 - TOI)/SaO2. RESULTS In extremely preterm infants, CFOE increased modestly in the prone position in both sleep states at age 1 week, in no change in TOI despite higher SaO2. In contrast, the very preterm infants did not have position-related differences in CFOE until the fifth week of life. In the very preterm infants, TOI decreased and CFOE increased with active sleep compared with quiet sleep and with increasing postnatal age. CONCLUSION At 1 week of age, prone sleeping increased CFOE in extremely preterm infants, suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow.

The study derived from the administration of an online survey to 19,527 families with children attending schools, from nursery to upper secondary grade. The total number of student records collected amounted to 31,805, since parents had to provide data for each school-age child in the family. The survey contains 58 questions, divided into three sections, with the first two sections designed to get a reading at family level and the third section to gather data for each school-age child in the family. After verifying the validity of the engagement construct through confirmatory factor analysis, two structural equation models were used to analyze the students' engagement. The main findings reveal how the impact of the ERE on the families has had a significant role in predicting students' level of engagement observed by parents with respect to different predictor variables. Finally, we argue that it is necessary to follow a holistic approach to observe the challenges imposed by the switch of the process of deferring teaching from presence to distance, imposed by the pandemic emergency on families.

The primary endpoint was the pneumatic leakage pressure of the suture line. As a secondary endpoint, suture time was evaluated. RESULTS The median pneumatic leakage pressure for barbed sutures was 45.5 mbar (range 17-106 mbar) and 33.5 mbar (range 19-106 mbar) for monofilament sutures (p = 0.58). A pneumatic leak at a critical pressure below 25 mbar occurred in 3 cases with barbed sutures and in 7 cases with monofilament sutures (p = 0.29). Median suturing time [19:25 min:s (range 12:00-33:30) vs. 20:41 (17:00-28:33), p = 0.23] did not differ between the two groups.

Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity-using dendritic spines as proxies-of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting Arc as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express Arc have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.","output":"Hippocampal neurons with stable excitatory connectivity become part of neuronal representations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currentlya pandemic affecting the world, and there is no specific therapeutic drug available Hypoxemia is a common clinical manifestation of severe patients, and oxygen therapy is the main treatment This article reports for the first time the computed tomography (CT) imaging dynamic changes in a case of 69-year-old male with severe type of COVID-19 treated by hyperbaric oxygen, which provides a more effective regimen for severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia We emphasize that hyperbaric oxygen treatment for COVID-19 is a preliminary attempt, and more clinical studies are required to confirm its efficacy","output":"A Case Report of a Patient with Severe Type of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treated by Hyperbaric Oxygen: CT Dynamic Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Vessel diameter is the principal imaging parameter assessed clinically for aortic disease, but adverse events can occur at normal diameters. Aortic stiffness has been studied as an additional imaging-based risk factor, and has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. Reports suggest that some aortic pathology is asymmetric around the vessel circumference, a feature which would not be identified with current imaging approaches. We propose that this asymmetry may be revealed using Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE). The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of assessing asymmetric stretch in healthy and diseased ascending aortas using DENSE. METHODS Aortic wall displacement was assessed with DENSE cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in 5 volunteers and 15 consecutive patients. Analysis was performed in a cross-sectional plane through the ascending aorta at the pulmonary artery. Displacement data was used to determine the wall stretch between the expanded and resting states of the aorta, in four quadrants around the aortic circumference. RESULTS Analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not only show significant differences in stretch between groups of volunteers (p<0.001), but also significant differences in stretch along the circumference of the aorta (p<0.001), indicating an asymmetric stretch pattern. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the asymmetry between volunteers and different groups of patients (p<0.01).

METHODS Three of the most popular 3D printed respirator designs were modified to allow for OSHA quantitative fit testing which disperses saline into the ambient air and determines concentrations within the mask during multiple trials. Five volunteers conducted standardized fit tests of these masks, as well as an N95 and a KN95, and the results were compared. RESULTS One of the 3D printed respirators, Low Poly Covid-19 Face Mask Respirator (Mask 2), achieved a fit factor greater than 100 in every trial, representing sufficient fit according to OSHA protocols. The N95 mask achieved a sufficient fit in 60% of the trials, and none of the remaining masks provided a suitable fit factor reliably. Further trials showed no change in fit factor when different 3D printable plastics are used, or when a widely available HEPA filter was used.

Overcoming immune subversion is critical for developing vaccines and other measures to control this devastating swine virus. The overall goal of this work was to enhance innate and adaptive immunity following vaccination through the expression of interferon (IFN) genes by the PRRSV genome. We have constructed a series of recombinant PRRS viruses using an infectious PRRSV cDNA clone (pCMV-P129). Coding regions of exogenous genes, which included Renilla luciferase (Rluc), green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP and DsRed, respectively) and several interferons (IFNs), were constructed and expressed through a unique subgenomic mRNA placed between ORF1b and ORF2 of the PRRSV infectious clone. The constructs, which expressed Rluc, GFP, DsRed, efficiently produced progeny viruses and mimicked the parental virus in both MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages. In contrast, replication of IFN-expressing viruses was attenuated, similar to the level of replication observed after the addition of exogenous IFN. Furthermore, the IFN expressing viruses inhibited the replication of a second PRRS virus co-transfected or co-infected. Inhibition by the different IFN subtypes corresponded to their anti-PRRSV activity, i.e., IFN5  IFN1 > IFN- > IFN3. In summary, the indicator-expressing viruses provided an efficient means for real-time monitoring of viral replication thus allowing high?throughput elucidation of the role of host factors in PRRSV infection. This was shown when they were used to clearly demonstrate the involvement of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) in the early stage of PRRSV infection.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if a self-triage tool could reduce the burden on emergency call centers and help predict increasing burden on hospitals. METHODS: Users were asked questions about their underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, postal code, and main COVID-19 symptoms. Participants were advised to call an emergency call center if they reported dyspnea or complete loss of appetite for over 24 hours. Data on COVID-19-related calls were collected from 6 emergency call centers and data on COVID-19 hospitalizations were collected from Sant Publique France and the French Ministry of Health. We examined the change in the number of emergency calls before and after the launch of the web application. RESULTS: From March 17 to April 2, 2020, 735,419 questionnaires were registered in the study area. Of these, 121,370 (16.5%) led to a recommendation to call an emergency center. The peak number of overall questionnaires and of questionnaires leading to a recommendation to call an emergency center were observed on March 22, 2020. In the 17 days preceding the launch of the web application, emergency call centers in the study area registered 66,925 COVID-19-related calls and local hospitals admitted 639 patients for COVID-19; the ratio of emergency calls to hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 104.7 to 1. In the 17 days following the launch of the web application, there were 82,347 emergency calls and 6009 new hospitalizations for COVID-19, a ratio of 13.7 calls to 1 hospitalization (chi-square test: P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The self-triage web application launch was followed by a nearly 10-fold increase in COVID-19-related hospitalizations with only a 23% increase in emergency calls. The peak of questionnaire completions preceded the peak of COVID-19-related hospitalizations by 5 days.

PURPOSE: The objectives and strategies used by an ambulatory care pharmacy team operating within a large health system's pharmacy incident command structure during the initial response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are discussed. SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, a pharmacy \\"ambulatory action team\\" was formed to provide ambulatory clinical pharmacy expertise and meet an immediate and ongoing need to limit nonemergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. By building a strong communication infrastructure and partnership with ambulatory care providers, clinic medical and operational leaderships, clinical laboratory staff, and infusion centers, the team was able to swiftly execute solutions and respond to new issues and requests. Ambulatory care pharmacy practice continued to advance through provision of services to vulnerable patient populations with chronic conditions that were anticipated to experience gaps in care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts resulted in expansion of pharmacists' involvement in collaborative drug therapy management, support of patients' transition from in-clinic injection to home self-administration, provision of medication assistance support, and management of 1,300 patients via protocol-based warfarin management.

Although both SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 for host entry, distinct COVID-19 pathogenesis coincides with the acquisition of a new sequence, which is homologous to the furin cleavage site of the human epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). This review provides a comprehensive summary of the role of ACE2 in the assembly of Na(+)-dependent transporters of glucose, imino and neutral amino acids, as well as the functions of ENaC. Data support an osmotic adaptation mechanism in which osmotic and hemostatic instability induced by Ang II-activated ENaC is counterbalanced by an influx of organic osmolytes and Na(+) through the ACE2 complex. We propose a paradigm for the two-site attack of SARS-CoV-2 leading to ENaC hyperactivation and inactivation of the ACE2 complex, which collapses cell osmolality and leads to rupture and/or necrotic death of swollen pulmonary, endothelial, and cardiac cells, thrombosis in infected and non-infected tissues, and aberrant sensory and neurological perception in COVID-19 patients.

Although based on scientific evidence, international guidelines differ substantially in opinions whether GAS pharyngitis diagnosis should be based on microbiological testing, clinical algorithm or a combination of both. On the other hand, some European guidelines consider GAS pharyngitis to be a mild, self-limiting disease that does not require a specific diagnosis or antimicrobial treatment except in high-risk patients.

ELISA was used to estimate proinflammatory cytokines. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the gene and protein expression. Renal histopathological examination was also performed. IRI resulted in tissue damage, elevation of serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde, TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, up-regulation of NF-B, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. Furthermore, it up-regulated the expression of the Bax gene and down-regulated the expression of the Bcl-2 gene. Treatment of the injured rats with pantoprazole, either single dose or multiple doses, significantly alleviated IRI-induced biochemical and histopathological changes, attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, down-regulated the expression of NF-B, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins, and the Bax gene, and up-regulated Bcl-2 gene expression.

Many previous studies have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working from home affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different developers.

Creative approaches are therefore required to resolve the surging facemask waste disposal issue in an economical and environmentally friendly manner. In an attempt to resolve the evolving global waste challenge, the present study has assessed the economic and environmental performances of converting N95 facemasks to steam and electricity via a combined heat and power plant, to ethanol via a syngas fermentation process, and to an energy-dense gasoline-like oil product via a hydrothermal liquefaction process. These processes were assessed using \\"conceptual\\" process models developed using ASPEN plus as the process simulation tool. Economic and environment assessments were undertaken using net present values (NPVs) and the rate of potential environmental impacts (PEIs) respectively, as sufficient performance measures. Therefore, the present study was able to establish that the conversion of waste N95 facemask to syngas prior to a fermentation process for ethanol production constituted the least economical and least environmental friendly process with a negative NPV and the highest rate of PEI (1.59 PEI/h) value calculated. The NPV values calculated for N95 facemask waste conversion to steam and electricity and energy-dense oil processes were US$ 36.6 x 10(6) and US$ 53 x 10(6) respectively, suggesting the preference for the production of a valuable energy-dense oil product. Furthermore, it was observed that when the environmental performance of both processes was considered, rates of PEIs of 1.20 and 0.28 PEI/h were estimated for the energy-dense oil production process and the steam and electricity generation process, respectively.

It has been reported that up to 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop VTE (venous thromboembolism), and this can be as high as 31% in ICU patients with COVID-19 [2]. AIMS: To determine VTE rates in ICU patients with COVID compared to those admitted with influenza and a control group. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients admitted to ICU at our hospital. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, coagulation profile and prevalence of radiologically proven VTE were recorded and compared between groups. RESULTS: More males than females were found in each group. When groups were compared the mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar, as was the incidence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. aPTT was higher in the COVID-19 (30.9  3.7 SD) vs (12.8  4.1 SD) the influenza group vs (15.2  4.1 SD) in controls p < 0.001, but fibrinogen was lower 6.2  1.6 SD vs 34.6  14.0SD vs 30.8  5.0 SD, respectively, p < 0.001.

Although there was no statistically significant difference between the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates of the teams who performed and did not perform bronchoscopy in potential or proven COVID-19 patients in our study, the high rate of personal protective equipment utilization might have played a role in this result.","output":"Bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 counts 46 million people infected and killed more than 1.2 million. Hypoxaemia is one of the main clinical manifestations, especially in severe cases. HIF1 is a master transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxygen levels. The immunopathogenesis of this severe form of COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed scRNAseq from leukocytes from five critically ill COVID-19 patients and characterized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor1 and its transcriptionally regulated genes. Also performed metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar cells. RESULTS: Critically-ill COVID-19 patients show a shift towards an immature myeloid profile in peripheral blood cells, including band neutrophils, immature monocytes, metamyelocytes, monocyte-macrophages, monocytoid precursors, and promyelocytes-myelocytes, together with mature monocytes and segmented neutrophils. May be the result of a physiological response known as emergency myelopoiesis. These cellular subsets and bronchoalveolar cells express HIF1 and their transcriptional targets related to inflammation (CXCL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4); virus sensing, (TLR2 and TLR4); and metabolism (SLC2A3, PFKFB3, PGK1, GAPDH and SOD2). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation and participation of HIF1 in events such as inflammation, immunometabolism, and TLR make it a potential molecular marker for COVID-19 severity and, interestingly, could represent a potential target for molecular therapy. KEY MESSAGES: Critically ill COVID-19 patients show emergency myelopoiesis. HIF1 and its transcriptionally regulated genes are expressed in immature myeloid cells which could serve as molecular targets. HIF1 and its transcriptionally regulated genes is also expressed in lung cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients which may partially explain the hypoxia related events.","output":"Increased expression of hypoxia-induced factor 1 mRNA and its related genes in myeloid blood cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physician training and onsite proctoring are critical for safely introducing new biomedical devices, a process that has been disrupted by the pandemic. A teleproctoring concept using optical see-through head-mounted displays with a proctor's ability to see and, more important, virtually interact in the operator's visual field is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test conditions were created for simulated proctoring using a bifurcation aneurysm flow model for WEB device deployment. The operator in the angiography suite wore a Magic Leap-1 optical see-through head-mounted display to livestream his or her FOV to a proctor's computer in an adjacent building. A Web-based application (Spatial) was used for the proctor to virtually interact in the operator's visual space. Tested elements included the quality of the livestream, communication, and the proctor's ability to interact in the operator's environment using mixed reality. A hotspot and a Wi-Fi-based network were tested. RESULTS: The operator successfully livestreamed the angiography room environment and his FOV of the monitor to the remotely located proctor. The proctor communicated and guided the operator through the procedure over the optical see-through head-mounted displays, a process that was repeated several times. The proctor used mixed reality and virtual space sharing to successfully project images, annotations, and data in the operator's FOV for highlighting any device or procedural aspects. The livestream latency was 0.71 (SD, 0.03) seconds for Wi-Fi and 0.86 (SD, 0.3) seconds for the hotspot (P = .02). The livestream quality was subjectively better over the Wi-Fi. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies using head-mounted displays and virtual space sharing could offer solutions applicable to remote proctoring in the neurointerventional space.","output":"Teleproctoring for Neurovascular Procedures: Demonstration of Concept Using Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display, Interactive Mixed Reality, and Virtual Space Sharing-A Critical Need Highlighted by the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient safety is the core goal of medical institutions. The present study focuses on the patient safety culture and staff well-being admit the COVID-19 pandemic. In a large metropolitan hospital group, 337 employees who had participated in the quality improvement interventions completed an anonymous questionnaire of patient safety culture and personal well-being. The multiple regression analyses indicated that managerial role, seniority, female gender and direct contact with a patient were significantly related to the positive attitude on overall or certain dimensions of safety culture. Multivariate analysis also found that dimensions of teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction and stress recognition as patient safety culture predicted staff exhaustion. Finally, comparing with the available institutional historic data in 2018, the COVID group scored higher on the working condition dimension of patient safety culture, but lower on the stress recognition dimension. The COVID group also scored higher on exhaustion. In the post-pandemic era, there seems to be an improvement on certain aspect of the patient safety culture among hospital staff, and the improvement is more prevalent for managers. However, exhaustion is also a poignant problem for all employees. These findings can inform hospital decision-makers in planning and implementing future improvements of patient safety culture and promoting employee well-being and resilience.

Fifty-eight cytologic preps (20 oral and 38 from the nasopharynx) were obtained from ten patients and analyzed in a blinded fashion for SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope protein by immunohistochemistry and viral RNA by in situ hybridization. qRTPCR identified three positive cases and seven controls; the three cases reported mild symptoms that resolved in 2C3 days. Blinded analyses confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins and viral RNA in the three cases and viral absence in the seven controls. A signal for the positive cases was evident in each nasopharyngeal and none of the oral samples. Viral RNA/proteins localized exclusively to glandular cells and was present in high copy number. Blinded analysis of the cytology documented that the glandular cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed marked degeneration with ciliocytophthoria; viral inclusions were not evident. Co-expression analysis showed viral infected cells had increased apoptosis, marked by strong expression of activated caspase 3. Weekly serial testing of two of the cases showed persistence of productive viral infection for up to 2 weeks after symptom onset. It is concluded that the target cell of SARS-CoV-2 in the head and neck region is the glandular cell of the nasal passages, that viral infection is lytic and associated with high copy number that facilitates viral spread.

Examples of EIDs include COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease. EIDs are known for their complexity. Multiple factors play a role in their spread, including increases in human population, conflicts, urbanisation, air travel, global trade and inequalities in wealth distribution and access to healthcare. In order to gain a better understanding of such complexity, we aim to explore the role of systems science, which allows us to view EIDs in the context of complex adaptive systems rather than simple causes and effects. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore and map the theoretical concepts and key characteristics of studies that use systems methods in controlling EIDs, to identify the gaps in knowledge and disseminate the results. METHODS: We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for this scoping review, comprising the following stages: formulating the research question and subquestions, scanning the literature for available data, selecting relevant publications, charting the data by two independent reviewers, aggregating the findings, reporting, summarising and disseminating the results. We will review peer-reviewed articles, preprints and grey literature available in all languages. DISCUSSION: We intend that this scoping review will contribute to a better understanding of the use of systems methods to inform policymakers about how to prevent and control EIDs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for a scoping review because it is based on reviewing and collecting data from publicly available sources. To disseminate the findings, results will be shared through academic publications, seminars and conferences.","output":"Role of systems science in preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases: protocol for a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas responsible for climate change Diatoms, a natural sink of atmospheric CO2, can be cultivated industrially in autotrophic and mixotrophic modes for the purpose of CO2 sequestration In addition, the metabolic diversity exhibited by this group of photosynthetic organisms provides avenues to redirect the captured carbon into products of value These include lipids, omega-3 fatty acids, pigments, antioxidants, exopolysaccharides, sulphated polysaccharides, and other valuable metabolites that can be produced in environmentally sustainable bio-manufacturing processes To realize the potential of diatoms, expansion of our knowledge of carbon supply, CO2 uptake and fixation by these organisms, in conjunction with ways to enhance metabolic routing of the fixed carbon to products of value is required In this review, current knowledge is explored, with an evaluation of the potential of diatoms for carbon capture and bio-based manufacturing","output":"Diatoms for Carbon Sequestration and Bio-Based Manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differences in gendered knowledge about plants are contingent on specific cultural domains. Yet the boundaries between these domains, for example food and medicine, are sometimes blurred, and it is unclear if and how gender plays a role in creating a continuum between them. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of the links between gender, medicinal plant knowledge, and culinary culture in Marrakech, Morocco. We interviewed 30 women and 27 men with different socio-demographic characteristics and evaluated how gender and cooking frequency shape their food and medicinal plant knowledge. We documented 171 ethno-taxa used in Marrakshi households as food, medicine, or both, corresponding to 148 botanical taxa and three mixtures. While no clear differences appear in food plant knowledge by gender, women have a three-fold greater knowledge of medicinal plants, as well as plants with both uses as food and medicine. Womens medicinal and food plant knowledge increases with their reported frequency of cooking, whereas the opposite trend is observed among men. Men who cook more are often single, have university-level degrees, and may be isolated from the channels of knowledge transmission. This demonstrates that the profound relations between the culinary and health domains are mediated through gender.","output":"Medicines in the Kitchen: Gender Roles Shape Ethnobotanical Knowledge in Marrakshi Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents experimental evidence for the over-specification of small cardinalities in referential communication. The first experiment shows that when presented with a small set (2, 3, or 4) of unique objects, the speaker includes a numeral denoting a small cardinality into the description of given objects, although it is over-informative for the hearer (e.g., three stars). On the contrary, when presented with a large set of unique objects, the speaker does not include a numeral denoting a large cardinality into their description, so she produces a bare plural (e.g., stars). The effect of small cardinalities resembles the effect of over-specifying color in referential communication, which has been extensively studied in recent years (cf. Tarenskeen et al., 2015; Rubio-Fernndez, 2016, among many others). This suggests that, like color, small cardinalities are absolute and salient. The second experiment demonstrates that when presented with an identical small set of monochrome objects, the speaker over-specifies a small cardinality to a much greater extent than a color. This suggests that small cardinalities are even more salient than color. The third experiment reveals that when slides are flashed on the screen one by one, highlighted objects of small cardinalities are still over-specified. We argue that a plausible explanation for the salience of small cardinalities is a subitizing effect, which is the human capacity to instantaneously grasp small cardinalities.","output":"Over-Specification of Small Cardinalities in Referential Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The provisory data collected by the tuberculosis (TB) Program in 2020 show that the global incidence decreases by 30%, but considering the long interval from infection to the appearance of clinical manifestations in TB, we will be able to analyse only in the following years the positive or negative impact of the restrictive measures imposed as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the evolution of TB in Romania. ? 2020 Ioana Munteanu et al., published by Sciendo 2020.","output":"TB endemic evolution in Romania in the shadow of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) is a crucial medicinal herb as it accumulates glycyrrhizin and liquiritin in roots. Licorice root-associated bacterial communities shaped by soil characteristics are supposed to regulate the accumulation of root secondary metabolites. METHODS: The soil characteristics, root secondary metabolites, and root-associated bacterial communities were analyzed in licorice plants of different ages to explore their temporal dynamics and interaction mechanisms. RESULTS: Temporal variation in soil characteristics and root secondary metabolites was distinct. The alpha-diversity of root-associated bacterial communities decreased with root proximity, and the community composition was clustered in the rhizosphere. Different taxa that were core-enriched from the dominant taxa in the bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere displayed varied timeCdecay relationships. Soil total potassium (TK) as a key factor regulated the temporal variation in some individual taxa in the bulk and rhizosphere soils; these taxa were associated with the adjustment of root secondary metabolites across different TK levels. CONCLUSIONS: Licorice specifically selects root-associated core bacteria over the course of plant development, and TK is correlated with root secondary metabolites and individual core-enriched taxa in the bulk and rhizosphere soils, which may have implications for practical licorice cultivation.

The impact of the pandemic on dual-physician households remains unknown. In this survey study, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dual-physician families and described gendered differences related to the impact of the pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey distributed via e-mail and social media, with results collected from April 30, 2020 until May 26, 2020. Respondents were members of a dual-physician couple. Respondents provided information on demographic characteristics and the impact of the pandemic on their professional lives, personal lives, and well-being. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Ordinal variables were compared between genders using Cochran-Armitage trend test. Feeling emotionally and physically drained compared to pre-pandemic was analyzed as a binary outcome in a multivariable logistic model. Results: Of the 1799 physicians who completed the survey, 52% were between 30 and 39 years old, 81% self-identified as women, and 62% were white. Women were more likely to report increased worry about their job security, finances, personal health, partner's health, and children's health (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively).

Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. Methods We did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085. Findings Between June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group. Interpretation The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

A mature strong immunity coupled with gut dysbiosis in adults is the main cause of nutritional disorders like morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Nutrition disorders in return worsen dysbiosis. Human microbiome has an intrinsic duality. While a diverse microbiome provides a full spectrum of essential nutrients to our body, nutrition disorders fuel overgrowth of microbiota (dysbiosis) at many sites on or inside our body, and are the main causes of chronic inflammation at these sites. In the case of COVID-19, nutritional disorder impairs the immunity, causes hyperinflammation, and leads to the protracted overload of cytokines by the immune system, i.e., the cytokine storm. Autophagy induced by restrictive eating is an ideal inhibitor of microbiota overgrowth, as autophagy deprives microbiota of excessive nutrition for replication. Autophagy also attenuates inflammation.

Now, MAs are foundational to team-based care, interacting with patients, systems, and teams in many ways. The transition to Virtual Health during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a further rapid and unique shift of MA roles and responsibilities. We sought to understand the impact of this shift and to place their new roles in the context of national professional competency standards. METHODS: In this qualitative, grounded theory study we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 MAs at 10 primary care sites at a major academic medical center on their experiences during the shift from in-person to virtual care. MAs were selected by convenience sample. Coding was done in Dedoose version 8.335. Consensus-based inductive and deductive approaches were used for interview analysis. Identified MA roles were compared to national MA, Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competency domains. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: Role Apprehension, Role Expansion, and Adaptability/Professionalism. Nine key roles emerged in the context of virtual visits: direct patient care (pre-visit and physical care), panel management, health systems ambassador, care coordination, patient flow coordination, scribing, quality improvement, and technology support. While some prior MA roles were limited by the virtual care shift, the majority translated directly or expanded in virtual care. Identified roles aligned better with Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competencies, than current national MA curricula. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to Virtual Health decreased MAs direct clinical work and expanded other roles within interprofessional care, notably quality improvement and technology support. Comparison of the current MA roles with national training program competencies identified new leadership and teamwork competencies which could be expanded during MA training to better support MA roles on inter-professional teams.","output":"Transforming Interprofessional Roles During Virtual Health Care: The Evolving Role of the Medical Assistant, in Relationship to National Health Profession Competency Standards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Authentic data does not portray falsehood;however, its integrity can be tempered through manipulation for various reasons.

Nearly 800 000 people around the world lose their life to suicide every year, and many more attempt suicide. METHODS A decomposition analysis was performed using global suicide mortality and population data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. RESULTS Despite a significant decrease in age-specific suicide rate between 1990 and 2019 (-4.01; from 13.8% to 9.8% per 100 000), the overall numbers of suicide deaths increased by 19 897 (from 738 799 to 758 696) in the same time period. The reductions in age-specific suicide rates (-6.09; 152%) contributed to the overall reductions in suicide rates; however, this was offset by overtime changes in population age structure (2.08; -52%). The increase in suicide numbers was partly attributable to population growth (300 942; 1512.5%) and population age structure (189 512; 952.4%), which was attenuated by the significant reduction in overall suicide rates (-470 556; 2364.9%). The combined effect of these factors varied across the World Bank income level regions. For example, in the upper-middle-income level region, the effect of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-289 731; -1456.1%) exceeded the effect of population age structure (124 577; 626.1%) and population growth (83 855; 421.4%), resulting in its substantial decline in total suicide deaths (-81 298; -408.6%). However, in lower-middle income region, there was a notable increase in suicide death (72 550; 364.6%), which was related to the net gain of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-115 577; -580.9%) and negated by the increase in the number of suicide deaths due to population growth (152 093; 764.4%) and population age structure (36 034; 181.1%). CONCLUSION More support and resources should be deployed for suicide prevention to the low-income and middle-income regions in order to achieve the reduction goal. Moreover, suicide prevention among older adults is increasingly critical given the world's rapidly ageing populations in all income level regions.","output":"Demographic and epidemiological decomposition analysis of global changes in suicide rates and numbers over the period 1990-2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers the role that the law of international responsibility, both State responsibility and responsibility of international organizations, plays in claims and disputes about covid-19 It proceeds by examining in turn the rubrics of the internationally wrongful act, content of responsibility, and implementation of responsibility On most points, blackletter law is perfectly capable of answering the questions raised by claims related to covid-19 But evolutionary potential inherent in the normal international legal process should also be recognised, whether it manifests itself by further strengthening current rules, elaborating vague rules by application, filling gaps in current law by generating new practice or even, exceptionally, revisiting rules currently in force ? koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020","output":"Covid-19 claims and the law of international responsibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomics-based neoantigen discovery can be enhanced by proteomic evidence, but there remains a lack of consensus on the performance of different quality control methods for variant peptide identification in proteogenomics.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3,7,8 and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing proinflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study is hoped to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in-silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7 respectively and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is a maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and could serve as useful targets for the conception of therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.

Self-developed questionnaires were used to measure changes in nocturnal sleep, daytime napping, lifestyles and negative emotions in individuals before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine hundred and thirty effective questionnaires were collected in this study. Repeated measures analysis of variance and hierarchical regression analysis were applied. We found that individuals' sleep rhythms were delayed, and sleep duration and sleep latency were increased during the stay-at-home orders. Meanwhile, their exercise levels and learning/working efficiency were decreased, and electronic device use time, annoyance levels and anxiety levels were increased. Delayed sleep patterns affected lifestyles and emotions. Moreover, sleep quality positively predicted learning/working efficiency and exercise levels, and negatively predicted use of electronic devices and negative emotions. Sleep patterns became delayed on weekdays during stay-at-home orders in all four daytime napping groups (no daytime napping, daytime napping as before, more daytime napping and less daytime napping), and the group taking daytime naps as before had a minimal variation, and their lifestyles and emotions were significantly better than those of the other groups. This study demonstrated that under the influence of stress caused by the pandemic, maintaining regular daytime napping was an effective way to stabilize sleep patterns and biological rhythms, keep good lifestyles and alleviate the effect of acute psychological stress, and to prevent and control mental disorders during the pandemic.","output":"Maintaining normal sleep patterns, lifestyles and emotion during the COVID-19 pandemic: The stabilizing effect of daytime napping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout 2021, the medical and scientific communities have focused on managing the acute morbidity and mortality caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the lockdown on March 8, 2020. METHODS: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (N = 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (N = 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (N = 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21. According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9C15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (p < 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.0001).

The study employed data from an internet survey about the impact of COVID-19 on LGBTQ+ identified individuals conducted between May and July 2020. The final sample was comprised of 1090 participants from across the USA. Overall, sexual activity and the number of sexual partners decreased after March 13, 2020 (as compared to before this date) across all sexual orientation groups; however, living situation and partnership status supported sexual activity. Gay and bisexual men living with a partner or a spouse (AOR = 2.20, p = .023) and those living with a non-romantic roommate or friend (AOR = 2.88, p = .004) reported more sexual activity.

Despite the significance of bill-to-bill linkages for understanding the legislative process, existing approaches fail to address semantic similarities across bills, let alone reordering or paraphrasing which are prevalent in legal document writing. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a 5-class classification task that closely reflects the nature of the bill generation process. In doing so, we construct a human-labeled dataset of 4,721 bill-to-bill relationships at the subsection-level and release this annotated dataset to the research community. To augment the dataset, we generate synthetic data with varying degrees of similarity, mimicking the complex bill writing process. We use BERT variants and apply multi-stage training, sequentially fine-tuning our models with synthetic and human-labeled datasets.

Chinese government has emphasized the importance of reducing carbon emissions and set the target of reducing carbon intensity to 60C65% of 2005 levels by 2030. Investigating the convergence of carbon intensity can identify the convergence rate, which is helpful in guiding allocations of carbon intensity reduction. The Yangtze River Delta is one of the key carbon emission regions in China, with higher urbanization levels and larger carbon emissions; thus, we employed prefecture-level panel data derived from grid data between 2000 and 2010 to examine whether the convergence of carbon intensity exists across prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Spatial panel data models were utilized to investigate -convergence of carbon intensity. The results indicated that carbon intensity showed divergence during 2002C2004 and -convergence over other periods (2000C2002 and 2004C2010). Carbon intensity exhibited stochastic convergence, indicating that the shocks to carbon intensity relative to the average level of carbon intensity are only transitory. There was a spatial spillover effect and -convergence of carbon intensity, suggesting that prefecture-level cities with higher carbon intensity would decrease rapidly in the Yangtze River Delta. Our results highlight the importance of considering the present state of carbon intensity, spatial factors, and socioeconomic factors such as industrial structure and economic levels during allocation planning for reducing carbon intensity.","output":"Convergence of carbon intensity in the Yangtze River Delta, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is having a global impact unseen since the 1918 worldwide influenza epidemic.

Launched as part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (Act-A) in June 2020, COVAX suggested to serve as a vaccine buyers and distribution club for countries around the world. It also aimed to support the pharmaceutical industry in speeding up and broadening vaccine development. While COVAX has recently come under critique for failing to bring about global vaccine equity, influential politicians and public health advocates insist that future iterations of it will improve pandemic preparedness. So far COVAXs role in the ongoing financialization of global health, i.e. in the rise of financial concepts, motives, practices and institutions has not been analyzed. METHODS: This article describes and critically assesses COVAXs financial logics, i.e. the concepts, arguments and financing flows on which COVAX relies. It is based on a review of over 109 COVAX related reports, ten in-depth interviews with global health experts working either in or with COVAX, as well as participant observation in 18 webinars and online meetings concerned with global pandemic financing, between September 2020 and August 2021. RESULTS: The article finds that COVAX expands the scale and scope of financial instruments in global health governance, and that this is done by conflating different understandings of risk. Specifically, COVAX conflates public health risk and corporate financial risk, leading it to privilege concerns of pharmaceutical companies over those of most participating countries C especially low and lower-middle income countries (LICs and LMICs). COVAX thus drives the financialization of global health and ends up constituting a risk itself - that of perpetuating the downsides of financialization (e.g. heightened inequality, secrecy, complexity in governance, an ineffective and slow use of aid), whilst insufficiently realising its potential benefits (pandemic risk reduction, increased public access to emergency funding, indirect price control over essential goods and services). CONCLUSION: Future iterations of vaccine buyers and distribution clubs as well as public vaccine development efforts should work towards reducing all aspects of public health risk rather than privileging its corporate financial aspects. This will include reassessing the interplay of aid and corporate subsidies in global health.","output":"Risky business: COVAX and the financialization of global vaccine equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity in Australia is on the rise, yet it remains a serious and underappreciated policy issue. The demand for and expansion of food banks, community agencies, and school breakfast programmes in Australia has led to the emergency food relief system being referred to as an industry in itself. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated financial crisis, have only exacerbated the challenge of putting food onto the table. These unprecedented challenges expose the vulnerabilities of addressing the problem of food insecurity solely through a charity-based approach. Through key case studies of innovative local food governance models across the globe, this paper calls attention to the need to break down the disconnected, siloed, and fragmented policies and responses across public and private spheres in order to design more comprehensive interventions that better address the complex reality of food insecurity in Australia.

Currently, this virus has spread around the world, and new variants have emerged. This new pandemic virus provoked the rapid development of diagnostic tools, therapies and vaccines to control this new disease called COVID\\\\19. Antibody detection by ELISA has been broadly used to recognize the number of persons infected with this virus or to evaluate the response of vaccinated individuals. As the pandemic spread, new questions arose, such as the prevalence of antibodies after natural infection and the response induced by the different vaccines. In Mexico, as in other countries, mRNA and viral\\\\vectored vaccines have been widely used among the population. In this work, we developed an indirect ELISA test to evaluate S1 antibodies in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. By using this test, we showed that IgG antibodies against the S1 protein of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 were detected up to 42 weeks after the onset of the symptoms, in contrast to IgA and IgM, which decreased 14 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of the antibody response in individuals vaccinated with Pfizer\\\\BioNTech and CanSinoBio vaccines showed no differences 2 weeks after vaccination. However, after completing the two doses of Pfizer\\\\BioNTech and the one dose of CanSinoBio, a significantly higher response of IgG antibodies was observed in persons vaccinated with Pfizer\\\\BioNTech than in those vaccinated with CanSinoBio. In conclusion, these results confirm that after natural infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, it is possible to detect antibodies for up to 10 months. Additionally, our results showed that one dose of the CanSinoBio vaccine induces a lower response of IgG antibodies than that induced by the complete scheme of the Pfizer\\\\BioNTech vaccine.","output":"Analysis of IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein S1 in convalescent and vaccinated patients with the Pfizer\\\\BioNTech and CanSinoBio vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantifying feeding behaviour of generalist predators at the population and individual levels is crucial for understanding the structure and functioning of food webs. Individual predator/consumer feeding niches can be significantly narrower than that of the population across animal taxa. In such species, the population of a generalist predator becomes essentially an ensemble of specialist individuals and this often highly affects the dynamics of the prey-predator interactions. Currently, few experimental systems exist that are both easily technically manipulated in a lab and are reliable to accurately assess effects of individual specialisation within generalist predators. Here we argue that a freshwater predaceous snail, Anentome helena (also known as an 'assassin snail'), is a convenient and reliable experimental system to study feeding of a generalist predator on multiple food types which exhibits well-pronounced specialisation of foraging individuals. Using A. helena we experimentally test: (i) how relative prey abundances in the environment affect the feeding patterns, (ii) whether the feeding patterns are consistent over the duration of the experimental period, and (iii) compare the feeding niche breadth of individuals to that of the laboratory population. By offering four different prey snail species, at a range of relative abundances, we show that there are consistent patterns in feeding. Importantly, the consumption of each prey was independent of the relative abundance at which they were present. Individual predators showed selectivity to a particular prey, i.e. the population of assassin snails seems to be formed of individuals that specialise on different prey. Our findings would contribute to the recent revision and the ongoing debate on the classification of predator species into generalists and specialists.","output":"Assassin snails (Anentome helena) as a biological model for exploring the effects of individual specialisation within generalist predators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody therapies such as convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies have emerged as major potential therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunoglobulins differ from conventional antimicrobial agents in that they mediate direct and indirect antimicrobial effects that work in concert with other components of the immune system. The field of infectious diseases pioneered antibody therapies in the first half of the 20th century but largely abandoned them with the arrival of conventional antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, much of the knowledge gained from the historical development and use of immunoglobulins such as serum and convalescent antibody therapies was forgotten; principles and practice governing their use were not taught to new generations of medical practitioners, and further development of this modality stalled. This became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 when convalescent plasma was initially deployed as salvage therapy in patients with severe disease. In retrospect, this was a stage of disease when it was less likely to be effective. Lessons of the past tell us that antibody therapy is most likely to be effective when used early in respiratory diseases. This article puts forth three principles of antibody therapy, namely, specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles, connoting that antibody efficacy requires the administration of specific antibody, given early in course of disease in sufficient amount. These principles are traced to the history of serum therapy for infectious diseases. The application of the specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles to COVID-19 is discussed in the context of current use of antibody therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","output":"The Principles of Antibody Therapy for Infectious Diseases with Relevance for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractA central challenge in ecology and evolutionary biology is to understand how variation in abiotic and biotic factors combine to shape the distribution, abundance, and diversity of focal species. Environmental gradients, whether natural (e.g., latitude, elevation, ocean proximity) or anthropogenic (e.g., land-use intensity, urbanization), provide compelling settings for addressing this challenge. However, not all organisms are amenable to the observational and experimental approaches required for untangling the factors that structure species along gradients. Here we highlight herbaceous plants in the genus Plantago as models for studying the ecology and evolution of species interactions along abiotic gradients. Plantago lanceolata and P. major are native to Europe and Asia but distributed globally, and they are established models for studying population ecology and interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and soil microbes. Studying restricted range congeners in comparison with those cosmopolitan species can provide insight into abiotic and biotic determinants of range size and population structure. We highlight one such species, P. rugelii, which is endemic to eastern North America. We give an overview of the literature on these focal Plantago species and explain why they are logical candidates for studies of species interactions across environmental gradients. Finally, we emphasize collaborative and community science approaches that can facilitate such research and note the amenability of Plantago for authentic research projects in science education.","output":"Plantago spp. as Models for Studying the Ecology and Evolution of Species Interactions across Environmental Gradients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence in the 1990s, White Spot Disease (WSD) has had major economic and societal impact in the crustacean aquaculture sector. Over the years shrimp farming alone has experienced billion dollar losses through WSD. The disease is caused by the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a large dsDNA virus and the only member of the Nimaviridae family. Susceptibility to WSSV in a wide range of crustacean hosts makes it a major risk factor in the translocation of live animals and in commodity products. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Understanding the molecular basis of disease processes has contributed significantly to the treatment of many human and animal pathogens, and with a similar aim considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding hostCpathogen molecular interactions for WSD. Work on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in aquatic crustaceans has been restricted by a lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for host species. Nevertheless, some of the key hostCpathogen interactions have been established: between viral envelope proteins and host cell receptors at initiation of infection, involvement of various immune system pathways in response to WSSV, and the roles of various host and virus miRNAs in mitigation or progression of disease. Despite these advances, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain; for example, the roles of the majority of WSSV proteins are still unknown. In this review we assess current knowledge of how WSSV infects and replicates in its host, and critique strategies for WSD treatment.","output":"Molecular Mechanisms of White Spot Syndrome Virus Infection and Perspectives on Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organ transplantation from living related donors in Bangladesh first began in October 1982, and became commonplace in 1988. Cornea transplantation from posthumous donors began in 1984 and living related liver and bone marrow donor transplantation began in 2010 and 2014 respectively. The Human Organ Transplantation Act officially came into effect in Bangladesh on 13th April 1999, allowing organ donation from both brain-dead and related living donors for transplantation. Before the legislation, religious leaders issued fatwa, or religious rulings, in favor of organ transplantation. The Act was amended by the Parliament on 8th January, 2018 with the changes coming into effect shortly afterwards on 28th January. However, aside from a few posthumous corneal donations, transplantation of vital organs, such as the kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, and other body parts or organs from deceased donors, has remained absent in Bangladesh. The major question addressed in this article is why the transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is absent in Bangladesh. In addition to the collection of secondary documents, interviews were conducted with senior transplant physicians, patients and their relatives, and the public, to learn about posthumous organ donation for transplantation. Interviews were also conducted with a medical student and two grief counselors to understand the process of counseling the families and obtaining consent to obtain posthumous cornea donations from brain-dead patients. An interview was conducted with a professional anatomist to understand the processes behind body donation for the purposes of medical study and research. Their narrative reveals that transplant physicians may be reticent to declare brain death as the stipulations of the 1999 act were unclear and vague. This study finds that Bangladeshis have strong family ties and experience anxiety around permitting separating body parts of dead relatives for organ donation for transplantation, or donating the dead body for medical study and research purposes. Posthumous organ donation for transplantation is commonly viewed as a wrong deed from a religious point of view. Religious scholars who have been consulted by the government have approved posthumous organ donation for transplantation on the grounds of necessity to save lives even though violating the human body is generally forbidden in Islam. An assessment of the dynamics of biomedicine, religion and culture leads to the conclusion that barriers to posthumous organ donation for transplantation that are perceived to be religious may actually stem from cultural attitudes. The interplay of faith, belief, religion, social norms, rituals and wider cultural attitudes with biomedicine and posthumous organ donation and transplantation is very complex. Although overcoming the barriers to organ donation for transplantation is challenging, initiation of transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is necessary within Bangladesh. This will ensure improved healthcare outcomes, prevent poor people from being coerced into selling their organs to rich recipients, and protect the solidarity and progeny of Bangladeshi families.","output":"Deceased Organ Transplantation in Bangladesh: The Dynamics of Bioethics, Religion and Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Year 2020 has brought the greatest global pandemic to hit the world since the end of the First World War.

They received standard therapy along with pulses of methylprednisolone (group 1) or methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab (group 2), with the possibility of receiving anakinra (group 3) according to protocol. The aim of this study was to assess the role of anakinra in the clinical course (death, admission to the intensive care ward) during the first 60 days after the first corticosteroid pulse. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics as well as infectious complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: 74 patients (51.7%) in group 1, 59 (41.3%) patients in group 2, and 10 patients (7%) in group 3 were included. 8 patients (10.8%) in group 1 died, 6 (10.2%) in group 2, and 0 (0%) in group 3.

The Dastatuz project aims to study children food neophobia and to enhance fruit and vegetable acceptance. METHODS A quasi-experimental, multicentre, controlled and prospective intervention study is proposed, in which early factors influencing new food acceptance will be studied. Mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy (n = 144) and their infants will be the study population. Experimental groups will be established based on mothers fruit and vegetable intake (standard or high intake) and weaning method (baby lead weaning vs spoon feeding). The project will assess the possible impact of maternal diet and complementary feeding on infants eating behaviour until 18 months of age. Outcome measures will comprise maternal diet and psychological features during pregnancy and breast-feeding (validated questionnaires). Compositional and physicochemical analysis of milk during breastfeeding will also be carried out. During weaning, until 18 months of age, children's diet will be assessed with 24 h recalls and acceptance of new fruits and vegetables will be studied using video recording.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, EMRs from 82 healthcare facilities in the Cerner COVID-19 Datamart were analyzed. The study comprised 38 106 individuals aged 18-45 years old with COVID-19 who had emergency department, urgent care, or inpatient encounters from December 2019 to September 2020. Subgroups were balanced through propensity score weights for age, race, smoking status, and number of comorbidities. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related mortality; secondary outcomes were markers of severe COVID-19: intubations, mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, diagnosis of sepsis, and diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. RESULTS: In comparing pregnant and nonpregnant women, no statistical differences were found for markers of severe COVID-19, after adjusting for age, smoking, race, and comorbidities.

Eighty percent of patients had electroencephalograms that showed a diffuse slow wave. Twenty-eight (87.5%) patients were administered with specific treatment. The majority (65.63%) of patients improved following systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: Encephalitis/meningitis is the common neurological complication in patients with COVID-19. The appropriate use of definitions and exclusion of potential similar diseases are important to reduce over-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 associated encephalitis or meningitis.","output":"Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis and meningitis amid COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute pain is common in children and young adults with cancer and sickle cell disease. Current training curricula fail to adequately impart skills for pain management. We sought to develop and validate an education and assessment tool to address the safe effective use of opioids for pain management by pediatrics trainees. METHODS The first version of the tool contained 10 case-based, multiple-choice questions. It was pilot tested within a medium-sized pediatric residency program using preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess residents' knowledge and comfort related to prescribing opioids. Content validation was performed through an expert panel of physicians. Internal reliability was tested by administering the tool to learners and practitioners with varying levels of training. RESULTS Comfort with choosing and converting between opioids increased significantly in pilot testing (P=0.005). Mean objective knowledge scores increased from 51% to 85.9% (P<0.001). The revised tool showed internal reliability within each group (Cronbach alpha 0.71 to 0.78) and significant differences in mean scores between groups (F ratio=9.45, P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS This tool demonstrates validity and internal reliability. Its use was associated with short-term educational gains and it garnered overall favorable feedback from users.

Teachers' endeavours to conduct their courses online, the support they take during their endeavours, and their relationships with such basic components as the environment, content and students during this adaptation process will be revealed within the framework of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Design/methodology/approach In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed. The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020-21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed ( Creswell, 2009). The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020-21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. Findings The ICT teachers' adaptations to the online courses have developed positively over the sub-dimensions of UTAUT, which are performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SE), facilitating conditions (FC) and behavioural intention (BI). The ICT teachers' adaptations to the online instruction process have a significant effect on PE, FC and BI on the basis of gender, and on PE and EE on the basis of course content quality. In the process whereby the ICT teachers carry out the ITS course online, the sub-dimensions of PE, SE and FC are significantly predictive of the BI. Research limitations/implications UTAUT has been taken as a guiding framework in explaining and discussing the adaptations. Similarly, in other studies focussing on adaptation, this model could be employed in planning the research process. In addition, this study has followed a method in which qualitative data are mostly used to explain the quantitative data. Further studies may adopt a process whereby qualitative data are largely used to describe the way ITS course is conducted in online environments and this process may be used to develop a model. Practical implications Examining the students' BIs in online courses overlaps with the sub-dimension of PE in this study, which stresses that PE, EE and motivation are significantly and directly effective on the students' intentions of using the online courses, while there is a difference between these two studies in terms of the dimension of EE. The factors such learning outcome, curriculum, attendance to the course, use of materials and tools, interaction and technological substructure appear to be affected by this dimension, so they could be taken as important in that they reveal the importance of the study. Originality/value This study may provide clues for the online instruction practices that it reveals teachers' adaptations to online learning environments at secondary schools. On the other hand, software, hardware, coding and robotics take place in the subjects like product designing, developing and programming that are within the content of ITS course for secondary schools. Even though there is a curriculum prepared for these subjects, a lot of different instruction techniques can be used for the teaching of these subjects. This can allow some inferences about the environments and methods suitable for the online instruction of the related subjects.","output":"ICT teachers' adaptations to online instruction during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TRIANNI mice carry an entire set of human immunoglobulin V region gene segments and are a powerful tool to rapidly generate human monoclonal antibodies. After immunizing these mice against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we identified 29 hybridoma antibodies that reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Nine antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection at IC50 values in the subnanomolar range. ELISA-binding studies and DNA sequence analyses revealed one cluster of clonally related neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain and compete with the cellular receptor hACE2. A second cluster of neutralizing antibodies binds to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein without competing with the binding of hACE2 or cluster 1 antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 mutants selected for resistance to an antibody from one cluster are still neutralized by an antibody from the other cluster. Antibodies from both clusters markedly reduced viral spread in mice transgenic for human ACE2 and protected the animals from SARS-CoV-2 induced weight loss. Thus, we report two clusters of potent non-competing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies providing potential candidates for therapy and prophylaxis of COVID-19.

Being at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, Health Care Workers (HCWs) are among the greatest groups at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is very important to study the risk and sources of infection and clinical outcome of HCWs. Aim: To study the clinico-epidemiological profile and outcome of COVID-19 positive HCWs in Government Medical College Thrissur, Kerala, India. Materials and Methods: This was a hospital based cross-sectional study conducted during the time period from February 2020 to December 2020. A semi-structured telephonic interview schedule and hospital based records were used to collect the demographic, epidemiological and clinical information of 235 COVID-19 positive HCWs. Proportions along with 95% Confidence Interval was used to express the results. Results: Among 235 COVID-19 positive HCWs, 51% were either nurses or auxiliary nursing staff. Non-COVID-19 areas had 31.9% infections, while 17.1% of infections occured in COVID-19 areas. Around 57% acquired infection from health care settings. Common symptoms were fever (67.2%), myalgia (40.4%) and headache (39.6%). Around 21.3% subjects remained asymptomatic. Hand hygiene compliance was 96.6%. Among positive HCWs, 57% used N95 mask, 52.8% used gloves, 49.8% used apron and 48.9% used face shield in the hospital. Only 0.85% required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. No mortality was reported in the present study. Conclusion: There is a considerable risk for COVID-19 infection among HCWs in hospital settings especially from non-COVID-19 areas. Present study findings show the risk of exposure and need of infection control measures even outside the health care settings. Early identification and isolation of cases is very important. This study will be useful for policy makers in planning control strategies and preventing COVID-19 infections among HCWs.","output":"Original article clinicoepidemiological profile and outcome of COVID-19 positive health care workers in a tertiary care centre in south India microbiology section"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Events that occur during fetal and perinatal life can have consequences on the health and disease of the offspring. The pioneering work on the \\"Fetal Programming Hypothesis\\" focused on pregnant women exposed to a great famine that occurred in the Netherlands at the end of World War II. The intrauterine environment of the babies during that famine caused them to low birthweight and determined the appearance of cardiovascular diseases in themselves when they reached adulthood, a risk that was transmitted even to the following generation. In addition to the general stress that a pregnant woman may suffer as a result of the death of a family member, suffering a war or natural disaster such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is another specific type of stress that refers exclusively to the pregnancy process; this is the pregnancy specific-stress. Pregnancy-specific stress is capable of sensitively predicting negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. This type of stress refers to the specific stress of pregnant women related to medical problems, the health of the newborn, the changes that the pregnancy will produce in their social relationships, prematurity, physical changes of pregnancy and fear of labor and birth. The objective of this article was to offer an updated information on pregnancy-specific stress and its consequences for maternal and neonatal health.

Sox10 specifies pigment cell, glial, and neuronal lineages, whereas Sox9 is reportedly closely associated with skeletogenic lineages in the head, but its involvement in pigment cell formation has not been investigated genetically. Thus, it is not fully understood whether or how distinctly these genes as well as their paralogs in teleosts are subfunctionalized. We have previously shown using the medaka fish Oryzias latipes that pigment cell formation is severely affected by the loss of sox10a, yet unaffected by the loss of sox10b. Here we aimed to determine whether Sox9 is involved in the specification of pigment cell lineage. The sox9b homozygous mutation did not affect pigment cell formation, despite lethality at the early larval stages. By employing sox10a, sox10b, and sox9b mutations, compound mutants were established for the sox9b and sox10 genes and pigment cell phenotypes were analyzed. Simultaneous loss of sox9b and sox10a resulted in the complete absence of melanophores and xanthophores from hatchlings and severely defective iridophore formation, as has been previously shown for sox10a-/- ; sox10b-/- double mutants, indicating that Sox9b as well as Sox10b functions redundantly with Sox10a in pigment cell development. Notably, leucophores were present in sox9b-/- ; sox10a-/- and sox10a-/- ; sox10b-/- double mutants, but their numbers were significantly reduced in the sox9b-/- ; sox10a-/- mutants.

Very recently, the diagnostic value of a set of 16 diagnostic criteria for ST was determined. The next step in the development of easily applicable diagnostic criteria is to provide an uncomplicated model, based on the existing criteria, which can easily be used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct an accurate decision tree, combining several diagnostic criteria, to optimize both sensitivity and specificity of ST diagnosis. DESIGN: An online survey was launched on the online forum Tinnitus Talk, managed by Tinnitus Hub in a convenience sample of participants with tinnitus. The survey included 42 questions, both on the presence of diagnostic criteria for ST and on other potentially influencing factors. A decision tree was constructed to classify participants with and without ST using the rpart package in R. Tree depth was optimized during a five-fold cross-validation. Finally, model performance was evaluated on a subset containing 20% of the original dataset. RESULTS: Data of 7981 participants were used to construct a decision tree for ST diagnosis. Four criteria were included in the final decision tree: 'Tinnitus and neck/jaw pain increase/decrease simultaneously', 'Tension in suboccipital muscles', 'Somatic modulation', and 'Bruxism'. The presented model has an accuracy of 82.2%, a sensitivity of 82.5%, and a specificity of 79%. Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.88.

METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively.

The pilot-tested questionnaire covered influenza and influenza vaccination in terms of the patient demographics, medical history and knowledge, attitudes and practices. RESULTS A total of 307 diabetics participated in the study. Of these, 139 (45.3 percent) claimed to know the difference between influenza and the common cold, while 98 (31.9 percent) and 18 (5.9 percent) participants thought that influenza vaccines protected against all influenza strains and provided lifelong immunity, respectively. 247 (80.4 percent) participants were aware that they were at a moderate or higher risk for influenza-related complications, while 181 (58.9 percent) considered vaccination to be effective in preventing influenza and its complications. Only 94 (30.6 percent) participants were previously vaccinated. Among those unvaccinated, 117 (54.9 percent) did not think vaccination was necessary, while 104 (48.8 percent) had never considered it. As observed from the multivariate analysis, income was a key predictor of influenza vaccination. While 241 (78.5 percent) participants cited healthcare professional advice as the main guiding factor for getting vaccinated, 199 (64.8 percent) had never been advised on influenza vaccination.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and appraise the predictive performance, predictor utility, model application, and model utility of hospital admission prediction models that utilized prehospital, adult patient data and aimed to address emergency department crowding. METHODS: We searched multiple databases for studies, from inception to September 30, 2019, that evaluated models predicting adult patients imminent hospital admission, with prehospital patient data and regression analysis. We used PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool) and CHARMS (Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies) to critically assess studies. RESULTS: Potential biases were found in most studies, which suggested that each models predictive performance required further investigation. We found that select prehospital patient data contribute to the identification of patients requiring hospital admission. Biomarker predictors may add superior value and advantages to models. It is, however, important to note that no models had been integrated with an information system or workflow, operated independently as electronic devices, or operated in real time within the care environment. Several models could be used at the site-of-care in real time without digital devices, which would make them suitable for low-technology or no-electricity environments. CONCLUSIONS: There is incredible potential for prehospital admission prediction models to improve patient care and hospital operations. Patient data can be utilized to act as predictors and as data-driven, actionable tools to identify patients likely to require imminent hospital admission and reduce patient boarding and crowding in emergency departments. Prediction models can be used to justify earlier patient admission and care, to lower morbidity and mortality, and models that utilize biomarker predictors offer additional advantages.","output":"Models Predicting Hospital Admission of Adult Patients Utilizing Prehospital Data: Systematic Review Using PROBAST and CHARMS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deadly global outbreak of COVID-19 has forged an unrivaled threat to human civilization.

STUDY DESIGN Historical cohort study. ANIMALS 333 client-owned dogs. METHODS Medical records from 1 private referral hospital were searched for dogs that underwent gastrointestinal surgery between November 1999 and October 2015. Cases were included if skin staplers were used to close linear gastrointestinal incisions. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was collected. RESULTS Complications were diagnosed in 8 of 245 (3.27%) dogs, including 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs that died or were euthanized, 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs with incisional dehiscence, and 2 of 245 (0.81%) dogs with attachment of a linear foreign body to the staples at the intestinal lumen. Dehiscence was noted at the enterotomy sites in 3 dogs at a mean time of 44 hours after surgery (SD  6.93). Two dogs presented with another linear foreign body that was attached to the staples in the intestinal lumen at postoperative days 24 and 42. The risk factors associated with incisional dehiscence included multiple gastrointestinal incisions performed in 1 surgery (2 , P < .001) and the presence of a linear foreign body (2 , P = .02253). No associations were detected between dogs' age, sex, weight, surgery time, indication for surgical intervention, surgery location in the gastrointestinal tract, or surgeon experience and incisional dehiscence. CONCLUSION Skin staplers provide safe and effective closure of gastrotomies, enterotomies, and colonotomies in dogs.

Community-engaged dissemination and implementation research (CEDI) emphasizes engaging stakeholders (e.g., community members, practitioners, community organizations, etc.) with diverse perspectives, experience, and expertise to provide tacit community knowledge regarding the local context, priorities, needs, and assets. Importantly, CEDI can help improve health inequities through incorporating unique perspectives from communities experiencing health inequities that have historically been left out of the research process. The community-engagement process that exists in practice can be highly variable, and characteristics of the process are often underreported, making it difficult to discern how engagement of community partners was used to improve implementation.

The number of confirmed cases has continued to increase, causing damage to society and the economy worldwide. The public pays close attention to information on the pandemic and learns about the disease through various media outlets. The dissemination of comprehensive and accurate COVID-19 information that the public needs helps to educate people so they can take preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the dissemination of COVID-19 information by analyzing the information released by the official WeChat account of the People's Daily during the pandemic. The most-read COVID-19 information in China was summarized, and the factors that influence information dissemination were studied to understand the characteristics that affect its dissemination. Moreover, this was conducted in order to identify how to effectively disseminate COVID-19 information and to provide suggestions on how to manage public opinion and information governance during a pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on a WeChat official account. We collected all COVID-19-related information, starting with the first report about COVID-19 from the People's Daily and ending with the last piece of information about lifting the first-level emergency response in 34 Chinese provinces. A descriptive analysis was then conducted on this information, as well as on Qingbo Big Data's dissemination index. Multiple linear regression was utilized to study the factors that affected information dissemination based on various characteristics and the dissemination index. RESULTS: From January 19 to May 2, 2020, the People's Daily released 1984 pieces of information; 1621 were related to COVID-19, which mainly included headline news items, items with emotional content, and issues related to the pandemic's development. By analyzing the dissemination index, seven information dissemination peaks were discerned. Among the three dimensions of COVID-19 information-media salience, content, and format-eight factors affected the spread of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of pandemic-related information have varying dissemination power. To effectively disseminate information and prevent the spread of COVID-19, we should identify the factors that affect this dissemination. We should then disseminate the types of information the public is most concerned about, use information to educate people to improve their health literacy, and improve public opinion and information governance.","output":"COVID-19 Information Dissemination Using the WeChat Communication Index: Retrospective Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: By mid-July 2020, more than 108,000 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed in Canada with more than half in the province of Quebec. In this context, we launched a study to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the socio-economic impact of the spring outbreak in the population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-19 related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test. These associations were measured with univariate and multivariate analyses using a hybrid tree-based regression model. RESULTS: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. Approximately 8% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-19 related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyses adjusted on exposure factors showed that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were gender and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-19 related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 spring outbreak in Quebec, Canada: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reference method for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections is blood culture followed by biochemical identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolated pathogen.

Endosomal-mediated transport to the plasma membrane ensures cytokine secretion in dendritic cells (DCs) and the initiation of effector immune responses. Despite the critical importance of this process, the specific molecular agents that regulate DC cytokine secretion are poorly characterised. Galectin-9, a ?-galactoside-binding protein, has emerged as novel modulator of numerous cellular processes although its exact functions remain to be elucidated. In particular, its intracellular roles in regulating (immune) cell homeostasis and cytosolic transport are virtually unknown. Here, we investigated galectin-9 function in cytokine secretion in primary human DCs, and report that galectin-9 is essential for intracellular trafficking of cytokines to the cell surface. Galectin-9 depletion resulted in the accumulation of cytokine-containing vesicles in the Golgi complex that eventually underwent lysosomal degradation. We observed galectin-9 to molecularly interact with Vamp-3 using unbiased immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry technology, and identified that galectin-9 was required for rerouting of Vamp-3-containing endosomes to the plasma membrane for cargo release upon DC activation as the underlying mechanism. Overall, this study identifies galectin-9 as a necessary mechanistic component for intracellular trafficking. This may impact our general understanding of vesicle machinery and transport and shed new light into the multiple roles galectin and glycan-mediated interactions play in governing cell function.","output":"Galectin-9 interacts with Vamp-3 to regulate cytokine secretion in dendritic cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group testing, the testing paradigm which combines multiple samples within a single test, was introduced in 1943 by Robert Dorfman. Since its original proposal for syphilis screening, group testing has been applied in domains such as fault identification in electrical and computer networks, machine learning, data mining, and cryptography. TheSARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to proposals for using group testing in its original context of identifying infected individuals in a population with few tests. Studies suggest that non-adaptive group testing - in which all the tests are determined in advance - for SARS-CoV-2could help save 20% to 90% of tests depending on the prevalence. However, no systematic approach for comparing different non-adaptive group testing strategies currently exists. In this paper we develop a software platform for evaluating non-adaptive group testing strategies in both a noiseless setting and in the presence of realistic noise sources, modelled on published experimental observations, which makes them applicable to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the dominant type of tests for SARS-CoV-2. This modular platform can be used with a variety of group testing designs and decoding algorithms. We use it to evaluate the performance of near-doubly-regular designs and a decoding algorithm based on an integer linear programming formulation, both of which are known to be optimal in some regimes. We find savings between 40% and 91% of tests for prevalences up to 10% when a small error (below 5%) is allowed. We also find that the performance degrades gracefully with noise.

PURPOSE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of physical exercise on different outcomes in patients with a concussion. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A search of 5 databases from the earliest available date to September 30, 2016, and a hand search of a few articles were performed. Trial registries were reviewed, and authors of multiple studies were contacted to find additional published or unpublished studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and before and after (pre-post) studies evaluating the effect of physical exercise, compared with control, in patients with a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury were included. RESULTS The search generated 1096 studies. Of these, 14 studies (5 RCTs, 1 propensity score matching study, 3 cohort studies, and 5 before and after studies) met our inclusion criteria. Exercise significantly decreased the PCSS score (mean difference, -13.06; 95% CI, -16.57 to -9.55; P < .00001; I2 = 44%), percentage of patients with symptoms of a concussion (risk ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.86; P = .0001; I2 = 0%), and days off work (17.7 days vs 32.2 days, respectively; P < .05) compared with control.

Therefore, the likelihood of encountering an individual who has experienced significant trauma within forensic settings is high (Dalenberg, Straus, & Ardill, 2017). Further, forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the impact of such traumatic events and to opine about their connection to a specific psycho-legal issue such as damages in a civil case or the presence of extreme emotional disturbance or mitigating factors in criminal matters. Childhood trauma that has occurred repeatedly and cumulatively, particularly within the context of family relationships, has been referred to as complex trauma. Complex trauma has been shown to result in significant difficulties in a broad range of capabilities such as affect regulation, dissociation, identity development, relational capacities, and somatic distress (Courtois and Ford 2009).

METHOD Participants were 316 spouse (and partner) caregivers of SMVs following a mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI. Caregivers completed the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale, 24 HRQOL questionnaires, and the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (4th ed.; MPAI-4). The sample was divided into two family functioning groups: Healthy Family Functioning (HFF; n = 162) and Unhealthy Family Functioning (UFF; n = 154). Scores on HRQOL measures that generate T scores using normative data were classified as \\"clinically elevated,\\" using a cutoff of > 60T. RESULTS Compared with the HFF group, caregivers in the UFF group reported worse scores on all HRQOL measures and worse SMV functional ability on the MPAI-4 Adjustment Index and Anxiety, Depression, and Irritability/Anger/Aggression items (all ps < .001, ds = .41-1.36). A significantly higher proportion of the UFF group had clinically elevated HRQOL scores compared with the HFF group on the majority of measures (Hs = .24-.75). When examining all HRQOL measures simultaneously, the UFF group consistently had a significantly higher cumulative percentage of clinically elevated scores compared with the HFF group (e.g.,  5 clinically elevated scores: UFF = 53.9% vs. HFF = 22.2%; H = .68). CONCLUSIONS Caring for a SMV following TBI with comorbid mental health problems may have negative implications for their family functioning and the caregiver's HRQOL.

There has been limited data to recommend either for or against use of antiviral regimens in mild COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral drugs and those without. METHOD: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at field hospital affiliated to Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were evaluated between January 1, 2020 and April 13, 2021. Patients data, clinical presentation, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with positive tests were included in the study. The mean age was 35.9 years; 46% males. There were 225 (45%), 207 (41.4%), 44 (8.8%), 18 (3.6%), 6 (1.2%) patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Of 207 mild COVID-19 patients, 9 (4.3%) received lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir, 17 (8.2%) received favipiravir, while 175 (84.5%) had only supportive care. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral treatment had longer median length of hospital stay [13 days (IQR 11C14) vs. 10 days (IQR 8C12), p < 0.001] than patients having only supportive treatment. Antiviral drug use was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (>10 days) in mild COVID-19 patients (OR 5.52; 95%CI 2.12C14.40, p < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis were also demonstrated in our COVID-19 patients with antiviral treatments. Majority of patients (97.6%) recovered without any complications and were discharged home. Two deaths were caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatment could not provide superior clinical outcomes to supportive care in mild COVID-19 patients. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral medication had longer length of hospital stay than those without.

Reconstructed images obtained by DCE-THRIVE and the coronal e-THRIVE were compared mainly in terms of the completeness of the lateral thoracic artery, thoracodorsal artery, and lymph nodes. We proposed a criterion for evaluating image quality. According to the criterion, images were assigned a score from 1 to 5 according to the grade from low to high. Two board-certified doctors evaluated images individually, and their average score was taken as the final result. The chi-square test was used to assess the difference. RESULTS: The coronal e-THRIVE score is 4.60, which is higher than the DCE-THRIVE score of 3.48, there are significant differences between the images obtained by two sequences (P = 1.2712e?8).

To be useful, the remotely-collected measurements should be valid, reliable and sensitive to change, and people with PD must engage with the technology. We developed a smartwatch-based active assessment that enables unsupervised measurement of motor signs of PD. 388 study participants with early-stage PD (Personalized Parkinson Project, 64% men, average age 63 years) wore a smartwatch for a median of 390 days, allowing for continuous passive monitoring. Participants performed unsupervised motor tasks both in the clinic (once) and remotely (twice weekly for one year). Dropout rate was 2% at the end of follow-up. Median wear-time was 21.1 hours/day, and 59% of per-protocol remote assessments were completed. In-clinic performance of the virtual exam verified that most participants correctly followed watch-based instructions. Analytical validation was established for in-clinic measurements, which showed moderate-to-strong correlations with consensus MDS-UPDRS Part III ratings for rest tremor (R=0.70), bradykinesia (R=-0.62), and gait (R=-0.46). Test-retest reliability of remote measurements, aggregated monthly, was good-to-excellent (ICC: 0.75 - 0.96).

Of note, in-clinic assessments often did not reflect the patients' typical status at home. This demonstrates the feasibility of using smartwatch-based unsupervised active tests, and establishes the analytical validity of associated digital measurements. Weekly measurements can create a more complete picture of patient functioning by providing a real-life distribution of disease severity, as it fluctuates over time.

Results: Our review identified 34 studies investigating multimorbidity longitudinally, all published in the last decade, and with a clear lack of research based on low- and middle-income country data. Longitudinal approaches included constructing variables of change, multilevel regression analysis (e.g. growth curve modelling), longitudinal group-based methodologies (e.g. latent class modelling), analysing disease transitions, and visualisation techniques. Commonly identified risk factors for multimorbidity onset and progression were older age, higher deprivation, overweight, and poorer health behaviours. Conclusion: The nascent research area employs a diverse range of longitudinal approaches that characterize accumulation and disease combinations, and to a lesser extent disease sequencing and progression. Understanding the life course determinants of different multimorbidity trajectories across diverse populations and settings can provide a detailed picture of morbidity development, with important implications from a clinical and intervention perspective.","output":"Studying trajectories of multimorbidity: a systematic scoping review of longitudinal approaches and evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory and intestinal tract are two primary target organs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking. METHODS: We utilized immunofluorescence assays, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR to delineate the virological features and the innate immune response of the host cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in two prototype human cell lines representing the human lung (Calu3) and intestinal (Caco2) epithelium when compared with SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Lung epithelial cells were significantly more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced an attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines induction and type I and type II IFN responses. A single dose of 10a?U/mL interferon-? (IFN?) pretreatment potently protected both Calu3 and Caco2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to the pretreatment with IFN? and IFN inducer than SARS-CoV in Calu3. CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust infection in both human lung and intestinal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 could attenuate the virus-induced pro-inflammatory response and IFN response. Pre-activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway primed a highly efficient antiviral response in the host against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could serve as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic maneuver to COVID-19 patients.","output":"Differential immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung and intestinal cells: Implications for treatment with IFN-? and IFN inducer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report three otherwise healthy neonates born to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) positive mothers who developed apnea during birth admission but tested negative for COVID-19 We postulate that the apnea may be due to transplacental transmission of inflammatory cytokines We strongly advise against early discharge in babies born to mothers with active COVID-19 infection [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Neonatology Today is the property of Loma Linda Publishing Company and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Apnea in Term and Late Preterm Neonates Born to Coronavirus Infected Mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections in immunodeficient patients are an important source of variation for the virus but are understudied. Many case studies have been published which describe one or a small number of long-term infected individuals but no study has combined these sequences into a cohesive dataset. This work aims to rectify this and study the genomics of this patient group through a combination of literature searches as well as identifying new case series directly from the COG-UK dataset. The spike gene receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domains (NTD) were identified as mutation hotspots. Numerous mutations associated with variants of concern were observed to emerge recurrently. Additionally a mutation in the envelope gene, - T30I was determined to be the most recurrent frequently occurring mutation arising in persistent infections. A high proportion of recurrent mutations in immunodeficient individuals are associated with ACE2 affinity, immune escape, or viral packaging optimisation. There is an apparent selective pressure for mutations which aid intra-host transmission or persistence which are often different to mutations which aid inter-host transmission, although the fact that multiple recurrent de novo mutations are considered defining for variants of concern strongly indicates that this potential source of novel variants should not be discounted.","output":"Recurrent SARS-CoV-2 Mutations in Immunodeficient Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity after natural infection or vaccination, functional assays such as virus neutralizing assays are needed. So far, assays to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation assay (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralization capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralization assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT. Clinical sensitivity increased between early (<14 days post symptom onset or post diagnosis, dpos/dpd) and late sera (>14 dpos/dpd) from 75.0 (64.7-83.2) to 83.1 (76.5-88.1). Also, higher severity was associated with an increase in clinical sensitivity.

Methods: We searched official websites in both Australia and New Zealand (NZ) to identify outbreaks and border control failures associated with hotel quarantine (searches conducted up to 12 February 2021). We used two denominators: a) the estimated number of travelers who went through these facilities during the 2020 year up to 31 January 2021; and b) the equivalent number of SARS-CoV-2 positive people who went through these facilities. Results: Up to 31 January 2021, Australia had seven failures with one causing over 800 deaths and six resulting in lockdowns. In NZ there were nine failures, with one causing an outbreak with three deaths, and also a lockdown. The overall failure risk for those transiting quarantine was estimated at one failure per 20,702 travelers and one failure per 252 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (both countries combined). At the country level, there were 15.5 failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting quarantine in NZ (95%CI: 5.4 to 25.7), compared to 2.0 per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Australia (0.5 to 3.5), a greater than seven-fold difference in risk.

Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species.

The aim of this study was to understand if and how COVID-19 was influencing kratom purchasing and use. Methods: Additional questions specific to kratom availability and changes in use during COVID-19 were added to an international online survey with responses collected between January and July 2020. During the same period, kratom-related social media posts to Twitter, Reddit, and Bluelight were analyzed for themes similar to the survey questions. Results: The survey results indicated no changes in kratom use patterns although the sample size was relatively small (n = 70) with younger consumers reporting a potential issue in obtaining their desired products from their usual sources. The survey respondents identified primarily as non-Hispanic whites (87.1%). Social media themes revolved primarily around quitting kratom during COVID-19, misinformation about the effects of kratom on COVID-19, and other non-COVID-related discussions. While some consumers may increase their kratom dose because of additional stress, a majority of discussions centered around reducing or rationing kratom due to COVID-19 or a perceived dependence. Access to quality kratom products was also a major discussion topic on social media.

AIM OF THE STUDY: evaluate the preliminary impact of CoVID-19 in three Italian Orthopedics and Traumatology Departments in the first 10 weeks of the national lockdown. We focused on proximal humerus fractures, analyzing data and results in comparison with the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22(nd) to May 3(rd) 2020, 55 patients were admitted to our departments for promixal humerus fractures. Our cohort of patients is composed by 13 males (23.6%) and 42 females (76.4%), with an average age of 73.8  11.7 years (range 44 - 94). Trauma occurred at home in 43 cases (78.2%), by the roadside in 10 cases (18.2%), in a retirement home in 1 case (1.8%), and at work in 1 case (1.8%). We proposed surgical treatment in 15/55 cases, but 4 patients refused hospitalization, mainly because of the risk of contracting n-CoV19 infection. RESULTS: We noticed a decrease in proximal humerus fractures compared to 2019 (-37.5%). Particularly, we observed a significant drop in traumas occurred on the road and at work respectively 23.9% and 3.4%% in 2019, and 18.2% and 1.8% in 2020, probably due to the consequences of the national lockdown. Sports traumas had a reset during the pandemic (6 cases in 2019, 0 in 2020). As consequence, surgical treatment had a decrease due to the reduction in number of fractures, indications and patients consent. CONCLUSION: The incidence of proximal humerus fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread.

Given the paucity of published data regarding complications, we review the collective experience as well as share our own results and observations. METHODS A literature search of published series on LESS was performed focusing on complications and other difficulties associated with this new technique. The experience with LESS at our institution was also evaluated for complications and means of avoiding them. RESULTS A few complications relating to LESS specifically are reported in the literature. These are generally related to the access site and the ability to manage situations that require added dexterity. Conversion to standard laparoscopy (or open surgery) is rare while insertion of an additional port appears to be more common.

Persons with and without morbid obesity were compared using Poisson regression to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of morbid obesity for COVID-19 hospitalization and for severe disease (intensive care unit admission or death). Differences in the effect by age, sex and chronic conditions were evaluated. RESULTS Individuals with morbid obesity had higher risk of hospitalization (aRR=2.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-2.93) and severe COVID-19 (aRR=2.30; 95%CI 1.20-4.40).

In this paper we identify and describe the multiple causes of fragmentation in development assistant for health at the global level. The study is of particular relevance since the emergence of new global health problems such as COVID-19 heightens the need for global health actors to work in coordinated ways. Our study is part of the Lancet Commission on Synergies between Universal Health Coverage, Health Security and Health Promotion. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach. This consisted of a non-systematic literature review of published papers in scientific journals, reports, books and websites. We also carried out twenty semi-structured expert interviews with individuals from bilateral and multilateral organisations, governments and academic and research institutions between April 2019 and December 2019. RESULTS: We identified five distinct yet interconnected sets of factors causing fragmentation: proliferation of global health actors; problems of global leadership; divergent interests; problems of accountability; problems of power relations. We explain why global health actors struggle to harmonise their approaches and priorities, fail to align their work with low- and middle-income countries needs and why they continue to embrace funding instruments that create fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Many global actors are genuinely committed to addressing the problems of fragmentation, despite their complexity and interconnected nature. This paper aims to raise awareness and understanding of the causes of fragmentation and to help guide actors efforts in addressing the problems and moving to more synergistic approaches.","output":"Its far too complicated: why fragmentation persists in global health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diagnostic injections (blocks) are a valuable tool in the management of chronic noncancer pain. By precise blockade of specific neural structures and observation of pain responses, pain mechanisms can be accurately defined. With such information, therapeutic procedures targeting neural structures are possible. Fibromyalgia is a disorder of pain processing with characteristic symptoms. The 2010 American College of Rheumatologists fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria evaluates these symptoms in a scoring system, allowing more objectivity in the diagnosis. We hypothesize that patients with fibromyalgia phenotype fulfilling the 2010 American College of Rheumatologists criteria may respond to diagnostic blocks differently when compared to patients without fibromyalgia phenotype. OBJECTIVES This study was designed to establish whether diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of fibromyalgia should influence the decision to perform diagnostic blocks for chronic non-cancer pain. STUDY DESIGN A prospective observational research study was performed at our institution. IRAS project ID: 231514. SETTING Tertiary pain clinic in the UK. METHODS Patients were selected to receive diagnostic block by usual clinical assessment after which they were asked to consent to take part in the study. All participating patients completed the 2010 American College of Rheumatologists fibromyalgia diagnostic questionnaire prior to the diagnostic block. Patients were divided into 2 groups A and B based on the outcome of block - primary outcome. Group A experienced a 70% or greater improvement in pain severity following the block for the anticipated duration of action of the local anesthetic, Group B experienced a less than 70% reduction in pain. Statistical analysis between groups A and B was conducted by comparing categorical data, described as percentages, with the chi squared test. Ordinal variables such as Widespread pain index and Symptom severity score are presented as median and analyzed with Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included in the study. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 75 remaining patients, 44 received lumbar medial branch blocks, 19 genicular nerve blocks, 3 blocks to nerves supplying the sacroiliac joint, one suprascapular nerve block, and 6 cervical and 2 thoracic medial branch blocks. Group A contained 38 patients and group B contained 37 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fibromyalgia screening questionnaire positive patients between groups A (13 out of 38 patients) and B (13 out of 37 patients), P = 0.93. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fibromyalgia screening questionnaire positive patients in subgroups undergoing the same type of diagnostic block (spinal pain and knee pain). LIMITATIONS Selection of patients prior to inclusion in the study may introduce bias. Patients were selected by individual treating clinicians using usual clinical practice; however, the exact selection criteria were not standardized. CONCLUSION We conclude that after physician selection, the presence of fibromyalgia phenotype does not influence the outcome from diagnostic block. It is likely therefore that fibromyalgia phenotype should not influence the decision to perform diagnostic blocks if indicated based on assessment by an experienced pain physician.","output":"Should a Coexisting or Suspected Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia Affect the Decision to Perform Diagnostic Blocks for Patients with Chronic Noncancer Pain - Results from an Observational Research Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has shown a correlation between votes for populist parties and the belief that vaccines are not important or effective.

We review epidemiological and clinical data that point to the important roles psychiatric disorders have in the use and abuse of opioids in patients with chronic pain. METHOD We conducted literature searches on the PubMed with the key phrases \\"chronic pain\\" and \\"opioid therapy\\" and selected those articles on the epidemiology of comorbidity between chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, the trends in long-term opioid therapy and the clinical trials that involved using opioid therapy for chronic pain or for mental health disorders. We then thoroughly reviewed the bibliography of all relevant articles to identify additional papers to be included in the present review. RESULTS Chronic pain is highly comorbid with common psychiatric disorders. Patients with mental health and substance abuse disorders are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain and more likely to have adverse outcomes from this therapy. Although opioids may exert brief antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in some patients with depression or anxiety, there is scant evidence for long-term benefit from opioid treatment of psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS Opioids may be used in current clinical practice as the de facto and only psychiatric treatment for patients with chronic pain, despite little evidence for sustained benefit. The opioid epidemic thus reflects a serious unmet need for better recognition and treatment of common mental health problems in patients with chronic pain.

The UT Teleneurology (UTT) hub provides acute neurological coverage by stroke specialists to 18 spoke centers. To our knowledge, the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the weekend effect has not been studied. The objective is to compare TM consult volumes and time metrics of stroke patients who received tPA via TM off-hours with those on-hours during the pandemic. In a retrospective query of the UTT registry from 3/20 - 6/20, we identified 122 stroke patients who received tPA - 109 were included in our analysis - 2 were excluded after quality check, 11 were excluded as inpatient strokes. We compared baseline characteristics and time metrics between the off-hours (5pm-7:59am, weekends) and on-hours (weekdays 8am-4:59pm) patients (Table 1). We also compared the number of TM consults between the height of the pandemic (3/20 - 6/20) and the previous year (3/19 - 6/19). Of 109 patients, 72 were managed via TM during off-hours, 37 during on-hours. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were no differences in time metrics including door to needle time. Of note, there was no difference in the number of acute TM consults or patients receiving tPA. There were fewer routine TM consults during the pandemic, and a trend toward fewer phone consults. There was no difference in time metrics between the patients treated off-hours vs on-hours in the pandemic period. TM may be advantageous over in-person neurology coverage during crises, and is consistent regardless of the hour/day. Contrary to other studies, the number of acute TM consults and patients receiving tPA did not differ between the study periods. Routine consults decreased during the pandemic - perhaps coinciding with state closure mandates/fewer hospitalized stroke patients.

This study aimed to (1) identify factors and characteristics associated with fear of COVID-19, (2) investigate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and maternal anxiety and depression, and (3) determine the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: 9251 pregnant Canadians were recruited between April C December 2020. Participants self-reported (scale of 0C100) the degree of threat they perceived from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in relation to themselves and their unborn baby. RESULTS: Mean fear scores indicated moderate to elevated concern. In multivariable linear regression, fear of COVID-19 was associated with food insecurity, ethnicity, geographic location, history of anxiety prior to pregnancy, having a chronic health condition, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, and stage of pregnancy at study enrollment. Higher COVID-19 fear was associated with increased odds of depression, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.75, p < 0.001, 95% CI 1.66C1.85, and anxiety, aOR=2.04, p < 0.001, 95% CI 1.94C2.15).

The various state regional health services organizational and management structures are focused on caring for acute illnesses and are dominated by hospitals and technology. In a review by the Interstate Council, a body for intercommunication and cooperation between the state health care services and national government, there is a move to improve health care through an integrative approach between specialized care and primary care at the state level. Community pharmacy does not appear to have a major role in this review. Primary health care is becoming more important and leading the change to improve the roles of the health care teams. Primary care pharmacists as the rest of public health professionals are employed by the respective states and are considered public servants. Total health care expenditure is 9.0% of its GDP with the public health sector accounting for the 71% and the private sector 29% of this expenditure. Community pharmacy contracts with each state health administration for the supply and dispensing of medicines and a very limited number of services. There are approximately 22,000 community pharmacies and 52,000 community pharmacists for a population of 47 million people. All community pharmacies are privately owned with only pharmacists owning a single pharmacy. Pharmacy chain stores are not legally permitted. Community pharmacy practice is based on dispensing of medications and dealing with consumer minor symptoms and requests for nonprescription medications although extensive philosophical deep debates on the conceptual and practical development of new clinical services have resulted in national consensually agreed classifications, definitions and protocolized services. There are a few remunerated services in Spain and these are funded at state, provincial or municipal level. There are no health services approved or funded at a national level. Although the profession promulgates a patient orientated community pharmacy it appears to be reluctant to advocate for a change in the remuneration model. The profession as a whole should reflect on the role of community pharmacy and advocate for a change to practice that is patient orientated alongside the maintenance of its stance on being a medication supplier.

The need for a new paradigm of foreign investment and aid in agricultural production is becoming exigent in developing countries. Given the decline in per capita arable land, the rise in production costs, and the increase in population and urbanization, major changes in agriculture have been proposed to boost agricultural production. This present study endeavours to contribute to the existing literature by proving whether foreign capital and economic freedom could catapult food production into the much-anticipated growth. In that regard, we performed GLS with correlated disturbances, system GMM dynamic panel data estimators and D-H causality test. The study found that foreign capital as a whole plays a positive role in food production in developing and least developed countries, but FDI is insignificant in least-developed countries. Moreover, economic freedom plays a positive role in food production in least-developed countries but negative in developing countries. Policymakers and governments should create an enabling environment for sustainable food production.","output":"The role of foreign capital and economic freedom in sustainable food production: Evidence from DLD countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Closed-loop ventilation modes are increasingly being used in intensive care units to ensure more automaticity. Little is known about the visual behavior of health professionals using these ventilation modes. The aim of this study was to analyze gaze patterns of intensive care nurses while ventilating a patient in the closed-loop mode with Intellivent adaptive support ventilation? (I-ASV) and to compare inexperienced with experienced nurses. Materials and Methods: Intensive care nurses underwent eye-tracking during daily care of a patient ventilated in the closed-loop ventilation mode. Five specific areas of interest were predefined (ventilator settings, ventilation curves, numeric values, oxygenation Intellivent, ventilation Intellivent). The main independent variable and primary outcome was dwell time. Secondary outcomes were revisits, average fixation time, first fixation and fixation count on areas of interest in a targeted tracking-time of 60 min. Gaze patterns were compared between I-ASV inexperienced (n = 12) and experienced (n = 16) nurses. Results: In total, 28 participants were included. Overall, dwell time was longer for ventilator settings and numeric values compared to the other areas of interest. Similar results could be obtained for the secondary outcomes. Visual fixation of oxygenation Intellivent and ventilation Intellivent was low. However, dwell time, average fixation time and first fixation on oxygenation Intellivent were longer in experienced compared to inexperienced intensive care nurses. Discussion: Gaze patterns of intensive care nurses were mainly focused on numeric values and settings. Areas of interest related to traditional mechanical ventilation retain high significance for intensive care nurses, despite use of closed-loop mode. More visual attention to oxygenation Intellivent and ventilation Intellivent in experienced nurses implies more routine and familiarity with closed-loop modes in this group. The findings imply the need for constant training and education with new tools in critical care, especially for inexperienced professionals.","output":"Differing Visual Behavior Between Inexperienced and Experienced Critical Care Nurses While Using a Closed-Loop Ventilation SystemA Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A serosurvey of antibodies against selected flaviviruses and alphaviruses in 384 bats (representing 10 genera and 14 species) was conducted in the Caribbean island of Trinidad.

ABSTRACT Objective: To describe the incidence of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX high school athletes, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.Design: Retrospective survey.Setting: High schools across STATE-XXX during September, 2020.Participants: Athletic directors representing 30,074 high school athletes with and without SARS-CoV-2.Independent Variables: COVID-19 rates among athletes, counties, and STATE-XXX, school instruction type (virtual vs in-person), sport type, face mask use.Main Outcome Measurements: Reported athlete case rates compared to their county's general population. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use, adjusting for each school's county incidence using multivariable negative binomial regression models.Results: COVID-19 incidence rates for 207 of 244 responding schools were 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days. Reported case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the county's general population case rates (=1.140.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One case (0.5%) was attributed to sport contact by the reporting schools. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14). Outdoor sports had a lower incidence rate than indoor sports, although this did not reach statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). There were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use during play for those sports with greater than 50 schools reporting on face mask use (p>0.05 for all).Conclusions: Incidence of reported COVID-19 among high school athletes was related to county incidence and most cases were attributed to non-sport contact. A lower COVID-19 incidence in outdoor sports approached statistical significance. The lack of a significant benefit of face mask use may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX during September 2020. Further research is needed to better define COVID-19 transmission risk factors during adolescent sport participation.","output":"Reported COVID-19 Incidence in Wisconsin High School Athletes in Fall 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unhealthy food marketing influences attitudes, preferences, and consumption of unhealthy foods, leading to excess weight gain. Outdoor advertising is highly visible (often displayed on publicly owned assets), but the evidence supporting regulation is unclear. This systematic scoping review of academic and grey literature aimed to (1) describe potential health and economic impacts of implementing government-led policies that restrict unhealthy food advertising in outdoor spaces or on public assets (including studies examining prevalence of advertising, associations with health outcomes and interventional studies); (2) identify and describe existing policies; and (3) identify factors perceived to have influenced policy implementation. Thirty-six academic studies were eligible for inclusion. Most reported on prevalence of unhealthy food advertising, demonstrating high prevalence around schools and in areas of lower socioeconomic position. None examined health and economic impacts of implemented policies. Four jurisdictions were identified with existing regulations; five had broader marketing or consumer protection policies that captured outdoor food marketing. Facilitators of policy implementation included collaboration, effective partnerships, and strong political leadership. Barriers included lobbying by food, media, and advertising industries. Implementation of food marketing policies in outdoor spaces and on public assets is feasible and warranted.

This study attempted to verify this observation by comparing predictions against actual data on the spread and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA. MethodsFocused on the period from March 1st to September 30th, 2020, we compared (1) the predicted interval dates when each SSA country would report 1 000 and 10 000 COVID-19 cases, to the actual dates when these numbers were attained, as well as (2) the daily number of predicted versus actual COVID-19 cases. Further, we calculated the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA, and the correlation coefficient between the weekly average number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by each country and the weekly average stringency index of its anti-COVID-19 policy measures. Results84.61% (33) and 100% (39) of the 39 SSA countries for which predictions were made did not reach a total of 1 000 and 10 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the predicted interval dates. The daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was lower than the one projected for all SSA countries. The case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA was 3.42%. Among the 44 SSA countries for which the correlation could be estimated, it was negative for 17 (38.6 %) of them.

It is considered as a convenient platform for users to share personal messages, pictures, and videos. However, while people enjoy social networks, many deceptive activities such as fake news or rumors can mislead users into believing misinformation. Besides, spreading the massive amount of misinformation in social networks has become a global risk. Therefore, misinformation detection (MID) in social networks has gained a great deal of attention and is considered an emerging area of research interest. We find that several studies related to MID have been studied to new research problems and techniques. While important, however, the automated detection of misinformation is difficult to accomplish as it requires the advanced model to understand how related or unrelated the reported information is when compared to real information. The existing studies have mainly focused on three broad categories of misinformation: false information, fake news, and rumor detection. Therefore, related to the previous issues, we present a comprehensive survey of automated misinformation detection on (i) false information, (ii) rumors, (iii) spam, (iv) fake news, and (v) disinformation. We provide a state-of-the-art review on MID where deep learning (DL) is used to automatically process data and create patterns to make decisions not only to extract global features but also to achieve better results. We further show that DL is an effective and scalable technique for the state-of-the-art MID.

An understanding of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection can help prioritize testing. Methodology We evaluated potential demographic and clinical factors in children who had respiratory viral symptoms and were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral infections. Results Among the 263 symptomatic children tested for routine seasonal respiratory viruses by PCR, 18 (6.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 22.2% of SARS-CoV-2-infected children and 37.1% of SARS-CoV-2-uninfected children had infection with one or more non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens (p = 0.31). Higher proportions of children with compared to without SARS-CoV-2 infection were male (77.8 vs. 51.8%, p = 0.05), Hispanic (44.4% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001), or had the symptoms of fatigue (22.2% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.003) or anosmia/ageusia (11.1% vs. 0%, p = 0.004). History of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and obesity were more common in children with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection (11.1% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.04, and 11.1% vs. 0%, p = 0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, Hispanic ethnicity, symptoms of fatigue or anosmia/ageusia, and presence of obesity (as noted on physical examination) or HIE were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numbers in each category were small, and these preliminary associations require confirmation in future studies. Conclusions In this area of the United States, infection with other viruses did not rule out infection with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, children with respiratory viral symptoms who were of Hispanic ethnicity, had symptoms of weakness/fatigue, or had obesity or HIE were at an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Caring for persons with dementia is a challenge and can lead to negative psychological, physiological and financial consequences for informal carers. Advances in technology have the potential to assist persons with dementia and their carers, through assistive technology devices such as electronic medication dispensers, robotic devices trackers and motion detectors. However, little is known about carers' experience and the impact of these technologies on them. This review aims to investigate the outcomes and experience of carers of persons with dementia, who live at home and use assistive technology. METHODS A systematic search in seven databases and manual searches were carried out using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies on carers of persons with dementia involving the use of assistive technology. The search identified 56 publications with quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method designs. RESULTS The studies reported positive and negative findings and focused on a wide variety of assistive technology devices. There were large differences in the uses of assistive technology, outcome measures used and the quality of studies. Knowledge and acceptance, competence to use and ethical issues when using assistive technology were themes that emerged from the studies. Carers generally appreciated using assistive technology and their experience of use varied. CONCLUSIONS The intention of this systematic review is to list and classify the various types of assistive technology used by carers of persons with dementia and explores the positive and negative aspects, knowledge, acceptance and ethical issues in the use of assistive technology by carers of persons with dementia. We recommend the use of a standard and person-centred system of classifying and naming assistive technology devices and systems and for future research efforts in assistive technology to incorporate a family/carer centred model.

The aim of the present study was to explore KRT15 expression in BRCA based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Genotype-Tissue Expression. KRT15 expression was compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to reveal the biological roles and pathways of KRT15. The association between KRT15 expression and immune-cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). To investigate the relationship between clinicopathological features and KRT15 expression, the prognostic value of KRT15 and other clinical factors was evaluated using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots. Subgroup prognostic analysis was also performed using forest plots and KM curves. Finally, a tissue microarray was used to assess KRT15 expression in BRCA tissues. KRT15 expression was significantly lower in BRCA tissues compared with that in normal tissues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that KRT15-related genes were primarily enriched in the transmembrane transporter complex, cornification and ligand-receptor interactions. Increased KRT15 was associated with several tumor-suppressive pathways. ssGSEA revealed that high KRT15 expression was significantly associated with natural killer-cell, B-cell and mast-cell infiltration. Significant associations were observed between low KRT15 expression and advanced stage clinicopathological factors, as well as unfavorable overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that KRT15 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P=0.039; hazard ratio, 0.590; 95% CI, 0.358-0.974). Subgroup prognostic analysis demonstrated that low KRT15 was a reliable predictor of poor OS. Immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray indicated that positive KRT15 expression rates were significantly higher in normal tissues compared with those in the BRCA tissues. In conclusion, low KRT15 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with BRCA. Thus, KRT15 may serve an important role in BRCA progression and may be used as a promising prognostic marker for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in patients with BRCA.","output":"Low KRT15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast invasive carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (named by the World Health Organization, WHO), has spread widely since the end of 2019. Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CLproor Mpro), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic.","output":"Current Findings Regarding Natural Components With Potential Anti-2019-nCoV Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foodborne pathogens are one of the main concerns in public health, which can have a serious impact on community health and health care systems. Contamination of foods by bacterial pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella typhimurium) results in human infection. A typical example is the current issue with Coronavirus, which has the potential for foodborne transmission and ruling out such concerns is often difficult. Although, the possible dissemination of such viruses via the food chain has been raised. Standard bacterial detection methods require several hours or even days to obtain the results, and the delay may result in food poisoning to eventuate. Conventional biochemical and microbiological tests are expensive, complex, time-consuming and not always reliable. Therefore, there are urgent demands to develop simple, cheap, quick, sensitive, specific and reliable tests for the detection of these pathogens in foods. Recent advances in smart materials, nanomaterials and biomolecular modeling have been a quantum leap in the development of biosensors in overcoming the limitations of a conventional standard laboratory assay. This research aimed to critically review bacteriophage-based biosensors, used for the detection of foodborne pathogens, as well as their trends, outcomes and challenges are discussed. The future perspective in the use of simple and cheap biosensors is in the development of lab-on-chips, and its availability in every household to test the quality of their food.","output":"Bacteriophage Based Biosensors: Trends, Outcomes and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmissibility or immune escape have been causing large outbreaks of COVID-19 infections across the world. As most of the vaccines currently in use have been derived from viral strains circulating in the early part of the pandemic, it becomes imperative to constantly assess the efficacy of these vaccines against emerging variants.

Viral genome sequencing revealed that >90% of patients in both groups were harbouring the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccinated individuals showed higher neutralizing antibodies (545+-1256 AU/ml Vs 51.1+-296 AU/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased Ferritin (392.26+-448.4 ng/mL Vs 544.82+-641.41 ng/mL; p<0.001) and LDH (559.45+-324.05 U/L Vs 644.99+- 294.03 U/L; p<0.001), when compared to the unvaccinated group. Severity of the disease (3.2% Vs 7.2%; p=0.0039) and requirement of ventilatory support (2.8% Vs 5.9%; p=0.0154) were significantly low in the vaccinated group despite the fact that these individuals had significantly higher age and risk factors. The rate of mortality was about 50% lower (2/132=1.51%) in the completely vaccinated breakthrough infections although mortality in individuals who had received a single dose was similar to the unvaccinated group (9/269=3.35% vs 23/666= 3.45%).

Thus, cellular mechanisms that control inflammation are of high therapeutic interest. Autophagy has been implicated in the suppression of inflammation, yet mechanistic links between autophagy and inflammation are not completely understood. Previous work demonstrated that loss of ATG9A, but not ATG5 or ATG7, increased inflammatory signaling through the STING-IRF3 cascade, suggesting that perhaps an autophagy-independent function of ATG9A regulates inflammation.1 Here, we show that loss of the essential basal autophagy regulators ATG9A and ATG101 sensitizes cells to dsDNA-induced IRF3 activation. Importantly, this effect was not observed with the loss of ATG5 or ATG7, suggesting that the canonical LC3-lipidation autophagy machinery is not required for suppression of IRF3 and inflammatory signaling.2 In an effort to understand the role of ATG9A and ATG101 in suppressing inflammatory signaling, we found that loss of ATG9A and ATG101, but not ATG5 or ATG7, caused an accumulation of ubiquitin-rich condensates. We also found that the accumulation of ubiquitin-rich condensates coincided with an overactivation of the ubiquitin-sensing, IRF3-targeted kinase TBK1. Importantly, we found that inhibiting the accumulation of ubiquitin-rich condensates via knock-out of p62/SQSTM1 abrogated the increased inflammatory signaling caused by loss of ATG9A. Together, our data suggest a model in which the loss of basal autophagy machinery causes an accumulation of ubiquitin-rich condensates, which, in turn, act as a platform for the aberrant activation of TBK1-mediated inflammatory signaling. We propose that these data have important implications for diseases of protein aggregation wherein similar ubiquitin-rich condensates form and aberrant inflammatory signaling plays a pathological role.

The perioperative outcomes of 60 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent this operation between March 2014 and June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The upper mediastinal dissection including lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, using a left cervical approach, was performed with a single-port mediastinoscopic technique, which was used to improve the visibility and handling in the deep mediastinum around the aortic arch. The lymphadenectomy along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve was performed under direct vision using a right cervical approach. Bilateral cervical approaches were followed by hand-assisted laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy in the middle and lower mediastinum. Tumors were mainly located in the middle thoracic esophagus (n = 33), and most tumors were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 58). Pretreatment diagnoses were stage I, 19; II, 13; III, 24; IV, 4. Preoperative chemotherapy was performed for 40 patients. The median operation time and blood loss were 363 minutes and 235 mL, respectively.

RESULT: Of 30 patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and COVID-19, 13 patients(43.4%) had new-onset epileptic seizures without an epilepsy history(new-onset seizure group, NS group), ten patients(33.3%) had an epilepsy history with a recurrent epileptic seizure (recurrent seizure group, RS group) and seven patients(23.3%) had an epilepsy history but no seizure during the course of COVID-19 (epilepsy history group, EH group). Patients in the RS group had a larger number of other-neurological-disease histories than those in the NS and EH groups (7/10[70%] VS 1/13 [7.7%] VS 1/7[14.3%]); the difference between the RS group and NS group is significant (P < 0.05). Patients in the NE and RS groups suffered more severe/critical COVID-19 infection than patients in the EH group (10/13[76.9%] VS 6/10[60%] VS 1/7[14.3%]); the difference between the NS group and EH group is significant (P < 0.05). 36.7% of patients had one to five neurological complications, and 46.4% of patients had 6-10 neurological complications. The complications in patients with seizures (in the RS and NS groups) seem to be more than those without seizures (in the EH group), but it did not reach statistical significance. The proportion of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) treatment before admission was higher in the EH group than in the RE group(7/7 [100%] VS 2/10 [20%], P < 0.05). The mortality of 30 patients with epilepsy and COVID-19 was 36.67%. The mortality of the NS group(38.5%) and the RS group(50%) were a little higher than in the EH group(14.3%). None of the convalescent patients had a recurrent seizure, and there were no more deaths in the 3-month follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with recurrent epileptic seizures had more underlying neurological diseases than patients who had an epilepsy history but without a seizure. Patients with new-onset and recurrent epileptic seizures suffered more severe/critical COVID-19, which may lead to a worse prognosis. If patients with epilepsy history continue using AEDs during COVID-19 pandemics, the risk of recurrent seizure may be reduced, and a good prognosis for patients with epilepsy history could be expected.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 30 COVID-19 patients with epilepsy: A retrospective study in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Absorbents used in closed and semi-closed circuit environments play a key role in preventing carbon dioxide poisoning.

Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA. Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. Conclusions: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples.

Whereas timely glaucoma screening-based treatment can save the patient from complete vision loss. Accurate screening procedures are dependent on the availability of human experts who performs the manual analysis of retinal samples to identify the glaucomatous-affected regions. However, due to complex glaucoma screening procedures and shortage of human resources, we often face delays which can increase the vision loss ratio around the globe. To cope with the challenges of manual systems, there is an urgent demand for designing an effective automated framework that can accurately identify the Optic Disc (OD) and Optic Cup (OC) lesions at the earliest stage. Efficient and effective identification and classification of glaucomatous regions is a complicated job due to the wide variations in the mass, shade, orientation, and shapes of lesions. Furthermore, the extensive similarity between the lesion and eye color further complicates the classification process. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we have presented a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach namely EfficientDet-D0 with EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone. The presented framework comprises three steps for glaucoma localization and classification. Initially, the deep features from the suspected samples are computed with the EfficientNet-B0 feature extractor. Then, the Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) module of EfficientDet-D0 takes the computed features from the EfficientNet-B0 and performs the top-down and bottom-up keypoints fusion several times. In the last step, the resultant localized area containing glaucoma lesion with associated class is predicted. We have confirmed the robustness of our work by evaluating it on a challenging dataset namely an online retinal fundus image database for glaucoma analysis (ORIGA). Furthermore, we have performed cross-dataset validation on the High-Resolution Fundus (HRF), and Retinal Image database for Optic Nerve Evaluation (RIM ONE DL) datasets to show the generalization ability of our work.

RESULTS: We identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled. Thirteen studies investigated international measures, while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Wuhan measures reduced the number of cases exported internationally by 70%-80% and led to important reductions in transmission within Mainland China. Additional travel measures, including flight restrictions to and from China, may have led to additional reductions in the number of exported cases. Few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures did not account for domestic travel measures thus likely leading to biased estimates. CONCLUSION: Travel measures played an important role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We hypothesised that stability prior to discharge would reduce readmission to inpatient services within 90 days.BackgroundEarly readmission to inpatient psychiatric services is a poor outcome for service users, staff and the healthcare system. A variety of clinical, demographic and system factors, mostly non-modifiable, have been investigated previously. The identification of pre-discharge and particularly modifiable factors associated with readmission would give an opportunity for intervention and changes in policy.Method272 medical records of all admissions within an 8 month period to a NHS inner city psychiatric inpatient service were reviewed to identify factors associated with readmission within 90 days of discharge. The data were analysed by simple comparison, calculation of odds ratios and logistic regression.Result26% of service users were readmitted to the mental health trust within 90 days of discharge. Incidents (OR = 3.86;95% CI 1.39C10.75) and psychotropic medication change in the week before discharge (OR = 2.94;95% CI 1.43C6.03) were significantly associated with readmission, as were the number of previous admissions, and comorbid substance misuse. Successful overnight leave was found to be significantly protective against readmission (OR = 0.29;95% CI 0.11C0.72).ConclusionThe ability to predict those at high risk for readmission means they can be targeted for interventions and it can also help develop best practice around inpatient care and the discharge process.

METHODS: Four databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest, and Web of Science Core Collections) were searched in April 2020 using keywords relating to SARS-CoV, physical function, fitness, and exercise. Observational studies or randomized controlled trials were included if they involved people following SARS-CoV infection and either assessed the change or recovery in physical function/fitness or evaluated the effects exercise postinfection. RESULTS: A total 10 articles were included in this review. Evidence from 9 articles demonstrated that SARS-CoV patients had reduced levels of physical function and fitness postinfection compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, patients demonstrated incomplete recovery of physical function, with some experiencing residual impairments 1 to 2 years postinfection. Evidence from 1 randomized controlled trial found that a combined aerobic and resistance training intervention significantly improved physical function and fitness postinfection compared with a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Physical function and fitness are impaired following SARS-CoV infection, and impairments may persist up to 1 to 2 years postinfection. Researchers and clinicians can use these findings to understand the potential impairments and rehabilitation needs of people recovering from the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. While 1 study demonstrated that exercise can improve physical function and fitness postinfection, further research is required to determine the effectiveness of exercise in people recovering from similar infections (eg, COVID-19). IMPACT: Considering the similarities in pathology and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV and COVID-19, it is likely that COVID-19 patients will present with similar impairments to physical function. Accordingly, research is required to measure the extent of functional impairments in COVID-19 cohorts.

Here, one of these proteins, called 7b (206 residues), was investigated using a reverse genetic approach established for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79C1146. Recombinant FIPVs (rFPIVs) expressing mutant and/or FLAG-tagged forms of 7b were generated and used to investigate the expression, processing, glycosylation, localization and trafficking of the 7b protein in rFIPV-infected cells, focusing on a previously predicted ER retention signal, KTEL, at the C-terminus of 7b. The study revealed that 7b is N-terminally processed by a cellular signalase. The cleavage site, 17-Ala|Thr-18, was unambiguously identified by N-terminal sequence analysis of a 7b processing product purified from rFIPV-infected cells. Based on this information, rFIPVs expressing FLAG-tagged 7b proteins were generated and the effects of substitutions in the C-terminal (202)KTEL(206) sequence were investigated. The data show that (i) 7b localizes to and is retained in the medial- and/or trans-Golgi compartment, (ii) the C-terminal KTEL sequence acts as a Golgi [rather than an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)] retention signal, (iii) minor changes in the KTEL motif (such as KTE, KTEV, or the addition of a C-terminal tag) abolish Golgi retention, resulting in relocalization and secretion of 7b, and (iv) a KTEL-to-KDEL replacement causes retention of 7b in the ER of rFIPV-infected feline cells.

Pathogenesis of male infertility is often associated with autoimmunity towards sperm antigens essential for fertilization. Antisperm autoantibodies (ASAs) have immobilizing and cytotoxic properties, impairing spermatogenesis, causing sperm agglutination, altering spermatozoa motility and acrosomal reaction, and thus preventing ovum fertilization. Infertility diagnosis requires a mandatory check for the ASAs. The concept of the bloodCtestis barrier is currently re-formulated, with an emphasis on informational paracrine and juxtacrine effects, rather than simple anatomical separation. The etiology of male infertility includes both autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases but equally develops through autoimmune links of pathogenesis. Varicocele commonly leads to infertility due to testicular ischemic damage, venous stasis, local hyperthermia, and hypoandrogenism. However, varicocelectomy can alter the bloodCtestis barrier, facilitating ASAs production as well. There are contradictory data on the role of ASAs in the pathogenesis of varicocele-related infertility. Infection and inflammation both promote ASAs production due to danger concept mechanisms and because of antigen mimicry. Systemic pro-autoimmune influences like hyperprolactinemia, hypoandrogenism, and hypothyroidism also facilitate ASAs production. The diagnostic value of various ASAs has not yet been clearly attributed, and their cut-levels have not been determined in sera nor in ejaculate.

Patients with severe bronchiolitis admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a referral tertiary hospital between September 2010 and June 2021 were included. Demographic data were collected. Viral laboratory-confirmation was carried out. Each season was analyzed and compared. The daily average temperature was collected. RESULTS: 1116 patients were recruited, 58.2% of them males. The median age was 49 days. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was isolated in 782 cases (70.1%). In April 2021, the first and only case of bronchiolitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 was identified. The pre- and post-pandemic periods were compared. There were statistically significant differences regarding: age, 47 vs. 73 days (p = 0.006), PICU and hospital length of stay (p = 0.024 and p = 0.001, respectively), and etiology (p = 0.031).

We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone.","output":"Intracellular ABCB1 as a Possible Mechanism to Explain the Synergistic Effect of Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin Combination in COVID-19 Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although technology-based learning (TB learning) has been accepted as an efficient educational tool in the field of dentistry, the evaluation of TB learning in non-prepared situations such as pandemics has not been fully investigated.

Students at final grade, with advanced computer skills and TB learning experience, showed higher satisfaction (OR: 3.031, 2.876, 3.644, respectively) and a more positive attitude (OR: 3.172, 3.035, 3.477, respectively) towards TB learning than those at earlier grades. Total evaluation scores for lecturers were higher amongst females (11.5  5.8) than males (9.9  7.2) as well as amongst participants at final grade (14.0  6.2), with advanced computer skills (13.8  6.1) and TB learning experience (16.2  6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Dental students demonstrated low-moderate satisfaction and positive attitude towards TB learning and the quality of material presented to them. Integrating TB learning into the dental education curriculum is an essential step in enhancing the acceptance of TB learning in the future.","output":"Evaluation of technology-based learning by dental students during the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much research has been done on the psycho-social consequences, especially for children, adolescents and families. In the long run, there is a large set of quantitative data available. However, these still seem to be not well understood. Theoretical classifications of the evidence also diagnostic tools still seem to be open. This paper elaborates a possible systematisation based on theoretical models of systemic self-organisation theories. This leads to a model for a comprehensive psycho-social child-in-environment diagnostic to map potential problem areas. Such a theoretical framing should enable both: a deeper understanding of the impact of pandemics on young people and hypotheses for intervention strategies in the context of pandemic management as well as in the context of diagnostic-systemic interventions in psycho-social working settings. In the coming months and years, it will be essential to be able to understand and describe psychosocial disabilities that have developed in the context of the pandemic in a differentiated way in order to establish targeted interventions.","output":"COVID-19 and mental health in children and adolescents: a diagnostic panel to map psycho-social consequences in the pandemic context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CXCR3 ligands were secreted by tissue fibroblasts and peripheral blood-derived mononuclear leukocytes in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Subsequent purification and identification revealed the presence of truncated CXCL11 variants missing up to 6 amino acids. In combination with CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, the metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN), identical to the myeloid cell marker CD13, rapidly processed CXCL11, but not CXCL8, to generate truncated CXCL11 forms. Truncated CXCL11 had reduced binding, signaling, and chemotactic properties for lymphocytes and CXCR3- or CXCR7-transfected cells. CD13/APN-truncated CXCL11 failed to induce an intracellular calcium increase but was still able to bind and desensitize CXCR3 for intact CXCL11 signaling. CXCL11 efficiently bound to CXCR7, but CXCL11 was not able to induce calcium signaling or ERK1/2 or Akt phosphorylation through CXCR7. CD26-truncated CXCL11 failed to attract lymphocytes but still inhibited microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) migration. However, further processing of CXCL11 by CD13 resulted in significant reduction of inhibition of HMVEC migration.

The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglets microbiome. Contigs matched Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10(6.42)C10(7.01) copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses.

We derive here an analytical expression for the effectiveness of contact-tracing app installation strategies in a SIR model on a given contact graph. We propose a decentralised heuristic to improve the effectiveness of contact tracing under fixed adoption rates, which targets a set of individuals to install contact-tracing apps, and can be easily implemented.

A range of pathways were identified that might in theory allow coronavirus transmission from an infected person to a non-infected person via communal or personal equipment fomites or both. Eighteen percent of potential fomite based interactions were found to be non-essential to play including all contact with another persons equipment. Six opportunities to interrupt the transmission pathway were identified, including the recommendation to screen participants for symptoms prior to play. Social distancing between participants and avoiding unnecessary surface contact provides two opportunities; firstly to avoid equipment exposure to infected respiratory droplets and secondly to avoid uninfected participants touching potential fomites. Hand sanitisation and equipment sanitisation provide two further opportunities by directly inactivating coronavirus. Preventing players from touching their mucosal membranes with their hands represents the sixth potential interruption. Whilst potential fomite transmission pathways were identified, evidence suggests that viral load will be substantially reduced during surface transfer.

However, the effectiveness of this medication in patients with burns remains uncertain. Accordingly, investigators sought to assess wound re-epithelialization in patients with second-degree burns after adding pirfenidone to usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING Single-center pilot, proof-of-concept, single-blind randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION Eight patients with second-degree burns were treated with occlusive hydrocolloid dressings and were randomly allocated to receive either no additional treatment or pirfenidone. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate wound healing between groups based on the thickness of the re-epithelialized epidermis at day 7. Secondary outcomes were to qualitatively assess the development of fibrotic tissue in the dermis, anomalies in the basal membrane, and the development of collagen fibers by histologic analysis. Liver and renal functions were measured daily to assess the overall safety of oral pirfenidone. MAIN RESULTS Patients treated with pirfenidone showed a remarkable improvement in wound re-epithelialization at day 7 (148.98  13.64 vs 119.27  15.55 m; P = .029; 95% confidence interval, 4.14-55.29).

Design/methodology/approach: The data are collected from listed firms in five markets that have experienced the second wave of COVID-19 contagion, namely the United States (US), Australia, China, Hong Kong and South Korea. The period of investigation in this study ranges from January 24 to August 28, 2020 to cover the first two COVID-19 waves in selected markets. The study estimates the research model by employing the ordinary least square method with fixed effects to control for the heterogeneity that may confound the empirical outcomes. Findings: The analysis reveals that firms with larger size and more cash reserves before the COVID-19 outbreak have better stock performance under the first wave;however, these advantages impede stock resilience during the second wave. Corporate governance practices significantly influence stock returns only in the first wave as their effects fade when the second wave emerges. The results also suggest that in economies with greater power distance, although stock price depreciation was milder in the first wave, it is more intense when new cases again surge after the first wave was contained. Practical implications: This paper provides practical implications for corporate managers, policymakers and governments concerning crisis management strategies for COVID-19 and future pandemics.

METHODS: Seventy-eight eyes of 78 consecutive patients diagnosed with MPH were studied. Quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters including central foveal thickness, parafoveal thickness, parafoveal inner and outer retinal thickness (PIRT and PORT), pseudohole depth, pseudohole diameter, and inner nuclear layer (INL) angulation were measured and the morphologic features of the inner retina (disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL)) and the photoreceptor layer (external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), interdigitation zone (IZ), and cotton ball sign) were determined. Associations between OCT parameters and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were analyzed. Based on the location of the inner margin of INL, all patients were divided into three stages and the mean comparison between the three stages was analyzed. RESULTS: PIRT (r = 0.6489; p < 0.0001) and pseudohole depth (r = 0.5266; p < 0.0001) had a statistically significant correlation with BCVA. Statistically significant visual acuity differences were found in eyes with DRIL (p < 0.001) and IZ disruption (p = 0.018), but not in ELM disruption (p = 0.916), EZ disruption (p = 0.581), and cotton ball sign (p = 0.075). According to the univariate and multivariate regression analyses, PIRT was associated with BCVA in both univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.002) regression analyses. Defect diameters of both ELM (p = 0.025) and IZ (p = 0.006) were associated with BCVA in univariate regression analysis, but not in multivariate regression analysis. INL angulation and the ratio of the IZ disruption was significantly different in the three groups. Stage 3 (95.8%) had significantly higher disrupted IZ ratio than stage 1 (40%) and stage 2 (65.5%).

Secondly, expression and deletion analyses of a dicistronic construct showed that translation of the 43 kDa protein was initiated by ribosome internal entry mechanism.

Our aim was to determine whether the administration of adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC) is safe and potentially useful in these patients. METHODS: Thirteen COVID-19 adult patients under invasive mechanical ventilation who had received previous antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory treatments (including steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and/or tocilizumab, among others) were treated with allogeneic AT-MSC. Ten patients received two doses, with the second dose administered a median of 3 days (interquartile range-IQR- 1 day) after the first one. Two patients received a single dose and another patient received 3 doses. Median number of cells per dose was 0.98  10(6) (IQR 0.50  10(6)) AT-MSC/kg of recipient's body weight. Potential adverse effects related to cell infusion and clinical outcome were assessed. Additional parameters analyzed included changes in imaging, analytical and inflammatory parameters. FINDINGS: First dose of AT-MSC was administered at a median of 7 days (IQR 12 days) after mechanical ventilation. No adverse events were related to cell therapy. With a median follow-up of 16 days (IQR 9 days) after the first dose, clinical improvement was observed in nine patients (70%). Seven patients were extubated and discharged from ICU while four patients remained intubated (two with an improvement in their ventilatory and radiological parameters and two in stable condition). Two patients died (one due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to MSC therapy). Treatment with AT-MSC was followed by a decrease in inflammatory parameters (reduction in C-reactive protein, IL-6, ferritin, LDH and d-dimer) as well as an increase in lymphocytes, particularly in those patients with clinical improvement.

Areas covered: This review highlights the drug-drug interactions between antiepileptics and aminophylline, some antidepressant, antiarrhythmic (class I - IV), selected antihypertensive drugs and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics (ketamine, propofol, etomidate, and alphaxalone). The data were reviewed mainly from experimental models of seizures. Whenever possible, clinical data were provided. PUBMED data base was the main search source. Expert opinion: Aminophylline generally reduced the protective activity of antiepileptics, which, to a certain degree, was consistent with scarce clinical data on methylxanthine derivatives and worse seizure control. The only antiarrhythmic with this profile of action was mexiletine when co-administered with VPA. Among antidepressants and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics, trazodone, mianserin and etomidate or alphaxalone, respectively, negatively affected the anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs. Clinical data indicate that only amoxapine, bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline should be used with caution.

This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 M, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 M, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 M), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 M at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients.

Data from the interviews was analyzed using a constructivist thematic analysis method, guided by an intersectional theoretical scaffold. Three themes were identified related to systemic barriers, mental health, system navigation and self-care, and collected under the overarching theme of facing the unknown with dementia. Results emphasized the value and notable absence of community driven, culturally specific dementia programs, resources and navigators for people living with dementia, family caregivers and care workers of African descent. Participants identified lack of health system and care provider knowledge and understanding of the cultures and histories of people of African descent as a barrier to quality care and to addressing dementia-related stigma. Conversations focused on the need for practical and accessible tools, strategies and perspectives responsive to the actually lived realities and needs of people in community, and for research that actually contributes to individual and collective life in tangible, timely and culturally meaningful ways.

Screening also results in considerable overtreatment because many CIN2/3 lesions show spontaneous regression when left untreated. In this multicenter longitudinal cohort study of women with untreated CIN2/3, the prognostic value of FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation was evaluated for clinical regression. PATIENTS AND METHODS Women with CIN2/3 were prospectively followed for 24 months. Surgical excision was replaced by a wait-and-see policy. FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation was evaluated on all clinician-collected samples and self-collected samples collected at baseline. Every 6 months, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology were conducted on a clinician-collected sample, and a colposcopic examination was performed by a gynecologist to exclude progression. At the final study visit, two biopsies were taken. Clinical regression was defined as histologically confirmed absence of CIN2+ or an HPV-negative clinician-collected sample with normal cytology. Regression incidences were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS One hundred fourteen women (median age, 30 years; range, 20-53 years) were included, 80 of whom were diagnosed with CIN2 and 34 with CIN3. During the study, 65.8% of women (75/114) did not receive surgical treatment. Women with a negative FAM19A4/miR124-2 result on the baseline clinician-collected sample showed more clinical regression (74.7%) than women with a positive methylation result (51.4%, P = .013). Regression in women with a negative FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation test was highest when cytology was atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (88.4%) or HPV16 was negative (85.1%). CONCLUSION Most women with untreated CIN2/3 and a negative baseline FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation test showed clinical regression. Methylation, in combination with cytology or HPV genotyping, can be used to support a wait-and-see policy in women with CIN2/3.","output":"Clinical Regression of High-Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Is Associated With Absence of FAM19A4/miR124-2 DNA Methylation (CONCERVE Study)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Processed electroencephalography (pEEG) is widely used in clinical practice.

During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spreadlinear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. Although this study did not provide a definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv, we believe the findings justify additional research to investigate this potential mechanism of transmission.","output":"A Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Outbreak in One Geographic Region of the United States: Descriptive Epidemiology and Investigation of the Possibility of Airborne Virus Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an extraordinary challenge to public health and the world of work.

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","output":"Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, deep generative models for graphs have been used to generate new molecules.

Here, we report lesions and distribution of influenza virus antigen in 3 cats infected naturally with HPAIV H5N1 A/swan/Germany/R65/06. The hemagglutinin partial nucleotide sequences of the viruses were genetically closely related to a H5N1 HPAIV obtained from a dead Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) of the same area. At necropsy, within the patchy dark-red and consolidated lungs, there was granulomatous pneumonia caused by Aelurostrongylus sp. Histologically, the main findings associated with influenza in all cats were bronchointerstitial pneumonia and marked random hepatic necrosis. In addition, all animals displayed lymphoid necrosis in the spleen and Peyer's patches and necrosis of the adrenal cortex. Immunohistochemically, nucleoprotein of HPAIV was present intralesionally in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands, and lymphoid tissues. Oropharyngeal swabs were shown to be suited to detect HPAIV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cats, despite the paucity of influenza virus antigen in the upper respiratory tract by means of immunohistochemistry. The results show that outdoor cats in areas affected by HPAIV in wild birds are at risk for lethal infection.

Prevalence estimates of moderate to severe levels of clinically impairing symptoms of anxiety and depression revealed high but reduced occurrence four months into the pandemic where social distancing protocols were substantially lightened in severity, revealing associations between symptoms and viral mitigation protocols after stringent control of plausible confounders. In risk subgroups at the onset of the pandemic sustained their relative position compared to their counterparts four months into the pandemic, indicating prolonged suffering of these subgroups. Among mechanistic processes, key differences were identified regarding the trajectory of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Physical exercise was associated with long-term but not momentaneous alleviations in anxiety. In contrast, reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with both the simultaneous exertion as well as dose-increases in exercise over time. Increased knowledge about how to best cope with pandemic challenges was associated with greater improvement in depressive but not anxiety symptoms. Reductions in maladaptive coping strategies and negative metacognitive beliefs was substantially associated with greater improvement of both anxious and depressive symptomatology. Mechanistic processes divergently relate to the trajectory of depressive and anxious symptomatology, yielding domain-specific information of utility for preventive and interventive efforts aimed at impeding deleterious symptom levels.","output":"Mechanisms associated with the trajectory of depressive and anxiety symptoms: A linear mixed-effects model during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 14, 2020, New York City (NYC) has started the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the shortage of vaccines is currently an inevitable problem. Therefore, optimizing the age-specific COVID-19 vaccination is an important issue that needs to be addressed as a priority. OBJECTIVE: Combined with the reported COVID-19 data in NYC, this study aimed to construct a mathematical model with five age groups to estimate the impact of age-specific vaccination on reducing the prevalence of COVID-19. METHODS: We proposed an age-structured mathematical model and estimated the unknown parameters based on the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We also calibrated our model by using three different types of reported COVID-19 data in NYC. Moreover, we evaluated the reduced cumulative number of deaths and new infections with different vaccine allocation strategies. RESULTS: Compared with the current vaccination strategy in NYC, if we gradually increased the vaccination coverage rate for only one age groups from March 1, 2021 such that the vaccination coverage rate would reach to 40% by June 1, 2021, then as of June 1, 2021, the cumulative deaths in the 75C100 age group would be reduced the most, about 72 fewer deaths per increased 100,000 vaccinated individuals, and the cumulative new infections in the 0C17 age group would be reduced the most, about 21,591 fewer new infections per increased 100,000 vaccinated individuals. If we gradually increased the vaccination coverage rate for two age groups from March 1, 2021 such that the vaccination coverage rate would reach to 40% by June 1, 2021, then as of June 1, 2021, the cumulative deaths in the 65C100 age group would be reduced the most, about 36 fewer deaths per increased 100,000 vaccinated individuals, and the cumulative new infections in the 0C44 age group would be reduced the most, about 17,515 fewer new infections per increased 100,000 vaccinated individuals. In addition, if we had an additional 100,000 doses of vaccine for 0C17 and 75C100 age groups as of June 1, 2021, then the allocation of 80% to the 0C17 age group and 20% to the 75C100 age group would reduce the maximum numbers of new infections and deaths simultaneously in NYC.

The current drugs for treating neuropathies have limited efficacies or show important side effects, and the development of analgesics with novel modes of action is critical. The identification of endogenous anti-nociceptive factors has emerged as an attractive strategy for designing new pharmacological approaches to treat neuropathic pain. Cortistatin is a neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory activity, recently identified as a natural analgesic peptide in several models of pain evoked by inflammatory conditions. Here, we investigated the potential analgesic effect of cortistatin in neuropathic pain using a variety of experimental models of peripheral nerve injury caused by chronic constriction or partial transection of the sciatic nerve or by diabetic neuropathy. We found that the peripheral and central injection of cortistatin ameliorated hyperalgesia and allodynia, two of the dominant clinical manifestations of chronic neuropathic pain. Cortistatin-induced analgesia was multitargeted, as it regulated the nerve damage-induced hypersensitization of primary nociceptors, inhibited neuroinflammatory responses, and enhanced the production of neurotrophic factors both at the peripheral and central levels. We also demonstrated the neuroregenerative/protective capacity of cortistatin in a model of severe peripheral nerve transection. Interestingly, the nociceptive system responded to nerve injury by secreting cortistatin, and a deficiency in cortistatin exacerbated the neuropathic pain responses and peripheral nerve dysfunction. Therefore, cortistatin-based therapies emerge as attractive alternatives for treating chronic neuropathic pain of different etiologies.","output":"The Neuropeptide Cortistatin Alleviates Neuropathic Pain in Experimental Models of Peripheral Nerve Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For almost a year now, due to the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, engineering studies at all universities have been organized remotely.

Current methods of selecting PEEP only provide a range of values and do not provide unique patient-specific solutions. Model-based methods offer a novel way of using non-invasive pressure-volume (PV) measurements to estimate patient recruitability. This paper examines the clinical viability of such models in pilot clinical trials to assist therapy, optimise patient-specific PEEP, assess the disease state and response over time. METHODS Ten patients with acute lung injury or ARDS underwent incremental PEEP recruitment manoeuvres. PV data was measured at increments of 5 cmH2O and fitted to the recruitment model. Inspiratory and expiratory breath holds were performed to measure airway resistance and auto-PEEP. Three model-based metrics are used to optimise PEEP based on opening pressures, closing pressures and net recruitment. ARDS status was assessed by model parameters capturing recruitment and compliance. RESULTS Median model fitting error across all patients for inflation and deflation was 2.8% and 1.02% respectively with all patients experiencing auto-PEEP. In all three metrics' cases, model-based optimal PEEP was higher than clinically selected PEEP. Two patients underwent multiple recruitment manoeuvres over time and model metrics reflected and tracked the state or their ARDS.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), and ferritin (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock.

Mediation and moderated mediation models were run to explore the association between parent neuroticism and parent distress, mediated by child hyperactivity-inattention and child emotional symptoms, and the moderating effect of living only with child(ren) on the direct and indirect effects of parent neuroticism on parent distress. For parents living only with child(ren), high levels of psychological distress depended exclusively on their levels of neuroticism. For parents living with at least one other person in addition to child(ren), distress levels were also mediated by child behavioral and emotional difficulties. Motherhood emerged as a significant factor contributing to greater distress. Furthermore, parent psychological distress decreased in line with increased child age. The results confirm that neuroticism is an important risk factor for mental health. Preventive measures should be primarily target multicomponent families with younger children and directed towards parents who are already known to present emotional instability and to parents of children who have received local mental health assistance for behavioral and/or emotional difficulties.","output":"How Personality Relates to Distress in Parents during the Covid-19 Lockdown: The Mediating Role of Child's Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties and the Moderating Effect of Living with Other People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In COVID-19 times, the healthcare system needs more financial and other resources for covering all necessary medical products and services.

Recent studies have revealed that thyroid function is closely related to ACS. However, only a few reports of thyrotoxicosis-induced ACS with severe atherosclerosis have been reported. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old man, who had a history of hyperthyroidism without taking any antithyroid drugs and no history of coronary heart disease, experienced neck pain with occasional heart palpitations starting 3 mo prior that were aggravated after an activity. As the symptoms worsened at 21 d prior, he went to a hospital for treatment. The electrocardiogram examination showed a multilead ST segment elevation and pathological Q waves. Based on these findings and his symptoms, the patient was diagnosed with a suspected myocardial infarction and transferred to our hospital on July 2, 2020. He was diagnosed with a rare case of ACS due to coronary artery atherosclerosis in the anterior descending artery complicated by hyperthyroidism. A paclitaxel-coated drug balloon was used for treatment to avoid the use of metal stents, thus reducing the time of antiplatelet therapy and facilitating the continued treatment of hyperthyroidism. The 9-mo follow-up showed favorable results. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that atherosclerosis is a cause of ACS that cannot be ignored even in a patient with hyperthyroidism.","output":"Acute coronary syndrome with severe atherosclerotic and hyperthyroidism: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how COVID-19 has affected the authors management accounting teaching and research Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a reflection essay on management accounting Findings: The author realized that the textbooks, because of the lack of integration among management accounting techniques, do not prepare the students with the ability to make the quick changes required by COVID-19 The author expects that they will have to introduce integration to the management accounting textbooks and courses Qualitative research will be helpful in identifying the management accounting techniques now integrated in practice The author further expects the beneficial practices that were learned from online and remote teaching during the pandemic will be with them into the future Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited as it is a personal reflection Practical implications: COVID-19 has required organizations be increasingly agile, particularly in the use of budgets and other management accounting techniques Social implications: Opportunities are identified for improving the teaching and use of management accounting, especially regarding strategy and budgeting Originality/value: The extreme nature of pandemics intensifies the observations of the functioning of disciplines such as management accounting Everyone learns from extreme experiences ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Ramifications of Covid-19 on management accounting teaching and research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore attitudes of medical students following a course in integrative medicine (IM) focused on palliative and supportive cancer.

Furthermore, statistical, logical and visualization methods were also incorporated. Findings: It is shown that if initially Chinese investors invested in almost all the industries and sectors in which they were interested in, ranging from the extractive industry to the entertainment industry (e.g. purchase of sports clubs), nowadays Chinese investment policy has become more specialized only in some sectors. Today, China is primarily interested in high-tech industries. As a result, the main goal of Chinese investors is to acquire leading European and American companies engaged in these industries.

In addition, it seems that rearing conditions have important impact on emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Thus, the authors sought to 1.) assess the role of rabbits residing across diverse ecosystems as potential reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci and 2.) investigate the genetic background of detected resistances. METHODS AND RESULTS Faecal samples from 60 healthy farmed rabbits (one farm), 35 laboratory rabbits, and 31 wild rabbits were analyzed. Overall, 97 enterococci isolates were accumulated, as follows: 44 E. faecium, 37 E. faecalis, 7 E. gallinarum, 5 E. durans, and 4 E. avium. E. faecalis isolates were statistically associated with farm rabbits and wild rabbits (P < 0.05). High rates of resistance were observed for tetracycline [60.8%; tetM (n = 48; 81.3%), tetO (n = 7; 11.8%), and tetL (n = 1; 1.7%)], erythromycin [43.3%; msr(A) (n = 14; 33.3%) and ermB (n = 13; 31%)], ampicillin [29.9%], streptomycin [26.8%; ant(6)-Ia (n = 3, 11.5%)] , and vancomycin [21.6%; vanA (one E. faecium + one E. faecalis; 9.5%)]. Low frequencies of resistance were observed for teicoplanin [9.2%], linezolid [8.2%], ciprofloxacin [7.2%], and gentamicin [1%; aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\\")-Ia]. Resistance to ampicillin, and vancomycin was associated with laboratory rabbits (P < 0.05). Int-Tn (Tn916/1545) was detected in 27 (27.8%) isolates, of which ten isolates co-harbored tetM and ermB genes, while 16 comprised tetM. CONCLUSION Findings indicate that clinically relevant enterococci species isolated from rabbits are frequently resistant to antimicrobials and harbor a range of genes associated with the Tn916/1545 family.

MethodsWe included 23 primary studies in undergraduate education, all published in 2020-2021, no relevant UK-based or postgraduate studies were found. Included studies comprised 10 single cohort descriptive; 11 comparative descriptive; and two RCTs. There was considerable variability in terms of students, type of distance learning, platforms used and outcome measures. ResultsIn medicine (n=14), self-reported competency and confidence, and demonstrable suturing skills were achieved through participating in remote learning. However, lower levels of knowledge were obtained by students who received virtual or blended learning compared to in-person teaching (low-very low confidence). Using bespoke interactive platforms in undergraduate medical training was superior to standard video (low confidence) or textbook presentations (very low confidence). In dentistry (n=2), remote learning led to knowledge gained (low confidence), but self-reported practical and interpersonal skills were lower with remote rather than in-person learning (very low confidence). In nursing (n=3), remote learning, when compared to in-person, resulted in similar knowledge and self-reported competency levels (very low confidence) pre-COVID, but confidence was higher when learning or assessment was conducted virtually (low confidence). In pharmacy (n=4), virtual learning was associated with higher skills, but lower knowledge compared to in-person, pre-COVID; self-reported competency and confidence scores were similar between the two groups (very low confidence). ConclusionsRemote teaching was valued, and learning was achieved, but the comparative effectiveness of virtual versus in-person teaching is less clear.

It has been documented that severe COVID-19 is associated with higher levels of inflammatory mediators than a mild disease, and tracking these markers may allow early identification or even prediction of disease progression. It is well known that C-reactive protein (CRP) is the acute-phase protein and the active regulator of host innate immunity, which is highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation and may guide escalation of treatment of COVID-19-related uncontrolled inflammation. There are numerous causes of an elevated CRP, including acute and chronic responses, and these can be infectious or non-infectious in etiology. CRP are normally lacking in viral infections, while adaptive immunity appears to be essential for COVID-19 virus clearance, and the macrophage activation syndrome may explain the high serum CRP contents and contribute to the disease progression.

We discuss our experience with the introduction of droplet precautions on-site (DroPS) as a possible alternative. METHODS: During the 2018/19 influenza season we introduced DroPS on several wards of a single tertiary care center, while other wards maintained the traditional single room isolation strategy. On a daily basis, we evaluated patients for the development of respiratory symptoms and screened those with a clinical diagnosis of hospital-acquired respiratory viral infection (HARVI) for influenza/RSV by molecular rapid test. If negative, it was followed by a multiplex respiratory virus PCR. We report the concept of DroPS, the feasibility of the strategy and the rate of microbiologically confirmed HARVI with influenza or RSV infection on the DroPS wards compared to wards using the traditional single room isolation strategy. RESULTS: We evaluated all hospitalised patients at risk for a HARVI, 741 (72%) on the DroPS wards and 293 (28%) on the regular wards. The hospital-acquired infection rate with influenza or RSV was 2/741 (0.3%; 1 influenza A, 1 RSV) on the DroPS wards and 2/293 (0.7%; 2 influenza A) on the regular wards.

The economic valuation is based on the combination of the significant bottom-up European studies which follow the impact pathway approach (IPA) to calculating costs from transport air emissions. Our results showed higher total external costs for Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (74.4 m), followed by Tenerife (20 m), Palma de Mallorca (19.5 m) and Pasaia (1.5 m). The external costs by shipping subsectors give more insights into the relationships between ship types and external costs. This has been done to correctly assign the responsibilities among the different shipping sectors inside a port and to better understand the potential benefits of implementing abatement technologies, such as cold ironing.

We aim to identify the effect of school openings on the spread of COVID-19 contagion. Italy offers an interesting quasi-experimental setting in this regard due to the scattered openings that schools have experienced. By means of a quantitative analysis, employing a synthetic control method approach, we find that Bolzano, the first province in Italy to open schools after the summer break, had far more cases than its synthetic counterfactual, built from a donor pool formed from the other Italian provinces.

This article describes the results of a survey of 295 psychologists and psychiatrists concerning their experiences and opinions of forensic tele-service work. Participants identified a range of benefits to using audiovisual (AV) conferencing technologies, including efficiency, convenience, ease of access, safety, client comfort, and flexibility. However, issues were also reported, including concerns that some aspects of the mental status examination, specifically appearance and behavior and affect, may be difficult to assess. There were also some clinical conditions that were considered by participants to be unsuitable for tele-servicing. Although most participants believed that the therapeutic relationship was less satisfactory when using AV conferencing as compared with face-to-face interactions, on average, participants were satisfied with the therapeutic relationship that was developed. Further, some participants (n = 38, 27.1%) reported that clients had expressed a preference for remote engagement, but a similar number reported that some had expressed concerns about receiving treatment remotely (n = 38, 26.4%). Although recent training and experience were associated with confidence, perceived confidence, and satisfaction with tele-services, fewer than half of participants (n = 112, 44.8%) had received training in tele-service use. Overall, there appears to be a range of benefits to using tele-services for remote forensic assessment and treatment practice, but there are issues that need to be considered, and best-practice guidelines require development.

Future movers and shakers of our world are losing their valuable time due to the disruptions caused by this pandemic. Cannot they continue their learning activities from wherever they are? Technology provides teachers and students with several means to access a variety of educational resources. There has also been considerable growth in the adoption of technology within educational institutions in recent years. The world is standing on the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution, which is based on information and communication technologies. In keeping with this modern trend, data collection was done through the distribution of an online questionnaire among first-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Moratuwa (UoM) in Sri Lanka during 2017, 2018 and 2019. When preparing the online questionnaire, questions were taken from the Kirkwood & Price TEL Handbook. Results indicated that all the respondents were computer literate and of them, 80% owned computers at home. Therefore, higher educational institutions can arrange to take advantage of these capabilities to enhance the students learning by encouraging them to adopt collaborative learning methods. Further, this study shows that more than 95% of them access the Internet by using a smartphone, and as such, higher education institutions can arrange to exploit mobile technologies for engineering education, thereby delivering the maximum benefits to students.

Antimonene is used here as bio-recognition element (BRE) layer to attach the Hb analyte through physical adsorption due to its hydrophilic nature, higher adsorption energy and larger active surface area. The use of BaTiO(3) adlayer (7 nm) just before antimonene is to enhance the refractive index (RI) sensitivity up to 1.90 times for the proposed SPR biosensor. The reason behind sensitivity enhancement is its high dielectric constant which enhances the electromagnetic field with in analyte medium. The performance of the biosensor is demonstrated with performance parameters namely sensitivity, detection accuracy (DA), figure of merit (FOM) and resolution. The proposed biosensor has potential to achieve much higher performance in terms of RI sensitivity of 303.83/RIU, FOM of 50.39 RIU(?1) and resolution of 0.021 g/l in comparison with reported biosensors in the literature for detection of Hb concentration.

Due to the steroid intake, the COVID-19 virus is present in the patient's gastrointestinal tract for extended period of time. It may therefore increase the possibility of PI in such patients. It is usually asymptomatic, with a clinical spectrum ranging from indolent to life-threatening. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms concerning diagnosis and treatment of PI.

In addition to measurements typical of legacy neuropsychological tests, Miro also quantifies functions that are currently left to subjective clinical impressions such as motor function, language, and speech. Objective: Studies were conducted to measure Miro's concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and amnestic MCI classification performance. Method: Spearman correlations were calculated to estimate the concurrent validity of Miro and legacy variables using data from 207 study participants. Twenty-six healthy controls were assessed at three time points to evaluate the test-retest reliability of Miro test scores. Reliability was quantified with the scores' intraclass correlations. Learning effects were measured as trends over three assessments. A machine learning algorithm combined Miro scores into a risk score to distinguish 65 healthy controls, 21 amnestic MCI (aMCI) participants, and 17 non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) participants. Results: Significant correlations of Miro variables with legacy neuropsychological test variables were observed. Longitudinal studies show agreement of subsequent measurements and minimal learning effects. The Risk Score distinguished aMCI from healthy controls with an Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) of 0.97; the naMCI participants and controls were separated with an AUROC of 0.80, and the combined (aMCI + naMCI) group was separated from healthy controls with an AUROC of 0.89.

Communal screening of air in a highly crowded space has the potential to provide early warning on the presence and potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by studies early in the epidemic. As hospitals and public facilities apply varying degrees of restrictions and regulations, it is important to provide multiple methodological options to enable environmental SARS-CoV-2 surveillance under different conditions. This study assessed the feasibility of using high-flowrate air samplers combined with RNA extraction kit designed for environmental sample to perform airborne SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in hospital setting, tested by RT-qPCR. The success rate of the air samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was then compared with surface swab samples collected in the same proximity. Additionally, positive RT-qPCR samples underwent viral culture to assess the viability of the sampled SARS-CoV-2. The study was performed in inpatient ward environments of a quaternary care university teaching hospital in Singapore housing active COVID-19 patients within the period of February to May 2020. Two types of wards were tested, naturally ventilated open-cohort ward and mechanically ventilated isolation ward. Distances between the site of air sampling and the patient cluster in the investigated wards were also recorded. No successful detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 was recorded when 50 L/min air samplers were used. Upon increasing the sampling flowrate to 150 L/min, our results showed a high success rate in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from the air samples (72%) compared to the surface swab samples (9.6%). The positive detection rate of the air samples along with the corresponding viral load could be associated with the distance between sampling site and patient. The furthest distance from patient with PCR-positive air samples was 5.5 m. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 detection was comparable between the two types of wards with 60%?87.5% success rate. High prevalence of the virus was found in toilet areas, both on surfaces and in air.

We provide tips, tricks, and pitfalls for educators to establish or improve similar programs. Method: From June 2020 monthly, in-person teaching was replaced with virtual sessions. Quantitative and qualitative feedback directed improvements in the program. In addition to knowledge-based lectures we integrated on-line learning tools (LapPass) and utilised surgical videos to ensure continued development of surgical skills. Mock MRCS and ST3 interviews were conducted remotely using 'break-out rooms. Where face-to-face teaching was essential (Boot Camp, Field Camp) safety was ensured with reduced numbers (split sessions), social distancing and appropriate PPE. Results: All trainees strongly agreed (67%) or agreed (33%) that virtual teaching works well. There were no significant differences in feedback scores compared with face-to-face teaching. Attendance increased by 42%. Interactivity was maintained with 'cameras on, mics off', polling apps and chat box function. Advantages include uploading webinars for future review, ability for educators to present from multiple locations, increased availability and breadth of speakers and reduced burden on clinical commitments.

METHODS: Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS: Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to develop effective, scalable, and rapidly deployable public health resources that target the stressors commonly experienced among young adults to improve their psychological wellbeing during this pandemic.","output":"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, mood, and substance use among young adults in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area: Findings from project EAT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are vital drivers of Chinas economy As in any other country, SMEs in China are exceptionally exposed to the devastating effects of the COVID-19 outbreak The aim of the paper is to assess the impact of the pandemic on SMEs in China and study the effectiveness of the governments support for SMEs through the crisis The methodologies applied by the authors included the historical and logical method, the method of the rising from the abstract to the concrete, synthesis, comparative factor analysis, grouping and graphical methods, as well as a systematic and statistical approach The authors investigate the main policies and initiatives launched in support of smaller businesses and implemented by the Peoples Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as well as by the two national regulatory authorities -- China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and China Securities Regulatory Commission In this paper the authors analyze the direct and indirect support available to SMEs through financial institutions The study leads to the conclusions that the state support for SMEs has been effective and helped to avoid a sharp decline in production However, the spread of the disease in other countries may threaten the recovery of the Chinese economy","output":"Financial Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in China Amid COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the causal agent for COVID-19, is a communicable disease spread through close contact. It is known to disproportionately impact certain communities due to both biological susceptibility and inequitable exposure. In this study, we investigate the most important health, social, and environmental factors impacting the early phases (before July, 2020) of per capita COVID-19 transmission and per capita all-cause mortality in US counties. We aggregate county-level physical and mental health, environmental pollution, access to health care, demographic characteristics, vulnerable population scores, and other epidemiological data to create a large feature set to analyze per capita COVID-19 outcomes. Because of the high-dimensionality, multicollinearity, and unknown interactions of the data, we use ensemble machine learning and marginal prediction methods to identify the most salient factors associated with several COVID-19 outbreak measure. Our variable importance results show that measures of ethnicity, public transportation and preventable diseases are the strongest predictors for both per capita COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Specifically, the CDC measures for minority populations, CDC measures for limited English, and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county were the most important features for per capita COVID-19 cases within a month after the pandemic started in a county and also at the latest date examined. For per capita all-cause mortality at day 100 and total to date, we find that public transportation use and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county are the strongest predictors. The methods predict that, keeping all other factors fixed, a 10% increase in public transportation use, all other factors remaining fixed at the observed values, is associated with increases mortality at day 100 of 2012 individuals (95% CI [1972, 2356]) and likewise a 10% increase in the proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county is associated with increases total deaths at end of study of 2067 (95% CI [1189, 2654]). Using data until the end of study, the same metric suggests ethnicity has double the association as the next most important factors, which are location, disease prevalence, and transit factors. Our findings shed light on societal patterns that have been reported and experienced in the U.S. by using robust methods to understand the features most responsible for transmission and sectors of society most vulnerable to infection and mortality. In particular, our results provide evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority populations.

They undergo asymmetric divisions to renew the stem cell lineage and to produce sibling cystoblasts that will in turn enter differentiation. GSCs and cystoblasts contain spectrosomes, membranous structures essential to orientate the mitotic spindle and that, particularly in GSCs, change shape depending on the cell cycle phase. Using live imaging and a GFP fusion of the spectrosome component Par-1, we follow the complete spectrosome cycle throughout GSC division and quantify the relative duration of the different spectrosome shapes. We also determine that the Par-1 kinase shuttles between the spectrosome and the cytoplasm during mitosis and observe the continuous addition of new material to the GSC and cystoblast spectrosomes. Next, we utilise the Fly-FUCCI tool to define in live and fixed tissues that GSCs have a shorter G1 compared to the G2 phase. The observation of centrosomes in dividing GSCs allowed us to determine that centrosomes separate very early in G1, prior to centriole duplication. Furthermore, we show that the anterior centrosome associates with the spectrosome only during mitosis and that, upon mitotic spindle assembly, it translocates to the cell cortex, where it remains anchored until centrosome separation. Finally, we demonstrate that the asymmetric division of GSCs is not an intrinsic property of these cells, since the spectrosome of GSC-like cells located outside of the niche can divide symmetrically. Thus, GSCs display unique properties during division, a behaviour influenced by the surrounding niche.","output":"Live imaging of the Drosophila ovarian niche shows spectrosome and centrosome dynamics during asymmetric germline stem cell division"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aims to review chest computed tomography (CT) scanning parameters which are utilized to evaluate patients for COVID-19-induced pneumonia.

MAIN BODY: Chest CT scan can play a key diagnostic role in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, it can be useful to monitor imaging changes during treatment. However, CT scan overuse during the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about radiation-induced adverse effects, both in patients and healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: By evaluating the CT scanning parameters used in several studies, one can find the necessity for optimizing these parameters. It has been found that chest CT scan taken using low-dose CT protocol is a reliable diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in daily practice. Moreover, the low-dose chest CT protocol results in a remarkable reduction (up to 89%) in the radiation dose compared to the standard-dose protocol, not lowering diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in CT images.

Here we report molecular and serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) actively circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Whole genome sequences were obtained from five independent bats (Rhinolophus acuminatus) in a Thai cave yielding a single isolate (named RacCS203) which is most related to the RmYN02 isolate found in Rhinolophus malayanus in Yunnan, China. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in bats of the same colony and in a pangolin at a wildlife checkpoint in Southern Thailand. Antisera raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of RmYN02 was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that the RBD of RacCS203 or RmYN02 failed to bind ACE2.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002).

We validated detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Sanger sequencing the PCR product from the S gene.

Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks.

SARS-CoV-2 is shed in stool early in the clinical course and infects a large asymptomatic population, making it an ideal target for wastewater-based monitoring. In this study, we develop a laboratory protocol to quantify viral titers in raw sewage via qPCR analysis and validate results with sequencing analysis. Our results suggest that the number of positive cases estimated from wastewater viral titers is orders of magnitude greater than the number of confirmed clinical cases and therefore may significantly impact efforts to understand the case fatality rate and progression of disease.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and infectious virus were analyzed relative to symptom onset stratified by vaccination status. We tested 1080 nasal specimens from 52 unvaccinated adults enrolled in the pre-Delta period and 32 fully vaccinated adults with predominantly Delta infections. While we observed no differences by vaccination status in maximum RNA levels, maximum infectious titers and the median duration of viral RNA shedding, the rate of decay from the maximum RNA load was faster among vaccinated; maximum infectious titers and maximum RNA levels were highly correlated. Furthermore, amongst participants with infectious virus, median duration of infectious virus detection was reduced from 7.5 days (IQR: 6.0-9.0) in unvaccinated participants to 6 days (IQR: 5.0-8.0) in those vaccinated (P=0.02). Accordingly, the odds of shedding infectious virus from days 6 to 12 post-onset were lower among vaccinated participants than unvaccinated participants (OR 0.42 95% CI 0.19-0.89).

The burden of so many patients and the lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds often force physicians to choose non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as the first approach, even if no consent has still been reached to discriminate whether it is safer to choose straightforward intubation, paralysis, and protective ventilation. Under such conditions, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), a non-invasive bedside tool to monitor lung ventilation and perfusion defects, could be useful to assess the response of patients to NIV and choose rapidly the right ventilatory strategy. Objective: The rationale behind this study is that derecruitment is a more efficient measure of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)-dependency of patients than recruitment. We hypothesized that patients who derecruit significantly when PEEP is reduced are the ones that do not need early intubation while small end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) variations after a single step of PEEP de-escalation could be predictive of NIV failure. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to ICU with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ventilated in NIV were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were former intubation or NIV lasting > 72 h. A trial of continuos positive airway pressure (CPAP) 12 was applied in every patient for at least 15 min, followed by the second period of CPAP 6, either in the supine or prone position. Besides standard monitoring, ventilation of patients was assessed by EIT, and end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) (%) was calculated as the difference in EELI between CPAP(12) and CPAP(6). Tidal volume (Vt), Ve, respiratory rate (RR), and FiO(2) were recorded, and ABGs were measured. Data were analyzed offline using the dedicated software. The decision to intubate or continue NIV was in charge of treating physicians, independently from study results. Outcomes of patients in terms of intubation rate and ICU mortality were recorded. Results: We enrolled 10 male patients, with a mean age of 67 years. Six patients (60%) were successfully treated by NIV until ICU discharge (Group S), and four patients failed NIV and were intubated and switched to MV (Group F). All these patients died in ICU. During the supine CPAP decremental trial, all patients experienced an increase in RR and Ve. EELI was < 40% in Group F and > 50% in Group S. In the prone trial, EELI was > 50% in all patients, while RR decreased in Group S and remained unchanged in Group F. Conclusion: EELI < 40% after a single PEEP de-escalation step in supine position seems to be a good predictor of poor recruitment and CPAP failure.","output":"A Pilot Study on Electrical Impedance Tomography During CPAP Trial in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pneumonia: The Bright Side of Non-invasive Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when health systems were overwhelmed with surging hospitalizations and a novel virus, many ambulatory patients diagnosed with COVID-19 lacked guidance and support as they convalesced at home.

Based on promising pre-clinical and clinical data, remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug to receive FDA approval and so far, it is the most common therapy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2/MERS-CoV. However, following intravenous administration, RDV metabolizes majorly by human liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and marginally by the CYP3A4 enzyme in merely less than an hour. Its resultant active metabolite is a hydrophilic nucleoside with very limited accumulation within lung tissues. Therefore, there is a need to investigate strategies to overcome such premature metabolism issues and improve the antiviral efficacy of RDV at the target site. Objective: Considering the major CES1-mediated metabolism of RDV on systemic administration, we intend to explore the remarkable CES1 plus CYP3A4 inhibitory activity of cannabidiol (CBD) against in vitro microsomal metabolism of RDV to indicate its therapeutic potential as an adjuvant to RDV in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Methods: We investigated the in vitro human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV in the presence of two potential CES1 inhibitors-CBD and nelfinavir, and two standard CYP3A4 inhibitors-ritonavir (RITO) and cyclosporin A. The microsomal metabolism assay was further validated by using a well-characterized CYP3A4-selective substrate, midazolam (MDZ), in the presence of CBD and RITO. Results: Our findings depicted that RDV was rapidly and completely metabolized by human liver microsomes within 60 min. Coincubation with CBD substantially reduced microsomal metabolism of RDV and prolonged its in vitro half-life from 8.93 to 31.07 min. CBD showed significantly higher inhibition of RDV compared with known CES1 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Inhibition of MDZ metabolism by CBD and RITO further validated the assay. Conclusions: The current study strongly suggests that CBD significantly inhibits human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV and extends its in vitro half-life. Thus, concomitant administration of CBD with RDV intravenous injection could be a promising strategy to prevent premature metabolism in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Cannabidiol Inhibits In Vitro Human Liver Microsomal Metabolism of Remdesivir: A Promising Adjuvant for COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected the social determinants of health, worsening health inequities and deteriorating healthcare capacities around the globe. The objective of this study is to investigate the COVID-19 prevention behaviors within the framework of the Health Belief Model in the city of Depalpur in the Okara District of Pakistan in May 2020. Using an observational, cross-sectional, and quantitative study design, a face-to-face field survey was conducted during the epidemic of COVID-19 in district Okara, Pakistan. A sample of 500 adults was selected from the city of Depalpur the in Okara district of Pakistan, using a two-stage sampling design with cluster sampling in stage one and systematic random sampling at stage two. A COVID-19 prevention behavior scale was computed based on twelve dichotomous items. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. The most common prevention behavior among study participants was avoiding going for walks in the parks (81.0%), followed by not leaving home during the lockdown (72.6%), and washing hands every day with soap and water for 20 s after going out of their home (64.0%). Fewer people exhibited prevention behaviors such as social distancing (e.g., staying at least six feet away from other people) which in the EU was recommended to be a minimum of 1.5C2 m (44.4%) and following all of the basic protective measures (e.g., hand washing, use of a face covering in public, social distancing) in order to protect against COVID-19 (33.0%). The results from the negative binomial regression analysis showed that after controlling for the other HBM constructs and sociodemographic factors, only the perceived benefits of preventative actions showed significant association with the prevention behavior scale (IRR, 1.16; CI, 1.061C1.276; p < 0.001).

The term emerging infectious disease was coined in the mid-1900s to describe changes in disease dynamics in the modern era. Both the term and the phenomena it is meant to characterize have evolved and diversified over time, leading to inconsistencies and confusion. Here, we review the evolution of the term emerging infectious disease (EID) in the literature as applied to human hosts. We examine the pathways (e.g., speciation or strain differentiation in the causative agent vs. rapid geographic expansion of an existing pathogen) by which diseases emerge. We propose a new framework for disease and pathogen emergence to improve prioritization. And we illustrate how the operational definition of an EID affects conclusions concerning the pathways by which diseases emerge and the ecological and socioeconomic drivers that elicit emergence. As EIDs appear to be increasing globally, and resources for science level off or decline, the research community is pushed to prioritize its focus on the most threatening diseases, riskiest potential pathogens, and the places they occur. The working definition of emerging infectious diseases and pathogens plays a crucial role in prioritization, but we argue that the current definitions may be impeding these efforts. We propose a new framework for classifying pathogens and diseases as emerging that distinguishes EIDs from emerging pathogens and novel potential pathogens. We suggest prioritization of: 1) EIDs for adaptation and mitigation, 2) emerging pathogens for preventive measures, and 3) novel potential pathogens for intensive surveillance.","output":"Redefining disease emergence to improve prioritization and macro-ecological analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ѧʶоĻѧ֮һĿǰͻ͹״ȾĲѧ֤в࣬ΪSARSߣعܽSARS̬ѧı䣬Ҳʶ¹ڲȾ.","output":"[How to understand the histopathology of SARS and COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, generalized social distancing measures, such as traffic control and travel restriction acted in China.

Isolation of the causative virus revealed a new porcine coronavirus, the origin of which has never been clarified. Pathogenesis studies with the prototype strain CV777 showed severe villous atrophy in neonatal pigs and the virus-animal interactions showed many similarities with transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV), another porcine coronavirus. Disease patterns in field outbreaks showed muchvariation but, while farm related factors played a role, possible genetic variations of virus strains in Europe have not been examined and are thus unknown. CV777 in experimental pigs caused diarrheal disease and mortality rates similar to those later encountered in Asia and more recently with the original US strains even though genomic typing of the prototype European strain have shown that it belongs to the S-INDEL strains. In Europe, PED has become endemic during the eighties and nineties and subsequently regressed so that, after 2000, swine populations in many countries have largely become seronegative.

Histone hypercitrullination is an important step in ETs formation and citrullinated histone H3 (H3cit) is considered a novel and specific biomarker of that process. In the present study we have evaluated circulating H3cit in stable asthmatics and investigated its relationship with asthma severity, pulmonary function and selected blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) biomarkers. METHODS: In 60 white adult stable asthmatics and 50 well-matched controls we measured serum levels of H3cit. In asthmatics we also performed bronchoscopy with BAL. We analyzed blood and BAL biomarkers, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A and interferon . For statistical analysis, MannCWhitney U-test, (2) test, one-way ANCOVA, ROC curve analysis and univariate linear regression were applied. Independent determinants of H3cit were established in a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: Asthma was characterized by elevated circulating H3cit (17.49 [11.25C22.58] vs. 13.66 [8.66C18.87] ng/ml, p = 0.03). In asthmatics positive associations were demonstrated between serum H3cit and lung function variables, including total lung capacity (TLC) ( = 0.37 [95% CI 0.24C0.50]) and residual volume ( = 0.38 [95% CI 0.25C0.51]). H3cit was increased in asthma patients receiving systemic steroids (p = 0.02), as well as in subjects with BAL eosinophilia above 144 cells/ml (p = 0.02). In asthmatics, but not in controls, circulating H3cit correlated well with number of neutrophils ( = 0.31 [95% CI 0.19C0.44]) and monocytes ( = 0.42 [95% CI 0.29C0.55]) in peripheral blood. Furthermore, BAL macrophages, BAL neutrophils, TLC, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Il-12p70 and bronchial obstruction degree were independent determinants of H3cit in a multivariate linear regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is characterized by increased circulating H3cit likely related to the enhanced lung ETs formation.

Objective: To assess design and implementation factors required to maximize enrollment and retention in a fully remote, longitudinal COVID-19 testing study. Design: Fully remote longitudinal study launched in October 2020 and ongoing; Study data reported through July 2021. Setting: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston MA Participants: Adults, 18 years or older, within 45 miles of Boston, MA. Intervention: Monthly and \\"on-demand\\" at-home SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing using nasal swab and dried blood spot self-collection kits and electronic surveys to assess symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19. Main Outcomes: Enrollment, retention, and lessons learned. Results: Between October 2020 and January 2021, we enrolled 10,289 participants reflective of Massachusetts census data. Mean age was 47 years (range 18-93), 5855 (56.9%) were assigned female sex at birth, 7181(69.8%) reported being White non-Hispanic, 952 (9.3%) Hispanic/Latinx, 925 (9.0%) Black, 889 (8.6%) Asian, and 342 (3.3%) other and/or more than one race. Lower initial enrollment among Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals required an adaptive approach, leveraging connections to the medical system, coupled with community partnerships to ensure a representative cohort. Longitudinal retention was higher among participants who were White non-Hispanic, older, working remotely, and with lower socioeconomic vulnerability. Considerable infrastructure, including a dedicated participant support team and robust technology platforms was required to reduce barriers to enrollment, promote retention, ensure scientific rigor, improve data quality, and enable an adaptive study design to increase real-world accessibility. Conclusions: The decentralization of clinical trials through remote models offers tremendous potential to engage representative cohorts, scale biomedical research, and promote accessibility by reducing barriers common in traditional trial design. Our model highlights the critical role that hospital-community partnerships play in remote recruitment, and the work still needed to ensure representative enrollment. Barriers and burdens within remote trials may be experienced disproportionately across demographic groups.

Despite the valuable contribution of the research community to the field of UV-C disinfection by robots, there still lacks a disinfection system that is fully autonomous and computes its trajectory in real-time and in unknown environments. To meet this need, we propose an autonomous UV-C disinfection strategy for indoor environments based on a dynamic Irradiation Map that indicates the amount of energy applied in each region. Our method was tested in different scenarios and compared with other disinfection strategies. Experiments show that our approach delivers better results, especially when targeting high ideal UV-C doses.","output":"Autonomous Environment Disinfection Based on Dynamic UV-C Irradiation Map"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the psychosocial well-being of health and social care professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study deploying in-depth, individual interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used for coding. PARTICIPANTS: This study involved 25 participants from a range of frontline professions in health and social care. SETTING: Interviews were conducted over the phone or video call, depending on participant preference.

The participants expressed difficulties such as communication challenges and changing work conditions, but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work, and a greater reflection on what matters in life. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the support needs of health and social care professionals amid continued and future disruptions caused by the pandemic. It also elucidates some of the successful strategies (such as mindfulness, hobbies, restricting news intake, virtual socialising activities) deployed by health and social care professionals that can support their resilience and well-being and be used to guide future interventions.","output":"Psychosocial impact on frontline health and social care professionals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Inflammatory response plays a critical role in propagating tissue damage after focal cerebral ischemia. CXCL12 is a key chemokine for leukocyte recruitment. However, the role of CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in ischemia-induced inflammatory response is unclear. Here we use the pharmacological antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, to investigate the function of CXCL12/CXCR4 in regulating inflammatory response during acute ischemia. METHODS Adult male CD-1 mice (n=184) underwent permanent suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). AMD3100 was injected for 3 days (1 mg/kg/day) after MCAO. Brain water content, infarct volume, neurological score, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression and activity were examined at 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO. Proinflammatory cytokine RNA and protein levels in brain tissue were measured by RT-PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Neurological score was greatly improved in AMD3100-treated mice compared with the control mice 3 days after MCAO (P<0.05). Brain edema-induced change of water content, IgG protein leakage, Evans blue extravasation, occludin, and ZO-1 expression in ipsilateral hemisphere were alleviated by acute treatment of AMD3100. MPO expression and activity revealed that AMD3100 profoundly reduced the number of MPO-positive cells in the ischemic region (P<0.05). It also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor , and interferon ; their mRNA and protein levels changed accordingly compared with the controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 significantly suppressed inflammatory response and reduced blood-brain barrier disruption after MCAO. AMD3100 attenuated ischemia-induced acute inflammation by suppressing leukocyte migration and infiltration, in addition to reducing proinflammatory cytokine expression in the ischemic region.","output":"CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 protects blood-brain barrier integrity and reduces inflammatory response after focal ischemia in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent and control the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the community health service center should take the initiative to cooperate with sub-district office and police station to form a joint working team Taking the advantages of professional expertise and using service contract system, the general practitioners can publicize the epidemic prevention knowledge and self-protection methods among community residents;and also take door-to-door inspection to make the decision of home isolation, centralized isolation, fever clinic visit or transfer to the designated hospital for observation and treatment During the COVID-19 epidemic, we should give full play to the enthusiasm initiative of the community, general practitioners and residents to implement prevention and control measures and to ensure the health and safety of the people ? 2020 Chinese Medical Association","output":"Roles of community health service centers in prevention and control on epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients is both controversial and challenging, particularly in a healthcare setup unable to fulfill COVID-19 protocols.

However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. METHODS: To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). RESULTS: Whilst specificity of standard RT-LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed RT-LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel RT-LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. CONCLUSION: In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed RT-LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits.","output":"Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in primary material based on a novel multiplex RT-LAMP assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments around the world are tackling the COVID-19 pandemic with a mix of public health, fiscal, macroprudential, monetary, and/or market-based policies.

In this study, we aimed to compare diagnostic performance, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, of POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 infections in patients submitting to the emergency room (ER). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 93 patients with a suspected COVID-19 infection, admitted to the ER between March 28th and April 20th, 2020. Test subjects showed one or more symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, for which consequent COVID-19 testing was achieved using POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR. CT images were analyzed by 2 radiologists blinded to RT-PCR results. POCUS lung was performed by three emergency medical doctors, and reports were analyzed by the researcher, blinded to clinical information, US imaging, CT, and RT-PCR test results. RESULTS: Compared with RT-PCR, POCUS lung demonstrated outstanding sensitivity and NPV (93.3% and 94.1% respectively) while showing poor values for specificity, PPV, and accuracy (21.3%, 19.2%, and 33.3% respectively). In contrast, similar inquiries using chest CT as index test, excellent sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and accuracy (80.0%, 86.7%, 95.6%, and 85.6%, respectively) were reported, beside a moderate value for PPV (54.5%).

This reduction has slowed in the last decade with most deaths now occurring in families experiencing social and economic deprivation. A systematic review of the literature was commissioned by the National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel in England. The review covered three areas: interventions to improve engagement with support services, parental decision-making for the infant sleep environment, and interventions to improve safer sleep practices in families with infants considered to be at risk of SUDI. Aim: To describe the safer sleep interventions tested with families with infants at risk of SUDI and investigate what this literature can tell us about what works to reduce risk and embed safer sleep practices in this group. Methods: Eight online databases were systematically searched in December 2019. Intervention studies that targeted families with infants (0C1 year) at increased risk of SUDI were included. Studies were limited to those from Western Europe, North America or Australasia, published in the last 15 years. The Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs was applied to assess quality. Data from included studies were extracted for narrative synthesis, including mode of delivery using Michie et al.'s Mode of Delivery Taxonomy. Results: The wider review returned 3,367 papers, with 23 intervention papers. Five types of intervention were identified: (1) infant sleep space and safer sleep education programs, (2) intensive or targeted home visiting services, (3) peer educators/ambassadors, (4) health education/raising awareness interventions, (5) targeted health education messages using digital media. Conclusion: Influencing behavior in families with infants at risk of SUDI has traditionally focused on getting messages across, with interventions predominantly using education and awareness raising mechanisms. This review found evidence of interventions moving from information giving to information exchange models using personalized, longer term relationship-building models. This shift may represent an improvement in how safer sleep advice is implemented in families with infants at risk, but more robust evidence of effectiveness is required.

Therefore, the study aims were to assess the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes in the obstetric population at Central Hospital of Maputo (HCM), Mozambique. Methods Prospective cohort study conducted at teaching and referral maternity, HCM, from 20 October 2020 to 22 July 2021. We collected maternal and perinatal outcomes up to six weeks postpartum of eligible women (pregnant and postpartum women - up to the 14th day postpartum) screened for COVID-19 (individual test for symptomatic participants and pool testing for asymptomatic). The primary outcome was maternal death, SARS and UCI admission. We estimated the COVID-19 prevalence and the unadjusted RR (95% CI) for maternal and perinatal outcomes. We used the chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare qualitative variables (two-sided p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance). Results We included 239 participants. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 was 9.2% (22/239) and in the symptomatic group was 32.4 % (11/34). About 48% of the participants with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. Moreover, the most frequent symptoms were dyspnoea (33.3%), cough (28.6%), anosmia (23.8%), and fever (19%). Not having a partner, being pregnant, and consuming alcohol were vulnerability factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 among pregnant and postpartum women was associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal outcome, foetal death (RR = 4.0 [1.19C13.48]) and abortion/stillbirth 12.0 [7.7C18.7]). Conversely, we did not observe a significant difference in the primary outcomes between exposed and non-exposed groups. Conclusion The prevalence of COVID-19 in the obstetric population is higher than in the general population, and most pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic. Being pregnant, not having a partner and alcohol consumption were factors of greatest vulnerability to SARS-COV-2 infection. Data suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 may have a higher risk of adverse gestational outcomes, reinforcing the need for universal testing and monitoring of this population group.

In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of these aspects for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was presented. The analysis of base usage indicated that all of the IBDV genes possess equivalent overall nucleotide distributions. However when the base usage at each codon positions was analysed by using cluster analysis, the VP5 open reading frame (ORF) formed a different cluster isolated from the other genes. The unusual base usage of VP5 ORF may indicate that the gene was originated by the virus overprinting strategy, a strategy in which virus may create novel gene by utilizing the unused reading frames of its existing genes. Meanwhile, the GC content of the IBDV genes and the chicken's coding sequences was comparable; suggesting the virus imitation of the host to increase its translational efficiency. The analysis of dinucleotide frequency indicated that IBDV genome had dinucleotide bias: the frequencies of CpG and TpA were lower and the TpG was higher than the expected. Classical methylation pathway, a process where CpG converted to TpG, may explain the significant correlation between the CpG deficiency and TpG abundance. Principal component analysis of the dinucleotide frequencies (DF-PCA) was used to analyse the overall dinucleotide frequencies of IBDV genome. DF-PCA on the hypervariable region and polyprotein (VPX-VP4-VP3) gene showed that the very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) was segregated from other strains; which meant vvIBDV had a unique dinucleotide pattern.

Spontaneous, but not deliberate, mind wandering experiences (when attention turns to internal mentation), have been found to predict obsessiveC compulsive tendencies [Seli, P., Risko, E.F., Purdon, C. & Smilek, D. (2017). Intrusive thoughts: linking spontaneous mind wandering and OCD symptomatology. Psychological Research, 81, 392C398. 10.1007/s00426-016-0756-3]. Recent cognitive theory suggests a particular role for future-oriented spontaneous thought in obsessiveCcompulsive (OC) symptoms. Thus, we hypothesised that future-oriented rather than past-oriented spontaneous mind wandering would predict OC symptoms, such that more future-oriented mind wandering would be associated with increases in OC symptoms. METHODS: In an online survey design (nonclinical sample of 104 adults), participants completed three measures: Mind wandering: Spontaneous (MW-S) and Deliberate (MW-D) (Carriere, Seli & Smilek, 2013); Involuntary Autobiographical Memory Inventory (Berntsen, Rubin & Salgado, 2015); and Dimensional ObsessiveCCompulsive Scale (DOCS) (Abramowitz et al., 2010). We adopted a linear regression approach to examine our hypotheses. RESULTS: We provided the first replication of the finding that OC symptoms are predicted by the frequency of spontaneous (but not deliberate) mind wandering, with an underlying positive relationship. Additionally, we found that temporality of spontaneous thought had different predictive effects as a function of the dimension of OC symptoms (i.e., responsibility, unacceptable thoughts, need for symmetry/completeness). CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate support for our temporality hypothesis, which highlights how the construct of temporality can add to our understanding of OC symptoms. The present study also adds to recent conceptual debates regarding mind wandering. We suggest new cognitive and methodological approaches to enhance the understanding of obsessiveCcompulsive disorder, opening new avenues for clinical and experimental research.","output":"Predictors of obsessiveCcompulsive symptomology: mind wandering about the past and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Society is increasingly demanding products with a higher degree of customization and shorter manufacturing phases.

However, few studies have systematically characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. households (1). Previously reported transmission rates vary widely, and data on transmission rates from children are limited. To assess household transmission, a case-ascertained study was conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, and Marshfield, Wisconsin, commencing in April 2020. In this study, index patients were defined as the first household members with COVID-19-compatible symptoms who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, and who lived with at least one other household member. After enrollment, index patients and household members were trained remotely by study staff members to complete symptom diaries and obtain self-collected specimens, nasal swabs only or nasal swabs and saliva samples, daily for 14 days. For this analysis, specimens from the first 7 days were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using CDC RT-PCR protocols.? A total of 191 enrolled household contacts of 101 index patients reported having no symptoms on the day of the associated index patient's illness onset, and among these 191 contacts, 102 had SARS-CoV-2 detected in either nasal or saliva specimens during follow-up, for a secondary infection rate of 53% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-60%). Among fourteen households in which the index patient was aged <18 years, the secondary infection rate from index patients aged <12 years was 53% (95% CI = 31%-74%) and from index patients aged 12-17 years was 38% (95% CI = 23%-56%). Approximately 75% of secondary infections were identified within 5 days of the index patient's illness onset, and substantial transmission occurred whether the index patient was an adult or a child. Because household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common and can occur rapidly after the index patient's illness onset, persons should self-isolate immediately at the onset of COVID-like symptoms, at the time of testing as a result of a high risk exposure, or at the time of a positive test result, whichever comes first.

The large proportion of infected individuals were minorities (Hispanic 65.9%, black 14.6%), on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (95.1%, 87.8%, and 87.8%, respectively), and had excellent allograft function (median 1.25 mg/dL). The most common presenting symptoms were fever, dyspnea, or cough. Most patients were hospitalized (63.4%); mortality was 9.8% and occurred only in patients in the intensive care unit. The most common treatment was reduction or removal of antimetabolite (77.8%). Approximately 26.9% presented with AKI. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients results in a higher rate of hospitalization and mortality than in the general population. In an area with a high number of infections, the mortality rate was lower compared with earlier reports from areas experiencing early surge and strain on the medical system. Minorities were disproportionately affected. Future studies are needed to determine optimal approach to treatment and management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Spectrum of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the world lived a horrible nightmare named the Covid-19 pandemic.

We aimed to examine whether there was a change in the demographic data, triage profile, causes, management, and cost of pediatric emergency department (PED) visits of non-COVID patients during the pandemic period. METHODS: : This study was a retrospective, single-center, observational comparative study that was conducted at the PED. Patient records were examined during the pandemic spring and the same period of the previous year. Patient demographics, waiting time, and outcome of the PED visit were analyzed in the entire population of children admitted to the PED during the study period, whereas more precise data such as the reason for PED use, duration of symptoms, urgency levels according to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), final diagnosis, management, and cost of patient care were analyzed in a sample of admitted patients. We used the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and MannCWhitney U test for statistical analyses. RESULTS: : A total of 62,593 PED visits occurred. During the pandemic period, PED visits showed a decrease of 55.8% compared to the previous year. Patients included in the sampling study group were selected using a systematic random sampling method. The median waiting time during the pandemic period was significantly shorter than the previous year (median 14 min [IQR: 5C32] vs. median 5 min [IQR: 2C16]; p<0.001). The median duration of symptoms was 1 day (1C2) in both groups. Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels I, II, and III showed a significant increase (27.7% vs. 37.3%) in triage scoring compared to levels IV and V (72.3% vs. 62.7%) during the pandemic period (p<0.001). The median cost per patient during the pandemic period was statistically higher compared to the previous year ($19.57 [19.57C40.50] vs. $25.34 [31.50C52.01]; p<0.001). Overall costs during the pandemic period had a 1.6-fold decline. CONCLUSION: : We highlighted the changes in an ordinary PED profile during an extraordinary period. A shift in ESI levels in a more emergent direction was observed. While the number of nonurgent patients, especially those with infections, decreased, the rates of surgical cases, acute neurological and heart diseases, home accidents, and poisoning increased relative to the pre-pandemic period.","output":"Evaluation of changes in pediatric emergency department utilization during COVID-19 pandemic: Changes during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gigantic growth of social media and unbeatable trend of progress in the direction of the web seeking users interests have generated a storm of social text streams. Seeking information to know the phenomenon of various events in the early stages is quite interesting. Various kinds of social media live streams attract users to participate in real-time events to become a part of an immense crowd. However, the vast amount of text is present on social media, the unnecessary information bogs a social text stream filtering to extract the appropriate topics and events effectively. Therefore, detecting, classifying, and identifying burst events is quite challenging due to the sparse and noisy text of Twitter. The researchers' significant open challenges are the effective cleaning and profound representation of the text stream data. This research article's main contribution is to provide a detailed study and explore bursty event detection in the social text stream.

The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas? (Roche) and the RealStar? assay (Altona). METHODS: Assessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas? assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMrieux). RESULTS: Overall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76 %. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99 %. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas? minus RealStar?) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison, both RealStar? and Cobas? assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar? assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","output":"Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention focus is a self-regulatory orientation that serves the need for security, and promotion focus is a self-regulatory orientation serves the need for growth.

For this study, we developed a new measure of the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus. Results supported this hypothesis. Additionally, results showed that the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus related positively to support of the psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness, respectively, in responding to COVID-19.

Subjective feelings related to social relationships such as detachment have shown a strong effect on mental health, whereas objective factors might have a moderating role in that association. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether social support and living situation have a moderating effect on the association between detachment and affective disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: 3,305 Spanish adults were interviewed by phone at the end of the COVID-19 lockdown (May-June 2020). Detachment during confinement was assessed with a single-item frequency question. Anxiety symptoms were measured through GAD-7, depressive symptoms through PHQ-9, and social support through the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS). Associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms were tested through Tobit regression models. Interactions of detachment with living situation and social support were tested as independent variables. RESULTS: People living alone showed significantly lower levels of anxiety whereas people living with another (but not as a couple) showed higher levels of depression. Detachment was strongly associated with both affective disorders. Social support had a statistically significant moderating effect on that association. Those with a low level of social support and a high level of detachment reported means of depression and anxiety above major depression (10.5 CI 95% 9.6, 11.4 at OSSS=10) and generalized anxiety disorders (10.1 CI 95% 9.2, 11.0 at OSSS=9) cut offs CONCLUSION: Interventions centered on improving social support could alleviate feelings of detachment and prevent affective disorders during lockdowns.","output":"The association of detachment with affective disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown: The role of living situation and social support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global changes in response to human encroachment into natural habitats and carbon emissions are driving the biodiversity extinction crisis and increasing disease emergence risk.

In patients at least 40 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the VERTIS-CV trial demonstrated ertugliflozin was non-inferior to placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events, though not superior. Ertugliflozin significantly reduced hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo. The composite renal outcome was not significantly different between groups. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile commensurate with other sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: In patients with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD, ertugliflozin appears safe with a noted non-significant trend toward improved renal outcomes. Approximately 23.7% of patients in the VERTIS-CV trial had heart failure, the highest among SGLT-2 inhibitor CVOTs. The VERTIS-CV trial reaffirms the reduction in heart failure hospitalizations as a likely class effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors. While the trial supports the use of ertugliflozin beyond glycemic control, agents with confirmed superiority for improved cardiovascular outcomes and mortality may be preferred.","output":"Evaluation of cardiovascular and renal outcomes with ertugliflozin: what is the VERdict from the VERTIS-CV trial?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease of pandemic proportions.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECMO is beneficial in severe cases of respiratory failure when mechanical ventilation is inadequate. Outcomes for ECMO-eligible COVID-19 patients on MVA have not been reported. Consequently, a direct comparison between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and those on MVA has not been established. METHODS: A total of 3406 COVID-19 patients treated at two major medical centers in Chicago were studied. One hundred ninety-five required maximum ventilatory support, and met ECMO eligibility criteria. Eighty ECMO patients were propensity matched to an equal number of MVA patients using detailed demographic, physiological, and comorbidity data. Primary outcome was survival and disposition at discharge. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of patients were decannulated from ECMO. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued in 75% ECMO and 16% MVA patients. Twenty-five percent of patients in the ECMO arm expired, 21% while on ECMO, compared with 74% in the MVA cohort. Mortality was significantly lower across all age and BMI groups in the ECMO arm. Sixty-eight percent ECMO and 26% MVA patients were discharged from the hospital. Fewer ECMO patients required long-term rehabilitation. Major complications such as septic shock, ventilator associated pneumonia, inotropic requirements, acute liver and kidney injuries are less frequent among ECMO patients. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO-eligible patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure demonstrate a 3-fold improvement in survival with ECMO. They are also in a better physical state at discharge and have lower overall complication rates. As such, strong consideration should be given for ECMO when mechanical ventilatory support alone becomes insufficient in treating COVID-19 respiratory failure.","output":"Comparative Propensity Matched Outcomes in Severe COVID-19 Respiratory FailureExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation or Maximum Ventilation Alone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth has the potential to offset the high demand for help during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many such households, the home is not the place of sanctuary that it needs to be at a time like this. However, our empirical research into the lived experiences of fuel poverty reveals additional consequences for fuel poor households, chiefly associated with restricted access to third spaces and other disruptions to their usual coping strategies. Based on our evidence, we highlight three key considerations for policy on fuel poverty in the era of Covid-19: the need to rapidly upgrade the energy performance of the existing housing stock; the need to address the additional financial hardship faced by fuel poor households; and the need to prioritise access to third spaces and high-quality public spaces while restrictions last.

A day after the procedure, during a migraine crisis, at the continuous electrocardiographic monitoring it was registered a brief episode of complete atrioventricular block, which regressed spontaneously after a few minutes. For this reason, she underwent atropine test which resulted negative for AV conductance defects. No more episodes were recorded during the hospital stay, however it was decided to implant a loop recorder (Biotronik BIOMONITOR III) before the discharge. The patient received a remote monitoring device in order to allow a closer follow-up in course of the COVID-19-related lockdown, that caused a relevant reduction in the outpatients services. A few months later a sinusal pause of about 9 s was recorded with the emergence of an idioventricular rhythm at 25 b.p.m. When contacted by telephone the patient reported being hospitalized because of pulmonary complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. She referred of being bedridden, without any cardiac monitor and of being asymptomatic for syncope. Thus, she was transferred to a Cardiology Unit dedicated to patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 disease, for further diagnostic investigations. This represents a case in which the remote monitoring technology resulted fundamental in the management of patients with implantable devices, in particular during COVID-19-related lockdown. However, it is at least as much important to encourage the patient to carry the transmitter with him, even in the case of unexpected events or hospitalizations, in order to gain access to all the information store in the CIED which might be useful to the diagnosis of the underlying disease. Biotronik has developed the smallest remote transmitter in commerce (CardioMessenger Smart) which is functional to this kind of use. Moreover, it has an automatic interrogation function which can send the alerts about the arrhythmic events quicker than the other brands and so its more practical in situations where the patient is hospitalized in non-cardiological units.","output":"124 Tiny but useful transportable remote monitoring device during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020 This anthropogenic emissions switch-off presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020 For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2 5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2 5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41C53 % (Delhi), 26C54 % (Hyderabad), 24C36 % (Kolkata), and 10C39 % (Mumbai) Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions Aerosol loading decreased by 29 % (Chennai), 11 % (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0 69 billion USD Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans","output":"Temporary reduction in fine particulate matter due to anthropogenic emissions switch-off during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for data to inform coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response efforts. At the same time, the pandemic has created challenges for data collection, one of which is interviewer training in the context of social distancing. In sub-Saharan Africa, in-person interviewer training and face-to-face data collection remain the norm, requiring researchers to think creatively about transitioning to remote settings to allow for safer data collection that respects government guidelines. Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA, formerly PMA2020) has collected both cross-sectional and longitudinal data on key reproductive health measures in Africa and Asia since 2013. Relying on partnerships with in-country research institutes and cadres of female interviewers recruited from sampled communities, the project was well-positioned to transition to collecting data on COVID-19 from the onset of the pandemic. This article presents PMA's development of a remote training system for COVID-19 surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, including challenges faced and lessons learned. We demonstrate that remote interviewer training can be a viable approach when data are critically needed and in-person learning is not possible. We also argue against systematic replacement of in-person trainings with remote learning, instead recommending consideration of local context and a project's individual circumstances when contemplating a transition to remote interviewer training.","output":"Remote Interviewer Training for COVID-19 Data Collection: Challenges and Lessons Learned From 3 Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenes such as betulin and betulinic acid play an important role in the search for new therapies that would be effective in controlling viral infections.

In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 M. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed.

This caused reduced exposure to sunlight but increased exposure to screens. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic inflammatory ocular condition in which exposure to light plays a cardinal role. We conducted an online survey to evaluate the impact of screen exposure in children with VKC during the lockdown. Methods We performed a survey-based observational study, asking patients followed at the Allergology of Meyer Childrens University Hospital in Florence and of Policlinico Umberto I in Rome to provide grading on 6 subjective ocular clinical manifestations presented during the lockdown and to give an estimate of the hours/day of screen exposure. Results Mean scores of signs and symptoms increased homogeneously when studying patients exposed to longer screen time. When comparing scores collected in 2019 versus 2020, there was not a significant reduction in clinical manifestations, although the situation differed between the two centres due to geographical differences in sunlight exposure. Conclusion During the lockdown, there was a reduction of sunlight exposure but conversely an increase in the time spent in front of screens that correlated with the worsening of VKC signs symptoms in direct proportion to the hours/day of screen exposure.

In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment. METHODS: Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99  3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the being away dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the being away and fascination dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables. RESULTS: Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.","output":"Does greenery experienced indoors and outdoors provide an escape and support mental health during the COVID-19 quarantine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities are central in the national conversation about Covid-19. Black/African Americans are contracting and dying from COVID-19 disproportionately. We assessed risk factors for death from COVID-19 among black inpatients at an urban center in Detroit, MI. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study. We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay, who were admitted between 3/8-5/6/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The case fatality rate was 29.1% (122/419). The mean duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 5.3 (3.9) days. Patients who died were older (mean [SD] age, 68.7 [14.8] years vs 60.3 [16.0] years; p <0.0001), had dementia (35 [28.7%] vs 34 [11.4%]; p <0.0001), hemiplegia (14 [11.5%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.004), malignancy (11 [9.0%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.04), and moderate-severe liver disease (4 [3.3%] vs 1 [0.3%]; p=0.01).

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus unexpectedly identified at hemorrhoidectomy pathologic evaluation is not uncommon. We hypothesized this is occurring more frequently and sought to evaluate its impact on outcomes. METHODS: The Kentucky Cancer Registry, a premier population database, was queried for all squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases between 2007 and 2016. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus patients were compared with nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. Patient demographics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 722 squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases identified, 3.05% (n = 22) were within hemorrhoidectomy specimens. Demographics were similar between hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus versus nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Chemoradiation was the most common treatment strategy among all patients, and there were similar rates of disease, persistence, recurrence, and survival between hemorrhoidal and nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma. Stage I disease was more common in the hemorrhoid group compared with the nonhemorrhoid group (63% vs 27%, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus comprised 3.05% of our population-based cohort. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus were more likely to receive chemoradiation compared with local excision, but there were similar oncologic outcomes. We postulate that some individuals may receive overtreatment with chemoradiation owing to imprecise labeling of hemorrhoid specimens.

Questions/Purposes: To help strategize an effective return to elective orthopedic surgery, we aimed to quantify the volume of THA and TKA cases delayed across the USA and estimate the time required to care for these patients when non-urgent surgery resumes. Methods: Population-level data was used to estimate monthly THA and TKA procedural volume from 2011 to 2017. Using linear regression, we used this data to project monthly procedural volumes for 2020 to 2023. Nine different permutations were modeled to account for variations in case delay rates (50%, 75%, 100%) and in resumption of non-urgent procedure timing. Two recovery pathways using the highest volume month as a surrogate for maximum operative capacity, and a second using the highest month + 20% were used to simulate a theoretical expansion of current capacity. Results: The projected national volume of delayed cases was 155,293 (mid-March through April; 95% CI 142,004 to 168,580), 260,806 (through May; 95% CI 238,658 to 282,952), and 372,706 (through June; 95% CI 341,699 to 403,709).

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and its accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a master regulator of vascular homeostasis, represents a therapeutic target for COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1 and TNF-, two cytokines elevated in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Pharmacologic (atorvastatin and tannic acid) and genetic (adenoviral overexpression) approaches to augment KLF2 levels attenuated COVID-19-serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis, and reduced angiogenesis). Finally, knockdown of KLF2 partially reversed the ameliorative effect of atorvastatin on COVID-19-serum-induced endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present study aimed to examine perceived coercion in those who have experienced COVID-19-related lockdown and/or worked as a frontline healthcare worker across three European countries. It aimed to describe how such perceptions may impact on psychological well-being, coping and post-traumatic growth. It will employ an explanatory mixed-methods research methodology consisting of an online survey and online asynchronous virtual focus groups (AVFGs) and individual interviews. &#967;2 tests and analyses of variance will be used to examine whether participants from different countries differ according to demographic factors, whether there are differences between cohorts on perceived coercion, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic growth scores.

Even though we are only dealing with a single data type, the epistasis detection problem suffers from many pitfalls, such as the wide variety of analytic tools to detect them, each highlighting different aspects of epistasis and exhibiting different properties in maintaining false positive control. To reconcile different network views to the same problem, we considered 3 network aggregation methods and discussed their performance in the context of epistasis network aggregation. We furthermore applied a latent class method as best performer to real-life data on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and highlighted its benefits to increase our understanding about IBD underlying genetic architectures.","output":"Network Aggregation to Enhance Results Derived from Multiple Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of 5 confirmed COVIDa??19 cases related with the transmission in incubation period of initial case, and find out the infection source and transmission chain.. Methods: According to \\"The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)\\" issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR. Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. Results: Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVIDa??19 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January. Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January. Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January. Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled. After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January. Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period. It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. Conclusion: The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control.","output":"[Investigation of an epidemic cluster caused by COVIDa??19 cases in incubation period in Shanghai]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a heterogeneous condition requiring complex treatment from diverse healthcare services. An increasingly holistic understanding of healthcare has resulted in contextual factors such as perceived quality of care, as well as patients' acceptance, preferences and subjective expectations of health services, all gaining in importance. How patients with CHF experience the use of healthcare services has not been studied within the scope of a systematic review in a German healthcare context. The aim of this scoping review is therefore to review systematically the experiences of patients affected by CHF with healthcare services in Germany in the literature and to map the research foci. Further objectives are to identify gaps in evidence, develop further research questions and to inform decision makers concerned with improving healthcare of patients living with CHF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will be based on a broad search strategy involving systematic and comprehensive electronic database searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL and Cochrane's Database of Systematic Reviews, grey literature searches, as well as hand searches through reference lists and non-indexed key journals. The methodological procedure will be based on an established six-stage framework for conducting scoping reviews that includes two independent reviewers. Data will be systematically extracted, qualitatively and quantitatively analysed and summarised both narratively and visually. To ensure the research questions and extracted information are meaningful, a patient representative will be involved. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval will not be required to conduct this review. Results will be disseminated through a clearly illustrated report that will be part of a wider research project. Furthermore, it is intended that the review's findings should be made available to relevant stakeholders through conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals (knowledge transfer).

RESULTS: The cohort included 142 A+C cases, 1110 C+ controls, and 140 A+ controls. A+C cases were more likely than C+ controls to present with dyspnea and wheezing, to receive pharmacologic treatment including systemic steroids (all p < .01), and to be hospitalized (4.9% vs. 1.7%, p = .01). In the adjusted analysis, A+C cases were nearly 4 times more likely to be hospitalized than C+ controls (adjusted OR = 3.95 [95%CI = 1.4C10.9]); however, length of stay and respiratory support level did not differ between groups. Among A+C cases, 8.5% presented with an asthma exacerbation and another 6.3% developed acute exacerbation symptoms shortly after testing positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

Along with its mosquito vector, the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has spread explosively in the last 20 years, and there is no approved treatment for chikungunya fever. On the plasma membrane of the infected cell, CHIKV generates dedicated organelles for viral RNA replication, so-called spherules. Whereas structures exist for several viral proteins that make up the spherule, the architecture of the full organelle is unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to image CHIKV spherules in their cellular context. This reveals that the viral protein nsP1 serves as a base for the assembly of a larger protein complex at the neck of the membrane bud. Biochemical assays show that the viral helicase-protease nsP2, while having no membrane affinity on its own, is recruited to membranes by nsP1. The tomograms further reveal that full-sized spherules contain a single copy of the viral genome in double-stranded form. Finally, we present a mathematical model that explains the membrane remodeling of the spherule in terms of the pressure exerted on the membrane by the polymerizing RNA, which provides a good agreement with the experimental data. The energy released by RNA polymerization is found to be sufficient to remodel the membrane to the characteristic spherule shape.","output":"Architecture of the chikungunya virus replication organelle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged &#8805; 18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-stratification by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. RESULTS: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%-58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%-92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%.

Upon binding of its ligand cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) produced by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) or invading bacteria, STING is activated, leading to the induction of both type I interferon responses and autophagy, which are critical for the control of certain microbial infections. RNA viruses, such as Parainfluenza virus (PIV) and Rhinovirus (HRV), are among the leading causes of respiratory infections that affect human health without effective treatments. Activation of STING pathway may provide a new therapeutic approach fighting against these viruses. However, the role of STING in the control of RNA virus infection remains largely unexplored. In this study, using dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI), a newly discovered synthetic small molecule STING receptor agonist with much higher potency than CDNs, we found that activation of STING elicits potent antiviral effects against parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) and human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16), two representative respiratory viral pathogens. Notably, while anti-PIV3 activity was depend on the induction of type I interferon responses through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), anti-HRV16 activity required the induction of autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5)-dependent autophagy, indicating that two distinct antiviral mechanisms are engaged upon STING activation. Antiviral activity and individual specific pathway was further confirmed in infected primary bronchial epithelial cells.

Traditional methods of in-person recruiting and using paper marketing material were eliminated almost overnight at the onset of the pandemic. Researchers quickly adapted their recruitment strategies, but researchers had to shift local, in-person recruitment efforts to solely using online platforms. The shifting recruitment strategies were accompanied with unexpected challenges, but we were able to meet our accrual goal for focus groups. OBJECTIVES The objective of this brief report is to explore new recruitment strategies that developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer suggestions for future online-based qualitative studies. RESULTS Prior to COVID-19, we designed four main strategies (research registry, marketing material, social media, and provider endorsement) to recruit potential participants for focus groups as part of a qualitative, descriptive study involving young women breast cancer survivors. After the onset of COVID-19, we successfully adapted each of our initial four strategies to recruit potential participants in an incremental process. Using these adapted strategies, a total of 62 young women completed the first part of the data collection process prior to participating in a focus group. Thirty-three women participated in the focus groups, and the remaining 29 participants were lost to follow-up. The vast majority of participants were recruited through marketing material and social media after making strategic changes to recruitment. DISCUSSION The most effective method of recruitment was the strategic use of marketing material and social media, and we offer suggestions for researchers considering online recruitment methods. We recommend that researchers use various social media platforms and specific hashtags and target their sample population at the onset of the study. The data collection changes initiated by the effects of COVID-19 may remain, and researchers can consider implementing permanent recruitment strategies to best meet the needs of this new landscape of conducing online focus groups.","output":"Revising Recruitment for Focus Groups to Meet Shifting Needs During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asynchronous programming models (APM) are gaining more and more traction, allowing applications to expose the available concurrency to a runtime system tasked with coordinating the execution. While MPI has long provided support for multi-threaded communication and non-blocking operations, it falls short of adequately supporting APMs as correctly and efficiently handling MPI communication in different models is still a challenge. Meanwhile, new low-level implementations of light-weight, cooperatively scheduled execution contexts (fibers, aka user-level threads (ULT)) are meant to serve as a basis for higher-level APMs and their integration in MPI implementations has been proposed as a replacement for traditional POSIX thread support to alleviate these challenges. In this paper, we first establish a taxonomy in an attempt to clearly distinguish different concepts in the parallel software stack. We argue that the proposed tight integration of fiber implementations with MPI is neither warranted nor beneficial and instead is detrimental to the goal of MPI being a portable communication abstraction. We propose MPI Continuations as an extension to the MPI standard to provide callback-based notifications on completed operations, leading to a clear separation of concerns by providing a loose coupling mechanism between MPI and APMs. We show that this interface is flexible and interacts well with different APMs, namely OpenMP detached tasks, OmpSs-2, and Argobots.","output":"Fibers are not (P)Threads: The Case for Loose Coupling of Asynchronous Programming Models and MPI Through Continuations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PPE is an integral part of reducing transmission of COVID-19.

However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms \\"Prevention coronavirus,\\" \\"Prevention COVID-19,\\" \\"Prevencin coronavirus,\\" and \\"Prevencin COVID-19\\". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was \\"wash your hands frequently\\" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to \\"stay home if you feel unwell\\" (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as \\"wash your hands frequently\\" (OR 9.82), \\"cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze\\" (OR 4.59), or \\"stay home if you feel unwell\\" (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.","output":"Assessment of Health Information About COVID-19 Prevention on the Internet: Infodemiological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the majority of pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have not been critical, occurrences of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been emerging as the pandemic progresses Herein, we report our experience with a pediatric COVID-19 case that presented with shock and multisystem inflammation Our patient notably had multiple negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody This case not only highlights the utility of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the diagnosis of COVID-19 when RT-PCR is negative but suggests MIS-C may be a post-infectious immune-mediated process","output":"Pediatric Case of Severe COVID-19 With Shock and Multisystem Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a significant and global public health crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought into light ACE2, its principal product angiotensin (Ang) 1-7, and the G protein-coupled receptor for the heptapeptide (MasR), which together form a still under-recognized arm of the reninCangiotensin system (RAS). This axis counteracts vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis, generated by the more familiar deleterious arm of RAS, including ACE, Ang II and the ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The COVID-19 disease is characterized by the depletion of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), conceivably playing a central role in the devastating cytokine storm that characterizes this disorder. ACE2 repletion and the administration of Ang-(1-7) constitute the therapeutic options currently tested in the management of severe COVID-19 disease cases. Based on their beneficial effects, both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) have also been suggested to slow the progression of experimental diabetic and hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Herein, we report a further step undertaken recently, utilizing this type of intervention in the management of evolving acute kidney injury (AKI), with the expectation of renal vasodilation and the attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation, renal parenchymal damage and subsequent fibrosis. Most outcomes indicate that triggering the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis may be renoprotective in the setup of AKI.

In vivo, equal amounts of cisplatin (10mg/kg) were introduced into rabbit pleural cavities either by free form (Gr1) or pellets form (Gr2). Cisplatin concentrations in the collected pleural effusion and blood were measured and compared by repeated measurement ANOVA. In vitro, approximately 5% of the cisplatin was released in the first day while the rest was gradually released in the following 50 days. In vivo, the cisplatin level in the pleural fluid was equally high during the first 2 days but dropped quickly in Gr1 while remaining high in Gr2 for 18 days, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001) In contrast, the plasma cisplatin level was 10 times significantly higher in Gr1 than in Gr2 (P<0.001), which resulted in two early deaths of rabbits.

Currently there is little published data about the experiences of specialist palliative care teams who are using technology to communicate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this evaluation was to describe the experience of a UK based hospital specialist palliative care team, who were using video communication technology to support care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey was distributed to the specialist palliative care team at a University teaching hospital in the North West of the UK. We asked participants to provide their views on the scope of use, barriers and future opportunities to use technology for communication in hospital palliative care. Results: The survey was completed by 14 healthcare professionals. Participants indicated that the most common reasons for using the technology was to receive team updates (n= 14, 100%), participate in multidisciplinary team meetings (n=14, 100%), for education (n=12, 86%) and to facilitate cross-site working (n=9, 64%). We identified barriers to using the technology, which were summarised as: (1) user-based difficulties;(2) inadequate technological infrastructure;(3) data security, privacy and ethical concerns;and (4) concerns regarding staff wellbeing. Participants stated that technology can potentially improve care by improving communication with hospital and community teams and increasing access to education. We have used these findings to develop recommendations to help palliative care teams to implement this technology better in clinical practice.

This study investigated whether a pneumoperitoneum during abdominal surgery influences the spread of local anesthetics. METHODS Nine fresh frozen cadavers were used for the study. Using an ultrasound-guided midaxillary technique, a unilateral TAP block-like injection with 20 mL of methylene blue dye was performed. After the injection, a pneumoperitoneum was immediately installed for 1 hour. After desufflation, this ipsilateral side was dissected, and a TAP block-like injection was performed on the contralateral side. One hour after injection, the contralateral side was also dissected. The anatomical dissection was used to determine the extent of dye spread and the nerves stained by the dye. RESULTS In none of the specimens did the dye reach the posterior origin of the transverse abdominal muscle. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of stained nerves and spread of the dye in the insufflated side compared with the noninsufflated side. In 4 of 9 cadavers, we found a variant course of a nerve preventing staining of that nerve. CONCLUSIONS The stretch of the abdominal wall caused by the insufflation of the abdomen does not influence the spread of dye in the abdominal wall. Because of the absence of posterior spread, regardless of the timing of a midaxillary ultrasound-guided approach, we believe that a posterior approach should be chosen if posterior spread is desired.","output":"Pneumoperitoneum Does Not Influence Spread of Local Anesthetics in Midaxillary Approach Transversus Abdominis Plane Block: A Descriptive Cadaver Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International education has always been about building connections and free exploration It is about learning from others and learning about ourselves And, in the COVID-19 pandemic, the sudden disconnecting of global engagements has made the absence of our growth through international education and internationalization efforts particularly visible First, society needs knowmadic workers who work with context, not rigid structure One key reality is that the jobs schools typically prepare us for - work as factory workers, bureaucrats, or soldiers - are disappearing They are being replaced with knowledge- and innovation-based work which requires people to function contextually, working almost anytime, anywhere, and with nearly anybody These emerging workers are knowmads, and they apply their individual knowledge across different \\"gigs\\" or contingent engagements to create new value As unique individuals, knowmads possess personal knowledge with developed explicit (i e , \\"book knowledge\\") and tacit (i e , soft skills) elements They are comfortable with change and ambiguity, applying their personal knowledge contextually to solve new problems Knowmads can flow through cultures, organizationally and socially","output":"International education in the era of COVID-19: Making learning visible"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has created massive economic policy uncertainty (EPU). EPU and its economic fallout have been a hot topic of study; however, the impact of EPU on CO(2) emissions has been seldom addressed to date. This paper investigates the effects of the EPU on CO(2) emissions. It elucidates the role of EPU in moderating the environmental regulation-CO(2) emissions nexus at the national and regional levels using the panel data model and provincial panel data from 2003 to 2017 in China. The main empirical results are as follows. The EPU has a negative impact on carbon emissions; however, this relationship is non-significant even at the 10% level in the central and western region datasets. Environmental regulation positively increases the CO(2) emissions implying that the green paradox occurs in the whole and western regions datasets. From the perspective of the moderating effect of uncertainty, EPU exerts a positive impact upon the environmental regulation-CO(2) emissions nexus in the whole and western region datasets. The moderating effect is not significant in the eastern and central regions. The results demonstrate that the re-examination of the EKC hypothesis is inconclusive. Kuznets relationship between economic growth and CO(2) emissions for the national, eastern, and central samples was confirmed. In contrast, CO(2) emissions monotonically rise as GDP grows for western datasets. Based on the overall findings, some policy implications were put forward. We recommend that the local government should consider EPU to improve the institutional environment. Further, different regions should implement various environmental policies according to regional conditions maximizing the emission reduction potential.","output":"How does economic policy uncertainty affect CO(2) emissions?

Our review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mental health interventions among adolescents in India. We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases and used cross-referencing to review the interventions published from 2010 to 2020. Eleven interventions were included in this review; nine were school-based, one community, and one digital. Most of the school-based programs used a life skills curriculum. Additionally, coping skills and resilience curricula showed improvement in depressive symptoms, cognitive abilities, academic stress, problem-solving, and overall mental well-being. The multi-component whole-school intervention was quite promising and helped in improving the overall school climate and various other mental health outcomes. Hence, school-based programs should be implemented as an entry point for screening mental health problems.

The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation & conclusions: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, thus it is important to recognize and diagnose the disease entity and treat early. When neuropsychiatric symptoms are involved, typically there are many other systemic features to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. Many autoantibodies have been discovered and are used to help diagnose SLE. The antibody present in most cases of pediatric SLE, as well as in many other rheumatic diseases, is the nonspecific antinuclear antibody (ANA). The ANA is a commonly used screening tool by primary care physicians when evaluating a patient with a possible rheumatic disorder. However, a small subset of SLE patients, 1-5%, present with a negative ANA, and it is important to keep SLE on the differential diagnosis in specific instances when a thorough infectious, metabolic and neurological workup has been completed and proven to be inconclusive. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a Hispanic adolescent female with a negative ANA who presented with diffuse cerebral edema secondary to leukoencephalopathy due to SLE with central nervous system involvement. She was normotensive on presentation and relatively symptom free aside from headache. She had an extensive workup while inpatient involving metabolic, infectious disease, rheumatology, and neurology prior to obtaining the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab with appropriate disease response. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature revealed 12 cases with SLE presenting with or developing diffuse cerebral edema and/or leukoencephalopathy. Our patient's case differs in that she was also ANA negative despite other autoantibody positivity. While she did have low complements and transient leukopenia, she did not present with other signs of organ involvement, which made the diagnosis of SLE with neuropsychiatric involvement quite challenging. We discuss the importance of keeping SLE on the differential diagnosis despite a negative ANA in complex cases after thorough workup has been unrevealing, and to consider initial screening with not only the ANA but also dsDNA and complements to avoid missed diagnoses.","output":"Leukoencephalopathy and cerebral edema as the presenting manifestations of SLE in an ANA-negative adolescent female: a case report and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented effort to generate real-world evidence on the safety and effectiveness of various treatments.

Silicon nitride, an industrial ceramic that is also used as an implant in spine surgery, has known antibacterial activity. The mechanism of antibacterial action relates to the hydrolytic release of surface disinfectants. It is hypothesized that silicon nitride can also inactivate the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Methods SARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to 15 wt.% aqueous suspensions of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, and copper particles. The virus was titrated by the TCD50 method using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, while viral RNA was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunostaining and Raman spectroscopy were used as additional probes to investigate the cellular responses to virions exposed to the respective materials. Results All three tested materials showed >99% viral inactivation at one and ten minutes of exposure. Degradation of viral RNA was also observed with all materials. Immunofluorescence testing showed that silicon nitride-treated virus failed to infect VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells without damaging them. In contrast, the copper-treated virus suspension severely damaged the cells due to copper ion toxicity. Raman spectroscopy indicated differential biochemical cellular changes due to infection and metal toxicity for two of the three materials tested. Conclusions Silicon nitride successfully inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The mechanism of action was the hydrolysis-mediated surface release of nitrogen-containing disinfectants. Both aluminum nitride and copper were also effective in the inactivation of the virus. However, while the former compound affected the cells, the latter compound had a cytopathic effect.

Medications from pain physicians were delivered at home through a hospital pharmacy. A secure national electronic health records system used by all teams ensured seamless access and documentation. Potential emergency department visits, admissions and delayed discharges were thus avoided. Integration of community teams with chronic pain management services can be recommended to ensure pandemic preparedness.","output":"Collaboration between a tertiary pain centre and community teams during the pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic challenged society, requiring measures that impacted communities socially and economically. Rurally dispersed older adults [RDOA] have a greater number of health comorbidities, poorer finances and limited access to internet and community resources (e.g. healthcare specialists), leaving them more vulnerable in a crisis. Current guidelines are better suited to urban communities, neglect certain needs of RDOA, and are at times difficult to navigate/access due to their online formats. RDOA specific resources are warranted and development should involve stakeholders. CMU-CARES sought to develop an innovative protocol that would engage RDOA in the development of a crisis preparedness toolkit. CMU-CARES protocol consists of six stages. (1) Awareness by community-based outreach (e.g. mailed-letters, social media, community organizations) and participation from older adults in previous studies with the college of medicine. (2) Engagement occurred once a participant expressed interest. (3) Screening was completed at time of engagement. (4) Interviews/Interactions were modified from the WHOQOL-BREF and completed via Web-Ex online software to observe social distancing requirements. (5) Transcript analysis was completed with NVivo software to identify participant identified themes. (6) Design and development of a toolkit based on interviews. A target sample limited to 20C25 RDOA was used to reach data saturation. Presently 20 interviews have been completed. Preliminary themes include the need for timely and reliable information, training in use of technology and the need for social interaction. Overall, CMU-CARES is a novel person-centered project dedicated to improving well-being and healthcare outcomes in the vulnerable RDOA population during crises. It hopes to foster camaraderie between healthcare providers and the community while inspiring medical student driven research and fostering careers in geriatrics, primary care and public health policy.","output":"An innovative patient driven protocol for the development of a crisis preparedness toolkit: CMU-CARES [Crisis Avoidance for Rural Elderly Stakeholders]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The OxfordCAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Vaxzevira or Covishield) builds on two decades of research and development (R&D) into chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx) technology at the University of Oxford. This study aimed to approximate the funding for the R&D of ChAdOx and the OxfordCAstraZeneca vaccine and to assess the transparency of funding reporting mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review and publication history analysis of the principal investigators to reconstruct R&D funding the ChAdOx technology. We matched award numbers with publicly accessible grant databases. We filed freedom of information (FOI) requests to the University of Oxford for the disclosure of all grants for ChAdOx R&D.

Complication rates associated with surgical resection of lower extremity tumors and replacement with megaendoprostheses are high. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predispose to revision surgery following the use of megaimplants in curative treatment of malignant tumors of the lower extremities. METHODS: this retrospective study included patients aged &#8805; 18 years who underwent implantation of a megaendoprosthesis for tumors or metastatic lesions of the lower extremities between January 2010 and December 2020. Baseline characteristics and information on adjuvant treatment, hospitalization time, comorbidities, mobility, complications, and revision surgery were considered. Primary outcomes were revision surgery and reasons for revision. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and the duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (48% female, age 63 years, SD 15) were available for final analysis. Surgeries were performed at hip level in 37 patients (68.5%) and at knee level in 17 patients (31.5%). Revision for wound-related causes was performed in 12 cases (22.2%), with microbiological proof of infection in 8 cases (14.8%). Revision for hip joint instability was carried out in 4 cases (7.4%) and for disconnection between components of the megaimplant in 2 cases (3.7%). Those patients requiring a wound-related revision had undergone a longer primary surgical intervention than those who required an implant-related revision (276 vs 134 min, p = .002). Wound drains after the primary implantation remained longer in situ in patients who later required revision surgery for wound-related complications (5 vs 3 days, p = .020). An ASA > 3 was associated with an increased likelihood for in-hospital complications in general (p = .041), and in-hospital death in particular (p = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities with megaendoprostheses is associated with a high rate of wound-related complications. Swift surgical performance and early postoperative removal of wound drains minimize the risk of complications in general and the necessity of revision surgery in particular. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to suffer in-hospital complications.","output":"Megaendoprostheses in the management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities-risk factors for revision surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, in the United States, we have a health care system that is designed to treat symptoms, not people-and to do so as cheaply as possible with the dual goals of minimizing costs and preventing hospital visits.

It has been suggested that PIU might represent a maladaptive coping strategy to tackle problematic psychosocial functioning. In this line, the current cross-sectional study focused on PIUs role in the association between personality dimensions and internalizing/externalizing problems. Two-hundred thirty-one middle and late adolescents (age range 15C19 years; 62% Female) attending public junior high schools in Italy completed the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Adolescent Personality Structure Questionnaire (APS-Q), and the Youth Self Report (YSR). Moderation analyses were used to test the hypothesis that higher PIU amplifies the relationship between maladaptive personality dimensions and psychological symptoms. Results indicated that only high PIU influenced the relationship between difficulties in building significant relationships with peers and internalizing problems. Conversely, PIU buffered the relationship between difficulties in adolescents sense of self (identity) and internalizing problems and the association between aggression regulation and internalizing problems, supporting the role of PIU as a maladaptive coping strategy. These findings encourage accurately evaluating PIU as a risk factor in adolescence: (1) considering how high PIUs presence should impact the relationship between adolescent personality and the quality of their relationships with peers; (2) acknowledging the role of PIU as a regulation strategy for identity difficulties and aggression dysregulation.","output":"Problematic internet use as a moderator between personality dimensions and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to perform a theoretical reflection on the historical-social foundations of the COVID-19 pandemic The &quot;capital worldization&quot;, &quot;capital-imperialism&quot;, &quot;space-time compression&quot;, and &quot;structural crisis of capital&quot;categories are conjured from the historical materialistic-theoretical matrix, outlining a course that transcends the limits of Health Sciences to understand global health, of which the COVID-19 pandemic is an expression We then return to the field of health, when the category of &quot;social determination of health&quot;allows elucidating the bases of the pandemic studied We show that, other elements typical of the current phase of contemporary capitalism have become universal besides the SARS-CoV-2 characteristics or the dynamics of the rapid movement of people and objects around the world, unifying the health social determination process","output":"A pandemia de COVID-19 para alm das Cincias da Sade: reflex?es sobre sua determina??o social"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inhalation of ambient SARS-CoV-2-containing bioaerosols leads to infection and pandemic airborne transmission in susceptible populations. Filter-based respirators effectively reduce exposure but complicate normal respiration through breathing zone pressure differentials; therefore, they are impractical for long-term use. Objectives: We tested the comparative effectiveness of a prototyped miniaturized electrostatic precipitator (mEP) on a filter-based respirator (N95) via the removal of viral bioaerosols from a simulated, inspired air stream. Methods: Each respirator was tested within a 16 L environmental chamber housed within a Class III biological safety cabinet within biosafety level 3 containment. SARS-CoV-2-containing bioaerosols were generated in the chamber, drawn by a vacuum through each respirator, and physical particle removal and viral genomic RNA were measured distal to the breathing zone of each device. Measurements and Main Results: The mEP respirator removed particles (96.5  0.4%), approximating efficiencies of the N95 (96.9  0.6%). The mEP respirator similarly decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (99.792%) when compared to N95 removal (99.942%), as a function of particle removal from the airstream distal to the breathing zone of each respirator. Conclusions: The mEP respirator approximated the performance of a filter-based N95 respirator for particle removal and viral RNA as a constituent of the SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols generated for this evaluation.

The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the role of preoperative computed tomography (CT) screening for COVID-19 in a population of COVID-19 asymptomatic patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Between the 29th of March and the 26th of May 2020, patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 underwent a CT-scan the day before surgery, with reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) reserved for abnormal scan results. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of abnormal scans, which was evaluated using the CO-RADS score, a COVID-19 specific grading system. In a secondary analysis, the rate of abnormal scans was compared between the screening cohort and matched historical controls who underwent routine preoperative CT-screening prior to the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. Of the 109 patients that underwent CT-screening, an abnormal scan result was observed in 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.2C14.0%). One patient, with a normal screening CT, was tested positive for COVID-19, with the first positive RT-PCR on the ninth day after surgery. A rate of preoperative CT-scan abnormalities of 8% (n = 8) was found in the unexposed historical controls (P > 0.999). In asymptomatic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative screening for COVID-19 using computed tomography will identify pulmonary abnormalities in a small percentage of patients that do not seem to have COVID-19.

National valuation studies are costly, with 1000 face-to-face interviews recommended, and some countries may deem such studies infeasible. Building on previous studies exploring sample size, we determined the effect of sample size and alternative model specifications on prediction accuracy of modeled coefficients in EQ-5D-5L value set generating regression analyses. Methods. Data sets (n = 50 to 1000) were simulated from 3 valuation studies, resampled at the respondent level and randomly drawn 1000 times with replacement. We estimated utilities for each subsample with leave-one-out at the block level using regression models (8 or 20 parameter; with or without a random intercept; time tradeoff [TTO] data only or TTO + discrete choice experiment [DCE] data). Prediction accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), was calculated by comparing to censored mean predicted values to the left-out block in the full data set. Linear regression was used to estimate the relative effect of changes in sample size and each model specification. Results. Results showed that doubling the sample size decreased RMSE by on average 0.012. Effects of other model specifications were smaller but can when combined compensate for loss in prediction accuracy from a small sample size. For models using TTO data only, 8-parameter models clearly outperformed 20-parameter models. Adding a random intercept, or including DCE responses, also improved mean RMSE, most prominently for variants of the 20-parameter models. Conclusions. The prediction accuracy impact of further increases in sample size after 300 to 500 were smaller than the impact of combining alternative modeling choices. Hybrid modeling, use of constrained models, and inclusion of random intercepts all substantially improve the expected prediction accuracy. Beyond a minimum of 300 to 500 respondents, the sample size may be better informed by other considerations, such as legitimacy and representativeness, than by the technical prediction accuracy achievable. HIGHLIGHTS: Increases in sample size beyond a minimum in the range of 300 to 500 respondents provide smaller gains in expected prediction accuracy than alternative modeling approaches. Constrained, nonlinear models; time tradeoff + discrete choice experiment hybrid modeling; and including a random intercept all improved the prediction accuracy of models estimating values for the EQ-5D-5L based on data from 3 different valuation studies.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients were significantly more likely to report a coronavirus disease 2019 exposure (odds ratio (OR), 13.17 [3.87-44.9]), have gastrointestinal symptoms (OR, 3.81 [1.02-14.19]), and have a significantly higher odds of having abnormal laboratory values including high-sensitivity troponin T (OR, 13 [4.0-42.2]), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (OR, 8.4 [2.3-30.1]), D-dimer (OR, 13 [1.6-103]), and ferritin (OR, 7.8 [2.2-27.2]). There were also differences between groups in inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (median, 134.45 mg/L vs 12.6 mg/L; P < 0.05) and procalcitonin (1.71 ng/mL vs 0.14 ng/mL; P < 0.001).

Diagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are considered the gold standard for testing, but are labor-intensive and/or involve creating probe molecules specific to the virus. We propose Raman spectroscopy as an alternative method of detection because it can be label-free and can offer identifying information on many analytes within a sample. Specifically, we are developing a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) Raman spectrometer using an incoherent excitation source that emits the hydrogen Lyman- line radiation at 121.57 nm. The main benefit of using a VUV source is that the Raman scattering cross-section is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength, which means that VUV photons would yield several orders of magnitude higher scattering cross-sections than excitation in the visible or near-infrared. In addition, the 121.57 nm wavelength transmits up to 2 cm in dry air, so the analyte can be oriented in standard testing formats. We have been successful in producing strong and consistent HLA emission using both a dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma source and a commercial source. In the near future, we expect to produce consistent Raman signatures in solid and liquid media.

A triage tool is needed to define older patients with individual advantage to be considered for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer.Methods: This multicentre observational cohort study included patients over 60 admitted into 7 ICUs between 7th March and 7th May 2020. The primary objective was to evaluate age impact on 30-day mortality, to construct a multivariate prognostic model. This analysis explores the prediction value of geriatric parameters 1 month before ICU admission. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04422340.Findings: Among 290 screened patients, 231 were included in the cohort. In univariate analysis, factors associated with decreased day-30 survival were: age>75 (OR 482 [95%CI: 256-906]), three or more CIRS-G grade 2 comorbidities (OR 249 [95%CI: 136-456]), impaired ADL (Activities of Daily Living), (OR 486 [95%CI: 244-972]), impaired IADL8 (Instrumental ADL, 8 variables, OR 633 [95%CI: 331-1210], p<0001), frailty according Fried score (OR 433 [95%CI: 203-924] or the Clinical Frailty Score5 (OR 379 [95%CI: 176-815), six months fall history (OR 346 [95%CI: 158-763]).

The pandemic has placed healthcare providers and systems under unprecedented amounts of strain with potential consequences that have not yet been fully elucidated. This multilevel project aims to explore resilient performance with the purpose of improving the understanding of how healthcare has adapted during the pandemics rampage, the processes involved and the consequences on working conditions, ethics and patient safety. METHODS: An emerging explorative multilevel design based on grounded theory methodology is applied. Open and theoretical sampling is performed. Empirical data are gathered over time from written narratives and qualitative interviews with staff with different positions in healthcare organisations in two Swedish regions. The participants first-person stories are complemented with data from the healthcare organisations internal documents and national and international official documents. ANALYSIS: Experiences and expressions of resilient performance at different system levels and times, existing influencing risk and success factors at the microlevels, mesolevels and macrolevels and inter-relationships and consequences in different healthcare contexts, are explored using constant comparative analysis. Finally, the data are complemented with the current literature to develop a substantive theory of resilient performance during the pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project is ethically approved and recognises the ongoing strain on the healthcare system when gathering data. The ongoing pandemic provides unique possibilities to study system-wide adaptive capacity across different system levels and times, which can create an important basis for designing interventions focusing on preparedness to manage current and future challenges in healthcare. Feedback is provided to the settings to enable pressing improvements.

Here we compare characteristics in children with elevated ALT (E-ALT) in two distinct manifestations of the infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome-children (MIS-C) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients &#8804;21 years of age with positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. E-ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were obtained to describe differences in children with and without E-ALT in COVID-19 and MIS-C. RESULTS: E-ALT was detected in 36% of the 291 patients; 31% with COVID-19, and 51% with MIS-C. E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with obesity (P < .001), immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P = .01). In the regression models, E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with higher c-reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01) after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with E-ALT and MIS-C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P = .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS-C, male gender (OR 5.3, P = .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with increased odds of E-ALT. Children with E-ALT in both cohorts had significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS-C had 2.3-fold increased risk of E-ALT compared to COVID-19. No association was found between E-ALT and mortality. CONCLUSION: E-ALT with SARS-CoV-2 presents as elevated transaminases without hepatic synthetic dysfunction.

At cold temperatures, trehalose can be used to substitute water, inhibit the solid-liquid transition phase of the PLT membrane, and stop Glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) polymerization. In this study, we evaluated the potential of trehalose for reducing the negative effects of cold storage on the apoptosis and the clearance rates of PLTs after long-term storage at cold. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, PLT concentrates (PCs) were maintained for five days in the different circumstances. PLTs were subsequently counted by using an automated hematology analyzer. Also water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay was performed to estimate the viability of PLTs. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH) was determined by a biochemical analyzer. And human active caspase-3 levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Also, we applied flow cytometry technique. Results PLTs count and viability were higher, while LDH amount was lower in trehalose-treated PLTs when compared with two other groups (P=0.03). The highest increase in the amount of caspase-3 levels in the PLTs was observed at 4C. However, trehalose-treated and 4C PLTs had a lower amount of active caspase-3 in comparison with 4C PLTs. The level of PS expression on PLTs was lower in the trehalose-treated PLTs in compared with the two other groups (P=0.03). PLTs ingestion by HepG2 cells was enhanced in the 4C-stored PLTs.

Nurse burnout is related to nurses deteriorating mental health and poorer patient care quality and thus, is a significant concern in healthcare. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the world and distressed the healthcare systems. Because of the bodys stress mechanism, it is vital to examine the current prevalence of nurse burnout and understand it at a biological level, using an epigenetic biomarker, telomere length. PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the Peri-Operative and Labor & Delivery settings pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the effects of burnout on absolute telomere length. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study assessing the prevalence of nurses burnout and the relationships between nurses burnout and telomere length. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to stop the study during the mid of data collection. Even though the study was not designed to capture changes before and during the pandemic, we analyzed two groups data before and during the pandemic. The study took place in a US hospital. Nurses in the hospitals Operating Room, Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, and Labor & Delivery Unit participated in the study. Maslach Burnout Inventory survey and nurses demographics were administered online. Telomere length was measured via finger-prick blood. RESULTS: 146 nurses participated in the study, with 120 participants blood samples collected. The high-level burnout rate was 70.5%. Correlation analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between nurse burnout and telomere length. However, in a multiple regression analysis, the final model contained the burnout subscale of emotional exhaustion, years as an RN, and work units nursing care quality. There was a low degree of departure from normality of the mean absolute telomere length in the pre-pandemic group and a substantial degree of departure in the during-pandemic group. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse burnout is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, and this study indicates that nurses currently experience high levels of burnout. Nurses cellular biomarker, telomere length, is shorter in the group of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Appropriate measures should be implemented to decrease nurses burnout symptoms and improve nurses psychological and physical health. Nurses, especially those younger than 60, report higher burnout symptoms, particularly emotional exhaustion. This study indicates the need for intervention to promote nurses health during the pandemic and beyond. If not appropriately managed, nurse burnout may continue to be a significant issue facing the healthcare system.","output":"The prevalence of nurse burnout and its association with telomere length pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this research is to explore the potential impact of Lean Six Sigma practices on supply chain resilience proposing a conceptual framework.

Methods: Observational cohort study of all the critically ill patients indicated for ECMO support from January 1 to May 1, 2020, in all 62 authorized hospitals in Wuhan, China. Results: Among the 168 patients enrolled, 74 patients actually received ECMO support and 94 not were analyzed. The in-hospital mortality of the ECMO supported patients was significantly lower than non-ECMO ones (71.6 vs. 85.1%, P = 0.033), but the role of ECMO was affected by patients' age (Logistic regression OR 0.62, P = 0.24). As for the ECMO patients, the median age was 58 (47C66) years old and 62.2% (46/74) were male. The 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality of these ECMO supported patients were 32.4, 68.9, and 74.3% respectively. Patients survived to discharge were younger (49 vs. 62 years, P = 0.042), demonstrated higher lymphocyte count (886 vs. 638 cells/uL, P = 0.022), and better CO(2) removal (PaCO2 immediately after ECMO initiation 39.7 vs. 46.9 mmHg, P = 0.041). Age was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality of the ECMO supported patients, and a cutoff age of 51 years enabled prediction of in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 55%. The surviving ECMO supported patients had longer ICU and hospital stays (26 vs. 18 days, P = 0.018; 49 vs. 29 days, P = 0.001 respectively), and ECMO procedure was widely carried out after the supplement of medical resources after February 15 (67.6%, 50/74).

Two primary outcomes were ICU admission and mortality compared to COVID-19 positive patients in general hospital admission. Demographic, vitals, symptoms, imaging findings, comorbidities, and laboratory tests at presentation were collected. Predictions of mortality and ICU admission were made using machine learning with 80% training and 20% testing. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Results: A total of 635 patients were included in the analysis (age 6011, 40.2% female). The top 6 mortality predictors were age, procalcitonin, C-creative protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and lymphocytes.

Available evidence shows that older people are highly vulnerable and more likely to have adverse health outcomes. In Bangladesh, the older population is rapidly increasing, living with various disadvantaged socio-economic conditions, including inadequate access and healthcare services. These disparities are likely to increase during the COVID-19, resulting in high morbidity and mortality among them. Thus, we have examined the health vulnerabilities of older persons due to the COVID-19 pandemic using content analysis. We have analyzed 102 content collected from various online and printed articles published in newspapers, journals, and other relevant sources. The study has found increased health risks, deteriorated mental health, and poor health system functioning during the pandemic and its impact on older persons in Bangladesh. Strengthening health systems through an integrated model with capacity development of existing health care providers to deal with elderly health problems, including mental health and psychosocial wellbeing;promoting preventive measures, facilitating access to healthcare is required.

The objective of this study was to determine if specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions affect patient experience scores for children seen in the emergency department. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in the emergency department of a large quaternary care children's hospital on patients who were discharged to home and later completed a National Research Corporation Health patient experience survey. We matched the survey results to electronic health record (EHR) data and were able to extract demographics, operational metrics, and order information for each patient. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to determine the association of image acquisition, laboratory test ordering, medication administration, and discharge prescribing with likelihood to recommend the facility as our measure of patient experience. RESULTS: Of the 4103 patients who met inclusion criteria for the study, 75% strongly recommended the facility. Longer wait times were associated with lower patient experience scores [odds ratio (OR) per waiting room hour increase, 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-0.81]. Significant diagnostic factors associated with higher patient experience included magnetic resonance imaging ordering (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.00-5.67), x-ray ordering (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42), and electrocardiogram ordering (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44). Of the treatment factors studied, only antibiotic prescribing at discharge was found to have a significant positive association with patient experience (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.63). CONCLUSION: The positive association between more intensive diagnostic workups and patient experience could have implications on the utility of patient experience scores to evaluate pediatric care teams.

Digital technologies have been leveraged to enhance contact tracing in community settings. However, within complex hospital environments, where patient and staff movement and interpersonal interactions are central to care delivery, tools for contact tracing and cluster detection remain limited. We aimed to develop a system to promptly, identify contacts in infectious disease exposures and detect infectious disease clusters. Methods We prototyped a 3D mapping tool 3-Dimensional Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (3D-DOSS), to have a spatial representation of patients in the hospital inpatient locations. Based on the AutoCAD drawings, the hospital physical spaces are built within a game-development software to obtain accurate digital replicas. This concept borrows from the way gamers interact with the virtual world/space, to mimic the interactions in physical space, like the SIMS franchise. Clinical, laboratory and patient movement data is then integrated into the virtual map to develop syndromic and disease surveillance systems. Risk assignment to individuals exposed is through mathematical modeling based on distance coordinates, room type and ventilation parameters and whether the disease is transmitted via contact, droplet or airborne route. Results We have mapped acute respiratory illness (ARI) data for the period September to December 2018. We identified an influenza cluster of 10 patients in November 2018. In a COVID-19 exposure involving a healthcare worker (HCW), we identified 44 primary and 162 secondary contacts who were then managed as per our standard exposure management protocols. MDRO outbreaks could also be mapped. Conclusion Through early identification of at-risk contacts and detection of infectious disease clusters, the system can potentially facilitate interventions to prevent onward transmission. The system can also support security, environmental cleaning, bed assignment and other operational processes. Simulations of novel diseases outbreaks can enhance preparedness planning as health systems that had been better prepared have been more resilient in this current pandemic.

These compounds may induce acute kidney injury and are not recommended in patients with poor renal function, such as kidney transplant (KTx) recipients. METHODS: The records of 42 KTx recipients with COVID-19 were reviewed. Some of them were receiving antiretrovirals (n = 10) or RDV (n = 8) as part of COVID-19 management. Most patients were male (71%) and their median age was 52 years. The median glomerular filtration rate in these patients was 56 ml/min. Regarding disease severity, 36% had mild disease, 19% had moderate disease, 31% had severe disease, and 12% had critical disease. Subgroups, i.e., patients receiving antiretrovirals, RDV, or no antivirals, were comparable in terms of patient age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. RESULTS: Seven patients (16.6%) died during hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was found in 24% of KTx recipients at admission. Upon discharge, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased in 32% and decreased in 39% of the KTx recipients compared with the admission rate. The decrease was more prevalent in the RDV group (80%) compared with KTx recipients without any antiviral treatment (29%) (p < 0.05). Most patients (62%) returned to baseline eGFR values within 1 month of discharge. The proportion was similar between the patients receiving antiviral treatment and those not receiving this treatment.

METHODS Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide-compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. RESULTS Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5-31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm (2) (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft.

Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Qubec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Qubec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable.

METHODS Total RNA was extracted from right atrial tissue of a patient with right heart failure resected during a valvular replacement surgery by Trizol one-step method, and the full-length ACE-2 encoding gene was acquired by RT-nested-PCR. The ACE-2 encoding gene was then cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO eukaryotic expression vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pcDNA4/ ACE-2, which was then transfected into 293 T cell and ACE-2 eukaryotic transient expression was detected by Western Blot. Syncytia inhibition assay was established to detect SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody, and compared parallelly with SARS pseudovirus neutralization assay. RESULTS The recombinant plasmid pcDNA4/ ACE-2 could express ACE-2 protein in eukaryotic cells and induce cell-cell fusion between S protein- and ACE2-expressing cells. This cell-cell fusion assay could be used to detect SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody.

TR involves focused onsite and/or virtual one\\\\on\\\\one technical assistance to nursing homes. For COVID\\\\19 TR, the most common QIN\\\\QIO\\\\reported activities include: assistance with developing and implementing policies and improved processes for hand hygiene, ensuring availability and proper use of personal protective equipment, and general infection control. CMS criteria to refer NHs for QIN\\\\QIO assistance varied over the entire study period as the program evolved. At various times, these criteria included: infection control\\\\related health inspection deficiencies, NHs located in counties designated as geographic hot spots, having 30 or more new COVID\\\\19 cases in the past week. NH participation in TR is voluntary and free\\\\of\\\\charge. The objective of this study was to assess TR impact on COVID\\\\19 incidence in NHs. STUDY DESIGN: We used a quasi\\\\experimental observational design. NHs may have started receiving TR any time between April 24, and October 28, 2020. COVID\\\\19 incidence data were obtained for May 31 through November 29, 2020 from the National Healthcare Safety Network. Each program NH was matched at the time of first QIN\\\\QIO interaction with a similar non\\\\TR NH. Matching characteristics were: overall NH star rating, health inspections star rating, bed size, state, area deprivation index, and county\\\\level COVID incidence in the month of and the month prior to first receipt of TR. We used longitudinal regression models in the period following first QIN\\\\QIO interaction to compare COVID\\\\19 incidence between NHs that received TR to matched controls that did not. Generalized estimating equations with a Poisson distribution and log\\\\link were used to model COVID\\\\19 incidence, TR status and a full set of covariates. POPULATION STUDIED: CMS\\\\certified NHs providing short\\\\stay, long\\\\stay, or both types of care. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among the 2474 NHs that received TR in the study period, 2013 were matched to 2013 similar NHs that did not. Depending on the month, COVID\\\\19 incidence after matching was similar or higher in the TR group at baseline, but all other covariates were balanced. In this preliminary analysis, NHs receiving TR had 27.7% (p\\\\value <0.0001, 95% CI: 17.2%C36.9%) lowered COVID\\\\19 incidence compared to similar NHs that did not receive TR. Effect estimates withstood early sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The TR intervention was associated with a decline in COVID\\\\19 incidence in TR NHs relative to non\\\\TR NHs. Future analyses will explore which aspects of TR and QIN\\\\QIOs may have been most effective and the attributes of nursing homes that demonstrated improvement. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: Deploying TR for quality improvement in NHs in real\\\\time demonstrated a relative improvement in infection control. CMS should consider expanding TR to a broader range of outcomes. In addition, we must continue to conduct real\\\\time evaluation of the QIN\\\\QIO program as the tools and technologies evolve to prevent infections and other negative outcomes in facilities.

Case report - Case description A 76-year-old Caucasian man, who was previously fit and independent and walked 3 miles every day presented with a 1-week history of progressive leg weakness, and inability to mobilize. He had a fall and was on the floor for 2 hours. He had a background history of hypercholesterolemia and was on atorvastatin for 15 years. On his vital observation, he was found tachypnoeic, tachycardic, and hypoxic. He had a right upper lobe crackle but he didnt have respiratory symptoms. His muscle power in his leg was 3/5 with carpet burns on knees and elbow. Initial investigation showed raised inflammatory marker CRP 412mg/L, AKI stage 1, and CK 43400 IU/L. His CXR showed dense right upper lobe consolidation. Legionella urinary antigen was positive. Myositis myoblot, ANA, ANCA negative. COVID-19 swab negative. Treated with IV antibiotic, supplemental oxygen, and IV fluid. Transferred to ITU due to worsening of hypoxia and kidney function. Interestingly, the CK level had improved significantly within 48 hours along with clinical improvement in his symptoms. There was no role of steroid or immunosuppressant due to his significant clinical improvement. On day 7 he was off oxygen, kidney function improved, had physiotherapy, and transferred to ward and on day 10 he was ambulant and discharged home. Case report - Discussion To date, very few case reports of myositis in a patient with atypical pneumonia have been reported. The mechanism underlying acute myositis in atypical pneumonia is still unknown. The present analysis points out that the organism underlying atypical bacterial pneumonia may occasionally invade the muscle tissue thereby inducing both myositis and secondary kidney damage.

These reductions have resulted in a savings to the public of about $40 million/day, or $1 billion since the order went into effect. Simultaneous to the reduction in injury crashes, there were fewer people treated by Sacramento region hospitals and trauma centers for crash-related injuries. They found that traffic volumes were up to 55% lower on certain highways after the order compared to a similar period prior to the order, which may account for the reduced number of collisions.

While the impacts from this catastrophe are still being measured, it is important to understand how this pandemic impacted existing health care systems. As such, the objective of this study was to quantify its effects on trauma volume at an urban Level 1 trauma center in one of the earliest and most significantly affected US cities. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020 was completed. The total trauma volume in the years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019) was compared to the volume in 2020. These data were then further stratified to compare quarterly volume across all 4 years. RESULTS: A total of 4138 trauma patients were treated in the emergency room throughout 2020 with 4124 seen during 2019, 3774 during 2018, and 3505 during 2017 in the pre-COVID-19 time period.

Coronavirus infection often begins in the nasopharynx and destroys the olfactory epithelium. Despite many studies, little progress has been made in the treatment of coronavirus. This study aimed to further investigate the pathogenicity of coronavirus to reduce its infection by examining the virus function in the body and its stages of infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the aim of investigating the coronavirus and its effect on the human respiratory system from 1992 to 2020, this study examined the coronavirus and its different aspects and tried to answer whether there is an association between pneumonia and immune cells. This study was conducted in April 2020 and to obtain the related papers on the characteristics of the virus, Nature, ISC Pubmed, Medline WHO, NCBI, and PsycINFO databases were used. Out of 284 papers, 53 were used in this study. RESULT: Studies have shown that avoiding infected areas and strengthening the immune system inhibit the virus to bind the mucosal layers. Given the important role of acquired immunity and lymphocytes against coronavirus, it is necessary to pay attention to boost the immune system in adults and the elderly. Antioxidants help reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation in the immune system thus help it regenerate better. The results showed that children are susceptible to the virus though have lower mortality and clinical manifestations than adults.

Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA. Ribosomal frameshifting most commonly relies on a slippery site and an adjacent stable RNA structure to stall translating ribosome. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the secondary structure of the octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA. Each of the five octa-repeats contains a motif (GGCGGUGGUGGCUGGG) which alone in vitro forms a G-quadruplex. Since the propensity of mRNA to form secondary structure depends on the sequence context, we set to determine the structure of the complete octa-repeat region. We assessed the structure of full-length octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysis by primer extension (SHAPE).

We show that a large fiscal expansion combined with measures to boost community health and improve the health sector's capacity to provide critical care can simultaneously improve the economy and control the spread of the disease.

DATA SOURCES: We examine radical prostatectomy in the United States and England between 2005 and 2017, using de-identified administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse in the United States and the Hospital Episodes Statistics in England. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of robotic, laparoscopic, and open surgery for radical prostatectomy. We compared the trends of adoption over time within and across countries. Next, we explored whether differential adoption patterns in the two health systems are associated with differences in volumes and patient characteristics. Finally, we explored the relationship between these adoption patterns and length of stay, 30-day readmission, and urology follow-up visits. DATA COLLECTION: Open, laparoscopic, and robotic radical prostatectomies are identified using Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS) codes in England and International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD9), ICD10, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in the United States. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 66,879 radical prostatectomies in England and 79,358 in the United States during 2005-2017. In both countries, open surgery dominates until 2009, where it is overtaken by minimally invasive surgery. The adoption of robotic surgery is faster in the United States. The adoption rates and, as a result, the observed centralization of volume, have been different across countries. In both countries, patients undergoing radical prostatectomies are older and have more comorbidities. Minimally invasive techniques show decreased length of stay and 30-day readmissions compared to open surgery. In the United States, robotic approaches were associated with lower length of stay and readmissions when compared to laparoscopic.

METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups.

To gain insight about PIF, the authors examined the medical literature and that of two other helping professions. METHODS The authors conducted a scoping review and qualitative metasynthesis of PIF in medicine, nursing and counselling/psychology. For the scoping review, four databases were searched using a combination of keywords to identify empiric studies on PIF in trainees. After a two-step screening process, thematic analysis was used to conduct the metasynthesis on screened articles. RESULTS A total of 7451 titles and abstracts were screened; 92 studies were included in the scoping review. Saturation was reached in the qualitative metasynthesis after reviewing 29 articles. CONCLUSION The metasynthesis revealed three inter-related PIF themes across the helping professions: the importance of clinical experience, the role of trainees' expectations of what a helping professional is or should be, and the impact of broader professional culture and systems on PIF. Upon reflection, most striking was that only 10 of the 92 articles examined trainee's sociocultural data, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age and socio-economic status, in a robust way and included them in their analysis and interpretation. This raises the question of whether conceptions of PIF suffer from sociocultural bias, thereby disadvantaging trainees from diverse populations and preserving the status quo of an historically white, male medical culture.","output":"Is research on professional identity formation biased?

Patients are worried about the confidentiality of their electronic medical record (EMR) which could be used to expose their identities. It is high time to revisit the confidentiality and security issues of the existing telehealth system. Intruders can perform sniffing, spoofing, or phishing operations effortlessly during the online exchange of the EMR using a digital platform. The EMR must be transmitted anonymously with a high degree of hardness of encryption by protecting the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity criteria of the patient. These requirements recommend the security of the current system to be improved. In this paper, a neural synchronization-guided concatenation of header and secret shares with the ability to transmit the EMR with an end-to-end security protocol has been proposed. This proposed methodology breaks down the EMR into the n number of secret shares and transmits to the n number of recipients. The original EMR can be reconstructed after the amalgamation of a minimum k (threshold) number of secret shares. The novelty of the technique is that one share should come from a specific recipient to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the EMR among such a predefined number of shares. In the absence of this privileged share, the original EMR cannot be reconstructed. This proposed technique has passed various parametric tests. The results are compared with existing benchmark techniques. The results of the proposed technique have shown robust and effective potential.","output":"Neural Synchronization-Guided Concatenation of Header and Secret Shares for Secure Transmission of Patients' Electronic Medical Record: Enhancing Telehealth Security for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a lack of research using objective measures about teachers physical characteristics and lifestyle. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the relationship between frequency of breakfast consumption and body size, body composition, blood pressure and lifestyle factors in teachers from Hungary. The study analyzed data collected from 99 female primary school teachers (50.6  6.6 year) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Anthropometric and resting blood pressure measurements were taken for each participant. Questionnaires were used to assess lifestyle factors (i.e., physical activity level, smoking status and eating breakfast). The frequency of eating breakfast was classified as rarely or never (0C2 days), some days (3C5 days) and regularly (6C7 days). Sixty-five percent of female teachers consumed breakfast 6C7 days/week, and this regular eating habit was positively associated with a lower risk of obesity (OR 0.29; CI: 0.10C0.80). In our sample, a higher frequency of breakfast consumption was not significantly associated with smoking (OR 2.65; CI: 0.17C1.37), hypertension (OR 0.61; CI: 0.23C1.65) and inactivity (OR 2.80; CI: 0.26C1.84).

The DustTrak monitor was used to measure PM1, PM2.5, PM10, and breathable (<4 microns) total dust during 14 procedures performed with and without the presence of natural ventilation in a dental unit. Moreover, measurements were performed near the practitioners or near the standard saliva ejectors during the different procedures. In the latter condition, reduced levels of PM10 were recorded (82.40  9.65 g/m(3) vs. 50.52  0.23 g/m(3)). Moreover, higher levels of PM (53.95  2.29 g/m(3) vs. 27.85  0.14 g/m(3)) were produced when the dental units windows were open.

The American auto industry experienced comparable pressures beginning in the 1980s with the emergence of a competitive global market. METHODS Using the United Autoworkers-General Motors (GM) cohort as a case study, we examine the impact of employment loss on these self-injury mortality events. For 29,538 autoworkers employed on or after 1 January 1970, we apply incremental propensity score interventions, a novel causal inference approach, to examine how proportional shifts in the odds of leaving active GM employment affect the cumulative incidence of self-injury mortality. RESULTS Cumulative incidence of self-injury mortality was 0.87% (255 cases) at the observed odds of leaving active GM employment ( = 1) over a 45-year period. A 10% decrease in the odds of leaving active GM employment ( = 0.9) results in an estimated 8% drop in self-injury mortality (234 cases) while a 10% increase ( = 1.1) results in a 19% increase in self-injury mortality (303 cases). CONCLUSIONS These results are consistent with the hypothesis that leaving active employment at GM increases the risk of death due to suicide or drug overdose.","output":"The Impact of Job Loss on Self-injury Mortality in a Cohort of Autoworkers: Application of a Novel Causal Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the views and emotional reactions of patients towards the suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are the factors affecting their psychological distress? DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients' emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (na?=a?181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (Ba?=a?0.145, Pa?=a?0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (Ba?=a?-0.44, Pa?=a?0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. CONCLUSIONS: Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions. Anxiety related to COVID-19 and disagreement with treatment suspension were found to be significantly associated with psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of their background characteristics. Our findings suggest the need to monitor the mental health of patients and provide psychological support should a shutdown of fertility care re-occur.","output":"Suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: views, emotional reactions and psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human resource management (HRM) consultants have a paramount role in solving current company problems, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The \\"drawstring method\\" is a simple procedure for recreating a smooth IMF. We modified the drawstring method and developed an essentially scarless method for IMF correction from small stab incisions. Methods Patients at our hospital who presented with IMF ptosis or loss of definition after breast reconstruction and required IMF correction, as well as those who requested IMF recreation for the contralateral breast, during the period spanning May 2016 to June 2019 were considered for this study. We collected and analyzed demographic data, as well as complications and postoperative outcomes. Results The new method was performed on 20 patients, with the following breakdown: IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (11 patients), IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with a breast implant (2 patients), IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with fat graft (5 patients), and IMF recreation for the contralateral breast (2 patients). Overcorrection of the IMF stabilized by 2-3 months postoperatively, resulting in a smooth and well-defined IMF. For non-breast implant cases, the implant volume increased at the lower pole. Slack in the suture was observed in only 2 patients of the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator group and in 1 patient of the breast implant group after 6 months postoperatively. Conclusions Our new method allows for the recreation of an essentially scarless, smooth, and well-defined IMF. IMF definition can be adjusted by altering the depth of the barbed suture. Since this method can be performed under local anesthesia, it offers the benefits of reducing medical costs and physical burden on patients.","output":"A Simple and Scarless Method for Inframammary Fold Correction Using a Barbed Suture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The 1980s to 1990s saw many health systems in the United States enter and exit the insurance market in the form of provider-sponsored health plans (PSHPs). Reforms and value-based reimbursement methods have stimulated health care organizations to reconsider PSHP as a logical strategy. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to examine market and organizational factors associated with PSHP ownership and motivations for engaging in PSHP after health care reforms. The resource dependence theory was used as a theoretical lens. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A sequential quantitative to qualitative mixed-methods design was used. The quantitative analysis examined data for 5,849 U.S. hospitals. Results were synthesized with qualitative findings from 10 semistructured interviews representing eight health systems in five states. RESULTS Organizational and environmental characteristics were significantly associated with PSHP ownership. Hospital and payer concentration, Medicare penetration, income, unemployment rate, government, and for-profit and metro area hospitals were associated with a lower likelihood of PSHP ownership. Salaried physician arrangements, clinically integrated network membership and adoption of other risk-bearing arrangements were associated with higher odds of PSHP ownership. Interviewees described PSHP as the culmination of the journey to value-based care and as a strategy to improve patient care, compete, and diversify revenue streams. CONCLUSIONS Both market and organizational factors are important considerations for hospitals contemplating PSHP ownership, and motivations for ownership cover a broad range of financial, competitive, strategic, and mission-based goals. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Hospitals considering PSHP ownership must carefully evaluate their competitive landscapes and organizational resources to ensure optimal conditions for this strategy. PSHP ownership has high start-up costs and requires a long-term organizational commitment.","output":"Environmental and organizational correlates and motivations for provider-sponsored health plan ownership in the post-reform era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of eHealth tools (eg, the internet, mobile apps, and connected devices) in the management of chronic diseases and for rheumatoid arthritis is growing. eHealth may improve the overall quality of care provided to patients with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to describe eHealth use by patients with rheumatoid arthritis in France. The secondary objectives were to identify associations between patient demographics and disease characteristics and the use of eHealth tools, and assess their expectations of eHealth. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, multicenter study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, were recruited from 5 university hospitals (Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, Montpellier, and Toulouse). Patients completed an anonymous self-questionnaire, including demographic data, evaluating their eHealth use (ie, access, support, frequency of use, type of use, and reason for use). The rheumatologist in charge of each patient completed an independent medical questionnaire on disease characteristics, activity of rheumatoid arthritis, and treatments. Data were collected between December 2018 and July 2019. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 575 participants, with a mean age of 62 (SD 13) years, 447 (77.7%) of whom were female. Overall, 82.2% (473/575) of the participants had access to eHealth through a computer (402/467, 86.1%), tablet (188/467, 40.2%), or smartphone (221/467, 47.3%). Of these, 36.4% (170/467) of the participants used the internet for health in general, and 28.7% (134/467) used it specifically for rheumatoid arthritisCrelated reasons. All these 134 patients used eHealth to learn about disease pathology, and 66.4% (89/134) of them used it as a tool to help monitor rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients (87/125, 69.6%) had a paper file, 19.2% (24/125) used a digital tool (spreadsheets, 10/125, 8%; mobile app, 9/125, 7.2%; or website, 5/125, 4%), and 24.8% (31/125) did not use any tools for monitoring. Few patients (16/125, 12.8%) used tools for treatment reminders. About 21.6% (27/125) of the patients using eHealth used a specific app for rheumatoid arthritis. Univariate analysis showed that age, education level, employment status, treatment, comorbidities, membership of a patient association, and patient education program were associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. Multivariate analysis showed that membership of a patient association (odds ratio [OR] 5.8, 95% CI 3.0-11.2), use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), and comorbidities (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8) remained associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. Recommendation by a doctor (225/330, 68.2%), ease of use (105/330, 31.8%), and data security (69/330, 20.9%) were factors favoring the use of eHealth. CONCLUSIONS: To date, few patients have used eHealth for disease management. The use of a reliable and validated eHealth tool for rheumatoid arthritis could therefore be promoted by rheumatologists and could optimize therapeutic adherence.","output":"Use of eHealth by Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Observational, Cross-sectional, Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited information is available on incidence and outcomes of COVID\\\\19 in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.","output":"Delta spike P681R mutation enhances SARS-CoV-2 fitness over Alpha variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to know the natural diet of species from Ribeir?o das Lajes reservoir, from the stomach content analysis of fishes captured in two different seasons by using gillnets.

Due to the rarity and high variability of clinical presentations, TBD-specific characteristics of MN and the mechanisms behind this predisposition are not well defined. Herein, we review recent studies on TBD patient cohorts describing myeloid transformation events and summarize efforts to develop screening and treatment guidelines for these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Preliminary studies have indicated that TBD patients have a higher prevalence of somatic genetic alterations in hematopoietic cells, an age-related phenomenon, also known as clonal hematopoiesis; increasing predisposition to MN. The CH mutational landscape in TBD differs from that observed in non-TBD patients and preliminary data suggest a higher frequency of somatic mutations in the DNA repair mechanism pathway. Although initial studies did not observe specific features of MN in TBD patients, certain events are common in TBD, such as hypocellular bone marrows. The mechanisms of MN development need further elucidation. SUMMARY: Current management options for MN-TBD patients need to be individualized and tailored as per the clinical context. Because of the high sensitivity to alkylator chemotherapy and radiation conferred by short telomeres, non-cytotoxic targeted therapies and immunotherapy are ideal therapeutic options, but these therapies are still being tested in clinical trials. Defining the mechanisms of CH evolution in TBD and identifying risk factors leading to MN evolution will allow for the development of screening and treatment guidelines for these patients.","output":"Clonal Hematopoiesis and Myeloid Neoplasms in the Context of Telomere Biology Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 corona virus disease (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc on countries, communities and households Its effect on individuals and their families, although enormous, has not been adequately explored We thus present a report on the illness experiences of three families in Ghana who had at least one member diagnosed with COVID-19 We interviewed them and recorded their commonest fears, such as death, stigmatisation and collapse of family business Respondents had a fair idea about symptoms of COVID-19, mode of transmission and safety precautions Family separation and loss of income were some of the adverse effects expressed Majority of them were hopeful that family members with COVID-19 would recover and be reunited The biopsychosocial impact of COVID-19 is tremendous and family physicians and other primary care workers have an essential role to play in addressing this","output":"Exploring the illness experiences amongst families living with 2019 coronavirus disease in Ghana: three case reports.

There is an urgent need to evolve new containment strategies that minimize civil liberty restrictions. This requires strategic economic policies to invest in what might be termed pandemic containment innovation, particularly in the development of new means of reducing virus concentrations in closed spaces, and of precision exclusion of virus transmitters from public assemblies. Such innovations and their implementation, will in turn create significant employment and boost economies. And, because such investments aim at increasing the resilience of society, healthcare and the economy to pandemics (and indeed outbreaks of respiratory infections in general), they are particularly sustainable.

Methods: a retrospective analysis of data from Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) database was conducted on EC patients diagnosed between 2007 and December 2018. Medical records of EC patients were manually retrieved and reviewed using medical record numbers identified from the CDH database. Demographics, clinicopathologic features and modes of treatment were extracted. A coding sheet was created a priori, and data analysed in SAS version 9.3. Results: two hundred and seventy eight (278) complete EC medical records were included in the analysis, 183 (66%) were males, mean age was 55 years (range 21-89). One hundred and fifty six (156) (56%) resided in Lusaka, the location of CDH. The age-standardized incidence for EC was 5.5 per 100,000 people (95% CI, 4.3-6.6). The commonest symptom was dysphagia (83%), 97% were diagnosed endoscopically, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% and 8.3% respectively, 65% received treatment. One hundred and twenty four (124) medical records had missing cancer staging. Of 154 medical records with complete cancer staging, 98 (35%) were diagnosed at stage 4 of which 33% were between 40 and 49 years. Conclusion: the age-standardized incidence for EC is high at CDH. Patients with EC are predominantly male, reside in Lusaka and present with late stage EC at time of diagnosis; mostly between the ages of 40-49 years.

This study examined the association between living arrangements (house occupancy numbers) and outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: Study population was drawn from the COPE Study, a multicentre cohort study. House occupancy was defined as: living alone; living with one other person; living with multiple other people; or living in a nursing/residential home. Outcomes were time from admission to mortality and discharge (Cox regression), and Day-28 mortality (logistic regression), analyses were adjusted for key comorbidities and covariates including admission: age; sex, smoking; heart failure; admission CRP; COPD; eGFR, frailty and others. RESULTS: 1584 patients were included from 13 hospitals across UK and Italy: 676 (42.7%) were female, 907 (57.3%) were male, median age was 74 years (range: 19-101). At 28 days, 502 (31.7%) had died. Median admission CRP was 67, 82, 79.5 and 83mg/L for those living alone, with someone else, in a house of multiple occupancy and in a nursing/residential home, respectively. Compared to living alone, living with anyone was associated with increased mortality: within a couple (aHR 1.39, 95%CI 1.09-1.77, p = 0.007); living in a house of multiple occupancy (aHR=1.67, 95%CI 1.17-2.38, p = 0.005); and living in a residential home (aHR=1.36, 95%CI 1.03-1.80, p = 0.031).

In many countries worldwide, high-stakes exams happening at the end of the school year determine college admissions. This paper investigates the impact of using historical data of school and high-stakes exams results to train a model to predict high-stakes exams given the available data in the Spring. The most transparent and accurate model turns out to be a linear regression model with high school GPA as the main predictor. Further analysis of the predictions reflect how high-stakes exams relate to GPA in high school for different subgroups in the population. Predicted scores slightly advantage females and low SES individuals, who perform relatively worse in high-stakes exams than in high school. Our preferred model accounts for about 50% of the out-of- sample variation in the high-stakes exam. On average, the student rank using predicted scores differs from the actual rank by almost 17 percentiles. This suggests that either high-stakes exams capture individual skills that are not measured by high school grades or that high-stakes exams are a noisy measure of the same skill.","output":"What is at Stake Without High-Stakes Exams?

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemicCrelated increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage ones mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","output":"Rise in Use of Digital Mental Health Tools and Technologies in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We describe the demographic, clinical and labo-ratory findings along with the treatment and outcomes among children meeting the case definition of Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS).

Yet, a comprehensive analysis of party communication during COVID--19 is still missing. To analyze how parties communicate about the crisis, I turn to emotions which play a vital role in influenc-ing attitudes and behavior during pandemics. Based on parties position in the political arena (government versus populist radical parties) I expect differences in emotional rhetoric and impact on public opinion. To test my hypotheses, I use word embeddings and neural network classifiers to analyze social media messages of political parties in four European countries and more than 160,000 tweets of random samples of citizens in two of these countries. Further-more, I employ fixed--effects regression models and vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to compare retweet volumes of political messages to emotional expressions in public tweets. Re-sults indicate two main findings, (1) populist radical parties communicate less about the pan-demic and strategically downplay the crisis severity while COVID-19 cases are rising;(2) increased diffusion of populist messages consistently precedes change in citizens emotional expression about the pandemic.

We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection.

They play a significant role in the pathogenesis of infections following disruption of mucosal integrity. Anaerobic organisms are usually difficult to grow and identify and hence may often be overlooked. We present a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who developed de-novo Prevotella bivia bacteremia, following tocilizumab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38 year old Caucasian male with morbid obesity and no other past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of cough, fever, chills and poor appetite for the past 10 days. Upon arrival, he was profoundly hypoxic with Spo2 70% on ambient air. He tested positive for COVID-19. On physical examination, his BMI was 62 kg/m2, he was febrile, in moderate respiratory distress, cardiopulmonary examination revealed coarse bilateral breath sounds. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. His chest radiograph demonstrated hazy opacification in both mid lungs and left lung base suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. CT chest did not reveal evidence of pulmonary embolism. Lower extremity ultrasound was however negative for a DVT. Laboratory findings was significant for elevated C-reactive protein 12.4 mg/dl. Patient was placed on heated high flow nasal cannula and received dexamethasone and tocilizumab. His respiratory status continued to worsen and he was subsequently intubated. Lower respiratory culture was positive for MSSA and patient was started cefepime and vancomycin was added as he clinically continued to decompensate. Within the next week, blood culture was positive for Prevotella bivia and his antibiotic regimen was changed to pipericillin-tazobactam. Repeat blood culture continued to be positive and this time, for Enterococcus faecalis. The antibiotic regimen was further changed to meropenem. Interestingly, on his physical examination, there was no abnormalities on his abdomen or pelvic area. CT abdomen pelvis did not shows any acute abnormalities. Following meropenem initiation, his subsequent blood cultures have been negative for any growth. Patient remains intubated with a guarded prognosis. DISCUSSION: Prevotella bivia is one of several species of bacteria in the genus Prevotella. It is an anaerobic gram negative organism that is found in the oral, vaginal, and gut microbiome. Some of the infections caused by this organism include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, otitis media, and sinusitis. Various species of Prevotella have been isolated from abscesses and burns close of the mouth, bite, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscess, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia when there is an associated respiratory tract infections. Prevotella bivia bacteremia is highly uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: As we continue to learn more about COVID-19 infection and its treatment modalities, we may come across such unusual scenarios.

The Vpu protein of HIV-1 antagonizes the antiviral activity of tetherin, and tetherin antagonists with Vpu-like activity have been identified in other viruses. In contrast, it is incompletely understood whether tetherin inhibits influenza A virus (FLUAV) release and whether FLUAV encodes tetherin antagonists. Here, we show that release of several laboratory-adapted FLUAV strains and a seasonal FLUAV strain is inhibited by tetherin, while pandemic FLUAV A/Hamburg/4/2009 is resistant. Studies with a virus-like particle system and analysis of reassortant viruses provided evidence that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is an important determinant of tetherin antagonism but requires the presence of its cognate neuraminidase (NA) to inhibit tetherin. Finally, tetherin antagonism by FLUAV was dependent on the virion context, since retrovirus release from tetherin-positive cells was not rescued, and correlated with an HA- and NA-dependent reduction in tetherin expression. In sum, our study identifies HA and NA proteins of certain pandemic FLUAV as tetherin antagonists, which has important implications for understanding FLUAV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection is responsible for substantial global morbidity and mortality, and understanding how the virus evades the immune defenses of the host may uncover novel targets for antiviral intervention. Tetherin is an antiviral effector molecule of the innate immune system which can contribute to control of viral invasion. However, it has been unclear whether FLUAV is inhibited by tetherin and whether these viruses encode tetherin-antagonizing proteins.

This study focuses on usability factors for the development of software and proposes a direction for the adoption of building information modeling in architectural design offices. This study adopts a persona method that focuses on user experience, starting with a survey conducted in two large domestic architectural offices. For developing the persona scenarios, this study provides a conceptual framework of usability, identifies user demands, and characterizes user experience. Four representative personas were developed for the representative types of users in smart working environments. The persona scenarios provide a basis that directly reflects user needs and experiences regarding the use of building information modeling software in architectural design offices. Two implications of the application of building information modeling are proposed based on the scenarios: a user-friendly working environment for smart workflows and a customized training program focusing on user experience for the use of building information modeling software.","output":"A User-Centered Approach to the Application of BIM in Smart Working Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which started at Wuhan, has shut down world economies, prompting governments to impose drastic lockdown measures of the economy and the society. As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed.","output":"Modeling the lockdown relaxation protocols of the Philippine government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: An intuitionistic fuzzy DEMATEL analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With their inherent economic and infrastructure challenges, developing countries must assess commuters travel behaviour and establish whether consumers desire for sustainable transportation is feasible or merely wishful thinking.

Twenty-two buzzards were captured and fitted with functional platform transmitter terminals. For these buzzards that departed from the capture sites, we observed a total of 65 northward migrations during 2008-2016 and a total of 55 southward migrations during 2008-2015. In spring, the eastern buzzards migrated eastward along the Seto Inland Sea in the Chugoku region or further inland. In eastern Honshu, they followed two different routes. One was to Hokkaido via the Tsugaru Peninsula from central or northern central Honshu northward along the side of the Sea of Japan in northern Honshu. The other was to Hokkaido via the Shimokita Peninsula, mainly from the Pacific Ocean side of northern Honshu, moving eastward through central Honshu. Of the 17 birds tracked, 10 summered in Sakhalin, three in Hokkaido, three in northern Honshu, and one unknown. In autumn, the buzzards retraced their northward migration routes. Of the 14 birds that were tracked the entire southward migration, 13 (92%) returned to their respective capture sites. One juvenile wintered in an area different from the capture site.

Methods: A list of IRD patients on biologics and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs in March 2020 was linked to the REACT-SCOT study, an incidence density-sampled case-control study that includes all new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Scotland since the start of the pandemic, linked to electronic health records including all prescribing in primary care. Main outcome measure: Hospitalised or fatal COVID-19 . Results: By 22 November 2021 433 of the 4633 patients treated with biologics and tsDMARDs had been diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 58 had been hospitalised and 14 died within 28 days. With all those in the population not on DMARDs as reference category, the rate ratio for hospitalised COVID-19 associated with DMARD treatment was 2.14 (95% CI 2.02 to 2.26) in those on conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs, 2.01 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.91) in those on TNF inhibitors as the only biologic agent, and 3.83 (95% CI 2.65 to 5.56) in those on other biologic agents. Among those on csDMARDs, rate ratios for hospitalised COVID-19 were lowest at NA in those on methotrexate and highest at 5.4 (95% CI 4.4 to 6.7) in those on glucocorticoids at average dose equivalent to >10 mg/day prednisolone. Conclusion: The risk of hospitalised COVID-19 is elevated in IRD patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Of these drugs, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and TNF inhibitors carry the lowest risk; JAK inhibitors and B-cell depleting agents a higher risk and prednisolone the highest risk.

Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India.

With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.","output":"Role of dopamine and gray matter density in aging effects and individual differences of functional connectomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is a marker of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness severity and increased mortality. Immunomodulatory treatments have been repurposed to improve mortality outcomes. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do immunomodulatory therapies improve survival in patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm (CCS)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were included. CCS was defined by inflammatory markers: ferritin, > 700 ng/mL; C-reactive protein (CRP), > 30 mg/dL; or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), > 300 U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups: no immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either corticosteroids, anti-IL-6 antibody (tocilizumab), or anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra) alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred seventy-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (44%-59%), diabetes (32%-46%), and cardiovascular disease (5%-14%). Patients most frequently met criteria with high LDH (76.2%) alone or in combination, followed by ferritin (63.2%) and CRP (8.4%). More than 80% of patients showed an elevated D-dimer. Patients treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab combination showed lower mortality compared with patients receiving standard-of-care (SoC) treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) and with patients treated with corticosteroids alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.83; P = .004) or in combination with anakinra (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P = .003). Corticosteroids when administered alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.76; P < .0001) or in combination with tocilizumab (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) or anakinra (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; P < .0001) improved hospital survival compared with SoC treatment. INTERPRETATION: The combination of corticosteroids with tocilizumab showed superior survival outcome when compared with SoC treatment and treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with anakinra.

MethodsModelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics data (2014-2019). Using NHS England definitions, surgical procedures were grouped into four urgency classes. Expected numbers of surgical procedures performed between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021 were modelled. Procedure deficit was estimated using conservative assumptions and the gradual reintroduction of elective surgery from the 1st June 2020. Costs were calculated using NHS reference costs and are reported as millions(M) or billions(B) of Euros({euro}). Estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Results4 547 534 (3 318 195 - 6 250 771) patients with pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021. By 31st May 2020, 749 247 (513 564 - 1 077 448) surgical procedures were cancelled. Assuming elective surgery is gradually reintroduced, 2 328 193 (1 483 834 - 3 450 043) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28th February 2021.

For automatic analysis of images, they are represented in machines by a set of semantic features. Deep Learning (DL) models are widely used to extract features from images. General deep features extracted from intermediate layers may not be appropriate to represent CXR images as they have a few semantic regions. Though the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)-based features are shown to be more appropriate for different types of images, existing BoVW features may not capture enough information to differentiate COVID-19 infection from other Pneumonia-related infections. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a new BoVW method over deep features, called Bag of Deep Visual Words (BoDVW), by removing the feature map normalization step and adding the deep features normalization step on the raw feature maps. This helps to preserve the semantics of each feature map that may have important clues to differentiate COVID-19 from Pneumonia. RESULTS: We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed BoDVW features in CXR image classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose COVID-19. Our results on four publicly available COVID-19 CXR image datasets (D1, D2, D3, and D4) reveal that our features produce stable and prominent classification accuracy (82.00% on D1, 87.86% on D2, 87.92% on D3, and 83.22% on D4), particularly differentiating COVID-19 infection from other Pneumonia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, descriptive and prospective study of children younger than 18 months, admitted to Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca of Murcia (Spain), with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, during the season of maximum incidence (December 2008-April 2009). RESULTS: A total of 235 infants were admitted, of whom 78.7% of them were aged 5 months or less. We found a positive correlation between the number of cigarettes smoked by their mothers during pregnancy and the number of hospitalization and oxygen therapy days. Children whose mothers were smokers at the time of their admission needed a greater number of oxygen therapy days. Also infants who were not breastfed needed oxygen therapy during more days. Just under one quarter (23.8%) of them had underlying diseases, with prematurity being the most frequent and a risk factor for the ongoing of oxygen therapy and hospital stay. The use of diagnostic tests, bronchodilators, corticosteroids and antibiotics was high. The onset of high temperature was associated with an increased use of antibiotics in outside and inside the hospital setting. An abnormal chest X-ray or a raised C-reactive protein was associated with a higher use of antibiotics. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the main aetiological agent, followed by Rhinovirus, Bocavirus, Adenovirus and Metapneumovirus CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospital admissions due to bronchiolitis took place during the first months of life.

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock and wildlife.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal pneumonia may occur in isolation or as one component of a larger infectious process.

For men in an intimate relationship, these symptoms disrupt couples relationships and intimacy. The symptoms also reduce quality of life for both men and their partners, who are often their primary caregivers. Management of the negative effects of cancer and its treatment is a significantly under-addressed supportive care need for these men and their intimate partners. To address these unmet supportive care needs, our interdisciplinary team developed and pilot tested the usability and feasibility of an evidence-based, couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention, Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples (PERC). Based on the adapted stress and coping theoretical framework and developed with stakeholder involvement, PERC aims to improve quality of life for both men and their partners by enhancing their positive appraisals, self-efficacy, social support, and healthy behaviors for symptom management. METHODS: We will test the efficacy of PERC using a population-based, geographically and demographically diverse cohort in a randomized controlled trial. Primary aim: Assess if patients and partners receiving PERC will report greater improvement in their cancer-related quality of life scores than those in the control group (usual care plus the National Cancer Institute prostate cancer website) at 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Secondary aim: Test if patients and partners in PERC will report significantly more positive appraisals and higher levels of coping resources at follow-ups than those in the control group. Exploratory aim: Determine if patient race and ethnicity, education, type of treatment, or couples relationship quality moderate the effects of PERC on patient and partner QOL at follow-ups. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a novel model for self-managing chronic illness symptoms that impact couples relationships, intimacy, and quality of life. It addresses the National Institute of Nursing Researchs goal to develop and test new strategies for symptom self-management to help patients and caregivers better manage their illness and improve quality of life.

To date, there is no proven curative treatment for this virus; as a result, prevention remains to be the best strategy to combat coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been proposed to play a role in coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, there is no conclusive evidence on its impact on COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the present review aimed to summarize the available evidence regarding the association between Vitamin D levels and the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic literature search of databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane/Wiley library, Scopus, and SciELO) were conducted from May 15, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Studies that assessed the effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19/SARS-2 infection were considered for the review. The qualities of the included studies were evaluated using the JBI tools. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was conducted and odds ratio with their 95%CI were reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Results: The electronic and supplementary searches for this review yielded 318 records from which, only 14 of them met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis indicated that vitamin D deficient individuals were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. The pooled analysis showed that individuals with Vitamin-D deficiency were 80% more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection as compared to those who have sufficient Vitamin D levels (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.72, 1.88). Begg's test also revealed that there was no significant publication bias between the studies (P = 0.764). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was relatively higher in the case-control study design (OR = 1.81). Conclusions: In conclusion, low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The limited currently available data suggest that sufficient Vitamin D level in serum is associated with a significantly decreased risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"The Impact of Vitamin D Level on COVID-19 Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is no pharmacological intervention on the treatment of hypoxemia and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Objective: The objective of the study was to study the effect of the reduced form of methylene blue (MB) on the improvement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR). Methods: In an academic medical center, 80 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either oral MB along with standard of care (SOC) (MB group, n = 40) or SOC only (SOC group, n=40). The primary outcomes were SpO2 and RR on the 3rd and 5th days. The secondary outcomes were hospital stay and mortality within 28 days. Results: In the MB group, a significant improvement in SpO2 and RR was observed on the 3rd day (for both, p < 0.0001) and also the 5th day (for both, p < 0.0001). In the SOC group, there was no significant improvement in SpO2 (p = 0.24) and RR (p = 0.20) on the 3rd day, although there was a significant improvement of SpO2 (p = 0.002) and RR (p = 0.01) on the 5th day. In the MB group in comparison to the SOC group, the rate ratio of increased SpO2 was 13.5 and 2.1 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. In the MB group compared with the SOC group, the rate ratio of RR improvement was 10.1 and 3.7 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. The hospital stay was significantly shortened in the MB group (p = 0.004), and the mortality was 12.5% and 22.5% in the MB and SOC groups, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of MB to the treatment protocols significantly improved SpO2 and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, which resulted in decreased hospital stay and mortality.

To identify subgroups likely to benefit from this intervention, we evaluated the relationship between comorbidities and need for hospitalization in US adolescents presenting with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed presence of comorbidities and need for hospitalization within 28 days of diagnosis for adolescents in the PIDTRAN registry, a multicenter retrospective cohort of US pediatric patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities assessed included obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes (DM), immunosuppressive disease or treatment (IS), sickle cell disease (SCD), congenital/acquired heart disease (CHD), neurologic disease/neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), medical-related technology dependence (MTD), and pulmonary disease requiring daily inhaled corticosteroids (PD). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine race/ethnicity-adjusted associations between comorbidities and hospitalization. RESULTS: 1574 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 180 (11.4%) were hospitalized within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. In a race/ethnicity-adjusted model, the following comorbidities were independently associated with increased odds of hospitalization: IS (OR 10.8 [95%CI 5.4 C 21.7]); CKD (OR 5.1 [95%CI 1.0 C 25.6]); DM (OR 4.2 [95%CI 1.7 C 10.6]); SCD (OR 3.4 [95%CI 1.1 C 10.6]).

The public health emergency management system in China has played an essential role in handling the response to the outbreak, which has been appreciated by the World Health Organization and some countries. Hence, it is necessary to conduct an overall analysis of the development of the health emergency management system in China. This can provide a reference for scholars to aid in understanding the current situation and to reveal new research topics. METHODS: We collected 2247 international articles from the Web of Science database and 959 Chinese articles from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database. Bibliometric and mapping knowledge domain analysis methods were used in this study for temporal distribution analysis, cooperation network analysis, and co-word network analysis. RESULTS: The first international article in this field was published in 1991, while the first Chinese article was published in 2005. The research institutions producing these studies mainly existed in universities and health organizations. Developed countries and European countries published the most articles overall, while eastern China published the most articles within China. There were 52 burst words for international articles published from 1999C2018 and 18 burst words for Chinese articles published from 2003C2018. International top-ranked articles according to the number of citations appeared in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2014, 2015, and 2016, while the corresponding Chinese articles appeared in 2003, 2004, 2009, and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in the regional and economic distribution of international and Chinese cooperation networks. International research is often related to timely issues mainly by focusing on emergency preparedness and monitoring of public health events, while China has focused on public health emergencies and their disposition. International research began on terrorism and bioterrorism, followed by disaster planning and emergency preparedness, epidemics, and infectious diseases.

Typically, blur causes edge extension, which brings shape changes in infection regions. Tchebichef moments (TM) have been verified efficiently in shape representation. Intuitively, disease progression of same patient over time during the treatment is represented as different blur degrees of infection regions, since different blur degrees cause the magnitudes change of TM on infection regions image, blur of infection regions can be captured by TM. With the above observation, a longitudinal objective quantitative evaluation method for COVID-19 disease progression based on TM is proposed.

Next, the gradient of a fused ROI image is calculated to represent the shape. The gradient image of fused ROI is separated into same size blocks, a block energy is calculated as quadratic sum of non-direct current moment values.

The decline in incidence of injuries in the interventional arm was higher than that in the control arm (50.4% vs 12.7%; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: School based educational intervention using child safety and injury prevention modules is effective in reducing unintentional injuries among school children over a 10-month period.","output":"Effectiveness of School-Based Interventions in Reducing Unintentional Childhood Injuries: A Cluster Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To identify, appraise and synthesise existing design evidence for inpatient stroke rehabilitation facilities; to identify impacts of these built environments on the outcomes and experiences of people recovering from stroke, their family/caregivers and staff. DESIGN A convergent segregated review design was used to conduct a systematic review. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched for articles published between January 2000 and November 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies investigating the impact of the built environment of inpatient rehabilitation facilities on stroke survivors, their family/caregivers and/or staff. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors separately completed the title, abstract, full-text screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Extracted data were categorised according to the aspect of the built environment explored and the outcomes reported. These categories were used to structure a narrative synthesis of the results from all included studies. RESULTS Twenty-four articles were included, most qualitative and exploratory. Half of the included articles investigated a particular aspect of the built environment, including environmental enrichment and communal areas (n=8), bedroom design (n=3) and therapy spaces (n=1), while the other half considered the environment in general. Findings related to one or more of the following outcome categories: (1) clinical outcomes, (2) patient activity, (3) patient well-being, (4) patient and/or staff safety and (5) clinical practice. Heterogeneous designs and variables of interest meant results could not be compared, but some repeated findings suggest that attractive and accessible communal areas are important for patient activity and well-being. CONCLUSIONS Stroke rehabilitation is a unique healthcare context where patient activity, practice and motivation are paramount.

In Austria, the largest health insurance fund covers 7 million people and has 12,000 employees, including 3700 healthcare workers (HCW). For patient and staff safety, transmission control measures were implemented and mass testing of employees for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted. An IgG SARS-CoV-2 rapid test on fingerstick blood was used as a screening test (ST), followed by serologic studies with 3 different immunoassays and confirmatory testing by a neutralization test (NT). Among 7858 employees, 144 had a positive ST and 88 were confirmed by a NT (1.12%, CI: 0.9-1.38%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the ST was 69.3% (CI: 60.5-77.2). Interestingly, 40% of the NT positive serum samples were tested negative in all 3 immunoassays. Of the total sample, 2242 HCW (28.5%) were identified. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in the prevalence of NT positives in HCW compared to non-HCW (23/2242 vs. 65/5301, p = 0.53). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was not increased among HCW.

With an exceedingly high transmission rate, COVID-19 has affected almost all the countries in the world. Absent any vaccine or specific treatment, the humanity is left with nothing but the legacy method of quarantine. However, quarantine can only be effective when combined with early diagnosis of suspected cases. With their high sensitivity and unmatched specificity, biosensors have become an area of interest for development of novel diagnostic methods. Compared to the more traditional diagnostics, nanobiotechnology introduces biosensors as different diagnostics with greater versatility in application. Today, a growing number of analytes are being accurately identified by these nanoscopic sensing machines. Several reports of validated application with real samples further strengthen this idea. As of recent, there has been a rise in the number of studies on portable biosensors. Despite the slow progression, certain devices with embedded biosensors have managed to be of diagnostic value in several countries. The perceptible increase in development of mobile platforms has revolutionized the healthcare delivery system in the new millennium. The present article reviews the most recent advancements in development of diagnostic nanobiosensors and their application in the clinical fields. KEY POINTS: a?

The purpose of this study is to gauge the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck oncology and reconstructive surgery (HNORS) practice and evaluate their practice patterns especially ones that might be impacted by COVID-19 and compare them to the current literature. METHODS This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an ICU postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic had a small impact on the surgical treatment of patients with head and neck oncology.

Over the last 18 years, we performed 11 436 KT, 70% of which from deceased donors. To mitigate the effects of reduction in the number of transplants on the waiting list, sequential measures were implemented when COVID\\\\19 was declared pandemic. METHODS: The first step was to provide SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 RT\\\\PCR testing for all symptomatic employees and patients and the compulsory use of personal protective equipment in the hospital facilities. Living donor KT were postponed, and all deceased donors and recipients were tested before the transplantation. The immunosuppressive protocols were maintained, and telehealth strategies were developed. RESULTS: Among the 1013 employees, there were 214 cases of COVID\\\\19, nine required ward hospitalization, and no deaths occurred. In 26%, the probable source of contamination was occupational. From the first patient diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 in 03/20/2020 till 10/21/2020, 523 deceased KT were performed, a 21% increase compared with 2019, with no confirmed donor\\\\derived SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Four patients were transplanted with a positive pretransplant SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test, but none of them developed the disease. Overall, of 11 875 KT followed in our center, 674 developed COVID\\\\19.

However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/AngC(1C7)/Mas axis prevents LPSCinduced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NFCB pathways. Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviralCborne Ace2 or shRNACAce2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS. LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, AngC(1C7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio. Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased AngC(1C7) levels, thus reducing LPSCinduced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects. A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2. LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NFCB pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2Cinduced blockade of p38, JNK, and NFCB phosphorylation. However, only JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and A779 pretreatment. These results suggest that the ACE2/AngC(1C7)/Mas axis has a crucial role in preventing LPSCinduced apoptosis and inflammation of PMVECs, by inhibiting the JNK/NFCB pathways.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1C7)/Mas axis prevents lipopolysaccharideCinduced apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells by inhibiting JNK/NFCB pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Trainees and investigators from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds face unique challenges to establishing successful careers in clinical and translational research.

Objective: In a two-wave longitudinal survey, we investigated the levels of parental stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of parents at two time points;during the implementation of the strictest physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2,868) and three months after the discontinuation of the protocols (T2, N = 1,489). Further, we investigated the relationships between parental stress and anxiety and depression relative to relationship quality and anger toward their children at the two aforementioned time points, including subgroups based on age, parental role, cultural background, relationship status, education level, number of children, employment status and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Methods and findings: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement points. Parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stress that parents experienced during the implementation of the distancing protocols declined when the protocols were phased out. The decrease of perceived parental stress was accompanied by a significant decrease in the symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-offs for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% at T2, respectively. The reduction in depression and anger toward their child(ren) from T1 to T2 was associated with a reduction of parental stress. Relationship quality and anger toward their child(ren) at T1 further predicted a change in the level of parental stress from T1 to T2. Conclusions: The study underlines the negative psychological impacts of the implementation of the distancing protocols on parents' health and well-being. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated with parents and families facing a social crisis such as the ongoing pandemic may contribute to the design of relevant interventions to reduce parental distress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.

We aim to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for development of COVID-19 associated acute liver injury in a large cohort in the United States. APPROACH & RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at three hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian network were assessed. Of 3381 patients, 2273 tested positive and had higher initial and peak ALT than those who tested negative. Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was > upper limit of normal (ULN) but < two times ULN, moderate if ALT was between two and five times ULN, and severe if ALT was > five times ULN. Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury. In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p<0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009). Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%). In multivariable analysis, peak ALT was significantly associated with death or discharge to hospice (OR 1.14, p=0.044), controlling for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, intubation, and renal replacement therapy.

The uterine massage group was administered transabdominal uterine massage, starting immediately after delivery of the placenta and continuing every 15 min for a duration of 2 h until the uterus hardened. The blood loss within 2 h of delivery was recorded. Level of significance was taken as p < 0.05, and the chi-square, t, and Mann-Whitney U tests as well as Spearman's correlation and linear regression were employed in the analysis of the data. The average amount blood loss within 2 h of the delivery was significantly higher in the control group than in the massage group (X = 170.49  61.46 and X = 186.20  47.59, p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was present between the uterine massage and control groups in terms of hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, and RCB pre-delivery and pre-discharge (first 24 h) values and in the use of additional uterotonics and the amount of blood loss (p < 0.05). The results of the analysis show that postpartum uterine massage has a reducing effect on the amount of PPH.","output":"Uterine massage to reduce blood loss after vaginal delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Bipolar disorder (BP) is commonly researched in digital settings. As a result, standardized digital tools are needed to measure mood. We sought to validate a new survey that is brief, validated in digital form, and able to separately measure manic and depressive severity. METHODS We introduce a 6-item digital survey, called digiBP, for measuring mood in BP. It has 3 depressive items (depressed mood, fidgeting, fatigue), 2 manic items (increased energy, rapid speech), and 1 mixed item (irritability); and recovers two scores (m and d) to measure manic and depressive severity. In a secondary analysis of individuals with BP who monitored their symptoms over 6 weeks (n = 43), we perform a series of analyses to validate the digiBP survey internally, externally, and as a longitudinal measure. RESULTS We first verify a conceptual model for the survey in which items load onto two factors (\\"manic\\" and \\"depressive\\"). We then show weekly averages of m and d scores from digiBP can explain significant variation in weekly scores from the YMRS (R2 = 0.47) and SIGH-D (R2 = 0.58). Lastly, we examine the utility of the survey as a longitudinal measure by predicting an individual's future m and d scores from their past m and d scores. CONCLUSIONS While further validation is warranted in larger, diverse populations, these validation analyses should encourage researchers to consider digiBP for their next digital study of BP.","output":"A digital self-report survey of mood for bipolar disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common abdominal surgical emergency. No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The study included 66 patients (41 pre-COVID-19; 25 post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7  3 and 9.3  3.1; P = .073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs. 19.5%; P = 0.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7  96.2 vs. 31.3  36.2 mg/dL; P = 0.042). This group presented with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis when compared to pre-COVID-19 (32 vs. 7.3%; P = 0.015). The mean hospital stay was longer in the post-COVID-19 group (5.6  5.9 vs. 3.2  4.3 days; P = 0.041). No differences were found in the time of onset of symptoms or surgical time. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic influenced the time of diagnosis of appendicitis, as well as its course, and mean hospital stay. Peritonitis was more frequently seen. As a result of the significant circumstances, delaying diagnosis and treatment of AA during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, inappropriate management of this common surgical disorder has been noticed.","output":"Influencia de la pandemia por coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) en la apendicitis aguda./ [Influence of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on acute appendicitis]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic not only cast a shadow on China's economic development but also caused phased panic and anxiety among the Chinese population At the stage when the spread of the epidemic is not completely controlled, the business activities will surely cause employees to worry and produce a work stress reaction OBJECTIVE: This study explores the impact of psychosocial stress caused by the COVID-19 epidemic on the work stress of returned workers Furthermore, we explore the boundary conditions for reducing work stress from the perspectives of perceived organizational support, perceived social support and epidemic awareness METHODS: Data were collected within two weeks after the Chinese government announced the work resumption of industrial enterprises During this period, 526 returned workers participated in the study RESULTS: The results showed that the psychosocial stress caused by the epidemic had a positive impact on work stress Both perceived organizational support and perceived that social support can alleviate the impact of psychosocial stress on work stress The moderating effect of epidemic awareness was only established in non-severe epidemic areas CONCLUSIONS: In the current period of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the conclusions of this study have a certain theoretical significance and practical value","output":"Research on the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on work stress of returning workers in china: a study based on empirical analyses of industrial enterprises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infection risks of Biden, Wallace, and the audience by Trump and the first lady were assessed during the first presidential debate.

In this work, we developed a transparent microcrystalline cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (MCC/PVA) paper with irregular pores through dissolution and regeneration of microcrystalline nanocellulose (MCC), addition of porogen reagent (NaCl) and subsequently dipping in PVA solutions. The transparent MCC paper displays high porosity (up to 90%), adjustable pore size (between 23 m and 46 m) and large thickness (from 315 m to 436 m) and high light transmission under water (>95%). Through further modification of transparent MCC paper with PVA, the obtained transparent MCC/PVA paper shows enhanced mechanical properties (dry and wet strengths), good hydrophilicity (with a contact angle of 70.8) and improved biocompatibility (cell viability up to 90%). By stacking and destacking multiple layers of the transparent MCC/PVA paper, it has been used for both 2D and 3D cell culture platforms. The transparent MCC/PVA paper under water enables both direct observation of cell morphology by optical microscope via naked eyes and fluorescence microscope after staining.

Among them, a central role has been attributed to long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, more than 200 nucleotides in length, which are also crucially involved in cancer and autoimmunity. LncRNAs epigenetically control the transcription of genes presiding over cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, by directly or indirectly binding cellular or foreign nucleic acids, including viral genomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate in silico the presence of a nucleotide sequence complementarity between the RNA genome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human ncRNA genes and to analyze any associations between SARS-CoV-2 gene-matching ncRNAs and human diseases. Methods: The FASTA sequence of each of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 genes (ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, S, E, M, N) was retrieved from NCBI.nlm.nih.gov/gene (reference sequence NC-045512.2). The ensembl.org library for human ncRNA genes was interrogated for any base-pair match and detected human ncRNAs analyzed for their functional activity. Finally, the associations between ncRNAs and human diseases were searched on GWAS databases (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas and https://www.genecards.org). Results: A total of 252 matches between SARS-CoV-2 genes and human ncRNAs were recorded (ORF1ab: 28;ORF3a: 9;ORF6: 50;ORF7a: 31;ORF7b: 16;ORF8: 23;ORF10: 5;S: 24;E: 17;M: 32;N: 17). With the exception of two small nuclear RNAs (RNVU1-4 and RNU4-74P corresponding to ORF6 and ORF10, respectively), all of them were lncRNAs, mostly expressed in testis and central nervous system under physiological conditions. Percentage of alignment ranged from 91.30% to 100%, with a mean nucleotide alignment length of 17.52.4. Polymorphic variants of these transcripts have mostly been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer and dysmetabolism. Of note, we found 13 and 15 complementarities with lncRNAs associated with immune-mediated diseases Table 1. and immunological pathways (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-12R, IL-13, IL-17, M-CSF, CXCL-10, TRAIL-R2 and IgG glycosylation), respectively.

This context has underscored the reality that drivers of customer delight in a traditional context are not the same in a crisis context. While research has tended to identify hedonic need fulfillment as key to customer well-being and, ultimately, to invoking customer delight, the majority of studies were conducted in inherently positive contexts, which may limit generalizability to more challenging contexts. Through the combined lens of transformative service research (TSR) and psychological theory on hedonic and eudaimonic human needs, we evaluate the extent to which need fulfillment is the root of customer well-being and that meeting well-being needs ultimately promotes delight. We argue that in crisis contexts, the salience of needs shifts from hedonic to eudaimonic and the extent to which service experiences fulfill eudaimonic needs determines the experience and meaning of delight. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing the critical incident technique, this research surveyed 240 respondents who were asked to explain in detail a time they experienced customer delight during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed their responses according to whether these incidents reflected the salience of hedonic versus eudaimonic need fulfillment. Findings: The results support the notion that the salience of eudaimonic needs become more pronounced during times of crisis and that service providers are more likely to elicit perceptions of delight when they leverage meeting eudaimonic needs over the hedonic needs that are typically emphasized in traditional service encounters. Originality/value: We discuss the implications of these findings for integrating the TSR and customer delight literatures to better understand how service experiences that meet salient needs produce customer well-being and delight. Ultimately, we find customer delight can benefit well-being across individual, collective and societal levels.","output":"Customer delight during a crisis: understanding delight through the lens of transformative service research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of patients contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during their hospital stay to inform the safety of hospitalization for a non-COVID-19 indication during this pandemic. METHODS: A case series of adult patients hospitalized for 2 or more nights from May 15 to June 15, 2020 at large tertiary-care hospital in the midwestern United States was reviewed. All patients were screened at admission with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Selected adult patients were also tested by IgG serology. After dismissal, patients with negative serology and PCR at admission were asked to undergo repeat serologic testing at 14-21 days after discharge. The primary outcome was healthcare-associated COVID-19 defined as a new positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on or after day 4 of hospital stay or within 7 days of hospital dismissal, or seroconversion in patients previously established as seronegative. RESULTS: Of the 2,068 eligible adult patients, 1,778 (86.0%) completed admission PCR testing, while 1,339 (64.7%) also completed admission serology testing. Of the 1,310 (97.8%) who were both PCR and seronegative, 445 (34.0%) repeated postdischarge serology testing. No healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases were detected during the study period. Of 1,310 eligible PCR and seronegative adults, no patients tested PCR positive during hospital admission (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%-0.3%).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, death probability has been assessed in a normal context that is different from those anticipated during the pandemic, particularly for the older population cluster. However, there is no such evidence of excess mortality in Malaysia to date. Therefore, this study determines the excess mortality rate for specific age groups during the pandemic outbreak in Malaysia. Before determining the excess mortality rate, this study aims to establish the efficiency of various parametrized mortality models in reference to the data set before the pandemic. This study employs the hold-out, repeated hold-out, and leave-one-out cross-validation procedures to identify the optimal mortality law for fitting the mortality data. Based on the goodness-of-fit measures (mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, sum square error, and mean square error), the Heligman-Pollard model for men and Rogers Planck model for women are considered as the optimal models. In assessing the excess mortality, both models favour the hold-out technique. When the COVID-19 mortality data are incorporated to forecast the mortality rate for people aged 60 and above, there is an excess mortality rate. However, the mens mortality rate appears to be delayed and more prolonged than the womens mortality rate.

Methods The authors searched and reviewed the medical records for cases of SEMCs. Imaging features, operative reports, and media were reviewed to accurately describe the surgical techniques employed. We recorded the level and laterality of the fistula according to the operative report and the media. Consistency analysis was performed on the dominant laterality of the cyst on preoperative axial MRI and laterality of the fistula in the operative media or report. When cyst and fistula lateralities were the same, they were considered consistent. Finally, the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to obtain patient-reported results at each follow-up. Results Thirty patients with SEMCs were identified. Fistula repair was performed in all patients. Two patients experienced cyst recurrence after surgery and were repaired during the second surgery. Based on imaging findings, SEMCs mostly occurred in the thoracolumbar junction. Most of the fistulas (87.88%) were at the T12 or L1 levels. In patients with multiple adjacent SEMCs, the fistula may be at one end of the cyst rather than in the middle level of the cyst. A fistula laterality of 72.72% was consistent with cyst laterality. The JOA improvement rate was 61.84%26.63%. Conclusion Most fistulas were always located at the T12-L1 level as well as the middle level of the cyst, which is always consistent with cyst laterality.

For example, researchers might wish to know if census tracts with a case of a rare medical condition or an outbreak of an infectious disease tend to cluster together spatially. Since few spatial clustering methods are designed for areal data, researchers often reduce the areal data to point process data (e.g., using the centroid of each areal unit) and apply methods designed for point process data, such as Ripley's K function or the average nearest neighbor method. However, since these methods were not designed for areal data, a number of issues can arise. For example, we show that they can result in loss of power and/or a significantly inflated type I error rate.

OBJECTIVE To further evaluate a vaginal antimicrobial compound as a contraceptive agent in preclinical studies utilizing a repurposed hyaluronan binding assay (HBA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Semen samples containing either neat semen or washed spermatozoa were treated with increasing concentrations of PPCM or calcium ionophore A23187 (positive control). Sperm inactivation was measured by two methods: 1) double acrosome staining (AS), and 2) a hyaluronan binding assay (HBA?). Percent inactivated sperm was compared between untreated control sperm and those treated with PPCM or A23187. RESULTS PPCM had a significant (P < 0.05) and dose-dependent effect on sperm inactivation in both assays, with HBA detecting a higher proportion of inactivated sperm than AS. PPCM did not affect sperm motility and exhibited equivalent responses in neat and washed samples. DISCUSSION Both HBA and AS confirmed that sperm were are rapidly inactivated at PPCM concentrations likely present in the vagina under actual use conditions and in a time-frame comparable to in vivo migration of sperm out of seminal plasma into cervical mucus.

METHODS: COVID-19 positive patients presenting OD were prospectively recruited from three European hospitals. Baseline clinical and olfactory evaluations were performed within the first 2 weeks after OD onset and repeated at 30 and 60 days. In a subgroup of patients, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were measured in serum, saliva and nasal secretions at 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 288 COVID-19 patients with OD were included in the study. Two weeks after the onset of the loss of smell, 52.4% of patients had OD on psychophysical tests, including 113 cases (39.2%) of anosmia and 38 cases (13.2%) of hyposmia. At 60-day follow-up, 25.4% of the patients presented persistent OD. There was no significant correlation between sex, age, viral load on nasopharyngeal swab or COVID-19 severity and poor olfactory outcome. In a subgroup of 63 patients, it was demonstrated that patients with poor olfactory outcomes at 60 days had lower levels of salivary and nasal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1, but similar levels of antibodies in the serum. CONCLUSIONS: No clinical markers predicted the evolution of OD at 60 days. Patients with poor olfactory outcome at 60 days had lower saliva and nasal antibodies, suggesting a role for local immune responses in the persistence of COVID-19 related OD.","output":"Predictive factors of smell recovery in a clinical series of 288 coronavirus disease 2019 patients with olfactory dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic hit societies in full force in 2020 and compelled people all around the world to change their lifestyle The time spent at home significantly surged during the pandemic and this change in occupancy can have a direct impact on building energy consumption COVID-19 lockdowns also accelerated the transition towards telework, a trend that many expect to last Changes in energy consumption under lockdown is thus a valuable asset to forecast how energy could be consumed in buildings in the future Here, we aim to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on the energy consumption (electricity, hot water and space heating) in residential buildings by answering these two questions: (i) Did the lockdown lead to changes in total energy consumption?, and (ii) Did the lockdown lead to changes in consumption patterns (i e time of the day at which energy is consumed)? To do so, we compared the energy consumption measured in a 40-dwelling social housing building located in Quebec City (Canada) during four months of lockdown to those of the months that preceded the lockdown It is found that consumption patterns for electricity and hot water changed for the first two months of the lockdown, when the most intensive lockdown measures were applied Overall consumption slightly increased for these two energy expenditures, but the more important change was that consumption occurred throughout the day instead of being concentrated in the evening as observed before the lockdown Results shed light on the impact of lockdown on energy bills for consumers and on how energy utilities might be solicited during this kind of episode","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on energy consumption in a Canadian social housing building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-immersion virtual reality (VR) technology is often associated with gaming.

The survey explored the relationships between the teachers VR integration level and their instructional approaches, as well as the frequency of VR use. Furthermore, the survey yielded answers on the relationship between the availability of information technology (IT) personnel and the frequency of VR use. Overall, teachers had moderately positive perceptions of the use of VR in education. There was no strong correlation between instructional approaches and the level of VR integration, but lower levels of VR integration were associated with more traditional teaching approaches. The results revealed a positive correlation between the level of VR integration and the frequency of VR use.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS This retrospective cohort study includes deidentified data from 2229 UK patients from the INSIGHT Health Data Research digital hub. We forecasted the number of treatment-na?ve nAMD patients requiring anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) initiation during UK lockdown (16 March 2020 through 31 July 2020) at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) and University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB). Best-measured visual acuity (VA) changes without anti-VEGF therapy were predicted using post hoc analysis of Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD trial sham-control arm data (n=238). RESULTS At our centres, 376 patients were predicted to require anti-VEGF initiation during lockdown (MEH: 325; UHB: 51). Without treatment, mean VA was projected to decline after 12 months. The proportion of eyes in the MEH cohort predicted to maintain the key positive visual outcome of 70 ETDRS letters (Snellen equivalent 6/12) fell from 25.5% at baseline to 5.8% at 12 months (UHB: 9.8%-7.8%). Similarly, eyes with VA <25 ETDRS letters (6/96) were predicted to increase from 4.3% to 14.2% at MEH (UHB: 5.9%-7.8%) after 12 months without treatment. CONCLUSIONS Here, we demonstrate how combining data from a recently founded national digital health data repository with historical industry-funded clinical trial data can enhance predictive modelling in nAMD. The demonstrated detrimental effects of prolonged treatment delay should incentivise healthcare providers to support nAMD patients accessing care in safe environments.

Although Black/African American women and Hispanic/Latina women have lower circulating vitamin D levels than non-Hispanic White women, few studies have examined the association between vitamin D and breast cancer within these racial/ethnic groups. METHODS: The vitamin D-breast cancer association was evaluated using a case-cohort sample of self-identified Black/African American and non-Black Hispanic/Latina women participating in the US-wide Sister Study cohort. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D) were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in blood samples collected at the baseline from 415 women (290 Black/African American women and 125 non-Black Hispanic/Latina women) who developed breast cancer. These were compared to concentrations in 1545 women (1084 Black/African American women and 461 Hispanic/Latina women) randomly selected from the cohort. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, women with circulating 25(OH)D concentrations above the clinical cut point for deficiency (20.0 ng/mL) had lower breast cancer rates than women with concentrations  20 ng/mL (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). The inverse association was strongest among Hispanic/Latina women (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93), with a weaker association observed among Black/African American women (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.68-1.18; P for heterogeneity = 0.13). There were no clear differences by menopausal status, follow-up time, estrogen receptor status, or invasiveness. Neither 24,25(OH)2 D nor the 24,25(OH)2 D to 25(OH)D ratio were independently associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study supports the hypothesis that vitamin D may be protective against breast cancer incidence in women, including non-Black Hispanic/Latina and Black/African American women.; LAY SUMMARY: Vitamin D may protect against breast cancer. Although women of color have lower average vitamin D levels than non-Hispanic White women, few studies have considered the role of race/ethnicity. In a sample of self-identified Black/African American and Hispanic/Latina women, we observed that vitamin D concentrations measured in blood were inversely associated with breast cancer, particularly among Latinas. These findings indicate that vitamin D may protect women against breast cancer, including those in racial/ethnic groups with low average circulating levels.","output":"Vitamin D concentrations and breast cancer incidence among Black/African American and non-Black Hispanic/Latina women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 490 years (IQR 410C580). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50C130]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

We aimed to determine the clinical findings, phenotype-genotype correlation, and treatment outcomes within a large pediatric FMF cohort. The medical charts of children with FMF who were diagnosed and followed up at the eight pediatric rheumatology units were reviewed retrospectively. All patients in the cohort were analyzed for sequence variants in exon 2,3,5 and 10 of the MEFV gene. Patients without any mutations or with polymorphisms including R202Q were excluded. A total of 3,454 children were involved in the study. The mean  standard deviation of current age, age at symptom onset, and age at diagnosis were 12.1  5.2, 5.1  3.8, and 7.3  4.0 years, respectively. Of 3,454 patients, 88.2% had abdominal pain, 86.7% had fever, 27.7% had arthritis, 20.2% had chest pain, 23% had myalgia, and 13.1% had erysipelas-like erythema. The most common MEFV mutation patterns were homozygous (32.5%) and heterozygous (29.9%) mutations of exon 10. Homozygous M694V was present in 969 patients (28.1%). Allele frequencies of common mutations were M694V (55.3%), M680I (11.3%), V726A (7.6%), and E148Q (7.2%). Children carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous exon 10 mutations had an earlier age of disease onset (4.6 vs. 5.6 years, p = 0.000) and a higher number of attacks per year (11.1 vs. 9.6, p = 0.001). Although 8% of the patients had a family history of amyloidosis, 0.3% (n = 11) had the presence of amyloidosis. M694V homozygosity was detected in nine patients who developed amyloidosis. Colchicine resistance was present in 4.2% of our patients. In this largest pediatric cohort reviewed and presented to date, patients with exon 10 mutations, particularly the M694V homozygous mutation, have been demonstrated earlier disease onset, annual attack count, and more frequent colchicine-resistant cases. Although E148Q is considered as a polymorphism in some populations, it was identified as a disease-causing mutation in our cohort. Secondary amyloidosis is still happening in adults however, it is extremely rare among children, presumably due to increased awareness, tight control, and the availability of anti-IL1 agents in colchicine-resistant cases.","output":"Real-Life Data From the Largest Pediatric Familial Mediterranean Fever Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Characterization of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections are limited.

RECENT FINDINGS Molecular epidemiology is not yet in widespread use, but shows promise toward informing on-the-ground decision-making during outbreaks. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have been achieved for each of these threats; however, deployment of Zika and Ebola diagnostics lags behind those for COVID-19. POC metagenomics offers the possibility of identifying novel viruses. Vaccines have been successfully approved for Ebola and COVID-19, due in large part to public-private partnerships and advance purchase commitments.

This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and super-spreaders. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that super-spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant.

In order to safely care for patients new processes, such as a plan for the airway management of a patient with COVID-19, must be implemented and disseminated in a rapid fashion. The use of in-situ simulation has been used to assist in latent problem identification as part of a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Additionally, simulation is an effective means for training teams to perform high-risk procedures before engaging in the actual procedure. This educational advance seeks to use and study in-situ simulation as a means to rapidly implement a process for airway management in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using an airway algorithm developed by the authors, we designed an in-situ simulation scenario to train physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists in best practices for airway management of patients with COVID-19. Physician participants were surveyed using a five-point Likert scale with regard to their comfort level with various aspects of the airway algorithm both before and after the simulation in a retrospective fashion. Additionally, we obtained feedback from all participants and used it to refine the airway algorithm. RESULTS: Over a two-week period, 93 physicians participated in the simulation. We received 81 responses to the survey (87%), which showed that the average level of comfort with personal protective equipment procedures increased significantly from 2.94 (95% confidence interval, 2.71C3.17) to 4.36 (4.24C4.48), a difference of 1.42 (1.20C1.63, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in average comfort level in understanding the physician role with scores increasing from 3.51 (3.26C3.77) to 4.55 (2.71C3.17), a difference of 1.04 (0.82C1.25, p < 0.001). There was also increased comfort in performing procedural tasks such as intubation, from 3.08 (2.80C3.35) to 4.38 (4.23C4.52) after the simulation, a difference of 1.30 points (1.06C1.54, p < 0.001). Feedback from the participants also led to refinement of the airway algorithm. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented a new airway management guideline for patients with suspected COVID-19.

Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) lung scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice for the screening of CTEPH. However, there is no consensus on the criteria to use for interpretation. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of various interpretation criteria of planar V/Q scintigraphy for the screening of CTEPH in patients with PH. METHODS: The eligible study population consisted of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PH in the Brest University Hospital, France. Final diagnosis (CTEPH or non-CTEPH) was established in a referential center on the management of PH, based on the ESC/ERS guidelines and a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A retrospective central review of planar V/Q scintigraphy was performed by three nuclear physicians blinded to clinical findings and to final diagnosis. The number, extent (sub-segmental or segmental) and type (matched or mismatched) of perfusion defects were reported. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for various criteria based on the number of mismatched perfusion defects and the number of perfusion defects (regardless of ventilation). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for both. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients with newly diagnosed PH were analyzed. Fifty six (24.8%) were diagnosed with CTEPH while 170 patients (75.2%) were diagnosed with non-CTEPH. The optimal threshold was 2.5 segmental mismatched perfusion defects, providing a sensitivity of 100 % (95% CI 93.6C100%) and a specificity of 94.7% (95%CI 90.3C97.2%). Lower diagnostic cut-offs of mismatched perfusion defects provided similar sensitivity but lower specificity. Ninety five percent of patients with CTEPH had more than 4 segmental mismatched defects. An interpretation only based on perfusion provided similar sensitivity but a specificity of 81.8% (95%CI 75.3C86.9%). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the high diagnostic performance of planar V/Q scintigraphy for the screening of CTEPH in patients with PH. The optimal diagnostic cut-off for interpretation was 2.5 segmental mismatched perfusion defects. An interpretation only based on perfusion defects provided similar sensitivity but lower specificity.","output":"Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Scintigraphy for the Screening of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH): Which Criteria to Use?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 led to the declaration of the state of sanitary alarm between March and June 2020 in Spain.

Method and objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the state of alarm decreed from March 14 to June 22, 2020 on the breastmilk bank at Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain, in comparison with the same period during the previous year. To that end, a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken in which the activity indicators of the breastmilk bank were collected and compared to data from the milk bank at Hospital Virgen de las Nieves and peripheral collaborating centers. RESULTS during the first state of alarm in 2020 a global reduction was seen in new donor registrations, number of donors who donated milk, donated mean volume per mother, and total volume of received and pasteurized milk. However, new registrations and number of donors who donated milk during this period increased in Granada's breastmilk bank.

We presented a novel and non-invasive approach to improving immunity by targeting the splenic CECs via sonoporation generated by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD). The systematic immunity enhanced by the reduction of PDL-1-expressing CECs also benefits the PDL-1 blockade therapy. In the Lewis lung cancer (LLC) model, the study group was treated by UTMD for 10 min at the splenic area with or without anti-mouse PDL-1 intraperitoneal injection. The frequency of splenic CEC, lymphocyte, and cytokine production was analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) was tested by ELISA. Tumor volume was evaluated by two-dimensional ultrasound. The UTMD treatment consisted of ultrasound sonication and Sonazoid? microbubble injection through the caudal vein. The mechanic index (MI) of ultrasound was set between 0.98 and 1.03. The results showed a significant reduction of splenic CECs and increased frequency of CD8(+) T cells treated by UTMD treatment in the late-stage tumor. Tumor growth could be inhibited by UTMD combined with PDL-1 blockade therapy. The frequencies of interferon- (IFN-) producing CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were significantly increased after being treated by the combination of UTMD and PDL-1 blockade, while the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the fraction of the TGF--producing CD11b(+) cells were significantly decreased. These preliminary findings suggest that UTMD enhances immune response and facilitates PDL-1 blockade therapy by targeting immunosuppressive CECs in the spleen.

In 2020, mortality due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exceeded annual rates of death from TB. The impact of active COVID-19 and TB co-infection remain unclear. We present one of the first documented cases of active TB in the setting of COVID-19 infection in the United States. Case Report A 49-year-old man with a past medical history of mediastinal gray zone lymphoma and hypertension presented to the emergency room with a four-day history of diarrhea and hematochezia. The patient immigrated from Vietnam in 1995. Computed tomography imaging revealed thickening of the sigmoid wall, and bilateral pulmonary ground glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was also neutropenic from recent chemotherapy. On admission, he began experiencing worsening hypoxia with exertion, and was started on remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 infection. Serial chest radiographs revealed worsening bibasilar opacities. He continued to have higher oxygen requirements and maxed out on high-flow nasal cannula and non-rebreather with 88-90% oxygen saturation, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit. A complete infectious workup was performed at this point. Cytomegalovirus PCR was positive at 1486IU and was started on ganciclovir. A bronchoscopy was performed but all testing was negative, including that for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. The patient continued to become increasingly hypoxic, acidotic, and septic, and eventually underwent tracheostomy. Twenty days post-bronchoscopy, cultures from the bronchoalveolar fluid came back positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). A new sputum sample was sent and was found to be smear positive (2+ AFB) and MTB PCR positive. The patient was initiated on rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol therapy. Unfortunately, the patient continued to decompensate and was unable to be weaned off the ventilator. Comfort care was initiated by the family and the patient passed away on hospital day 68. Discussion The patient had several risk factors for latent TB reactivation, including malignancy, long-term corticosteroid use, and COVID-19 infection. Early research has shown that risk of death and recovery time with COVID-19 may be higher in patients with previous or active TB compared to those without. In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and multiple risk factors for immunosuppression, latent TB reactivation should be considered in addition to secondary superinfection.","output":"A Rare Case of Latent Tuberculosis Reactivation in the Setting of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 developed global-pandemic with millions of infections/deaths.

Further, competitive-docking/binding-analyses were done by PRODIGY. Present results suggest that compared to the wild-spike, CUT4 showed extra LYS31-PHE490/GLN42-GLN498 bonding and lack of TYR41-THR500 interaction (in wild H-bond:2.639?) with ACE2 RBD.

In 2DEGs closer to the surface, unbiased illuminations result in a mobility loss, driven by an increase in surface charge density. Biased illuminations performed with positive applied gate voltages result in a mobility gain, whereas those performed with negative applied voltages result in a mobility loss.

This precipitous shift presented medical educators with a challenge, to create a simulacrum of the learning environment that students experience in classroom, in DL. Aim We define a DL framework that provides a simulacrum of classroom experience and can be effectively employed for course delivery in a competency-based curriculum during unprecedented times. Methodology The frameworks blueprint was designed amalgamating principles of: Garrisons community inquiry, Siemens connectivism and Harasims online collaborative-learning;and improved using Andersons DL-model. Effectiveness of the designed framework in course delivery was demonstrated using the exemplar of fundamentals in epidemiology and biostatistics (FEB) course in our curriculum during COVID-19 lockdown. Virtual live-sessions integrated in the framework employed a blended-approach informed by instructional-design strategies of Gagne and Peyton. The efficiency of the framework was evaluated using first two levels of Kirkpatricks framework i.e. perception and cognitive development. Results Of 60 students, 51 (85%) responded to the survey assessing perception towards DL (Kirkpatricks Level:1). The survey-items, validated using exploratory factor analysis, were classified into four categories: computer expertise;DL flexibility;DL usefulness;and DL satisfaction. The overall mean (SD) score of 62.0 (9.0) for the four categories, highlighted respondents overall satisfaction with the framework. Scores for specific survey-items attested that students had an enriched learning experience, which promoted collaborative-learning and student-autonomy. For, Kirkpatricks Level:2 i.e. cognitive-development, performance in FEBs summative-assessment of students experiencing DL was compared with students taught using traditional methods. Similar, mean-scores for both groups indicated that shift to DL didnt have an adverse effect on students learning. Conclusion QED, we have demonstrated that the framework is an efficient pedagogical approach, pertinent for medical schools to adopt (elaborated using Bourdieus Theory of Practice) to address students learning trajectories during unprecedented times.","output":"Creating a simulacrum of in-class learning environment employing distance learning modality during the COVID-19 pandemia: Quod Erat Demonstrandum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We combine data collected just prior to the unfolding of COVID-19 with follow-up data from July 2020 to document the adverse economic effects of the pandemic and resulting impact on parental and child mental well-being in rural and semi-urban Pakistan. 22% of the households in our sample are affected by job loss, with monthly income down 34% on average.

The study aimed to investigate the role of soluble (s)CD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels in predicting disease severity and characterize peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects). METHODS: On admission, in COVID-19 subjects sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, and peripheral blood monocyte and DC subsets were compared to healthy donors (HDs). According to clinical outcome, COVID-19 subjects were divided into ARDS and non-ARDS groups. RESULTS: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher sCD163 (p<0.0001) and sCD14 (p<0.0001) plasmatic levels. We observed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels in the ARDS group compared to the non-ARDS one (p=0.002). The cut-off for sCD163 plasmatic level greater than 2032 ng/ml was predictive of disease severity (AUC: 0.6786, p=0.0022; sensitivity 56.7% [CI: 44.1C68.4] specificity 73.8% [CI: 58.9C84.7]). Positive correlation between plasmatic levels of sCD163, LDH and IL-6 and between plasmatic levels of sCD14, D-dimer and ferritin were found. Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed lower percentages of non-classical (p=0.0012) and intermediate monocytes (p=0.0447), slanDCs (p<0.0001), myeloid DCs (mDCs, p<0.0001), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, p=0.0014). Compared to the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group showed lower percentages of non-classical monocytes (p=0.0006), mDCs (p=0.0346), and pDCs (p=0.0492). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, observed on hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects, especially in those who developed ARDS, and the correlations of these monocyte/macrophage activation markers with typical inflammatory markers of COVID-19 pneumonia, underline their potential use to assess the risk of progression of the disease. In an early stage of the disease, the assessment of sCD163 plasmatic levels could have clinical utility in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Increased sCD163 and sCD14 Plasmatic Levels and Depletion of Peripheral Blood Pro-Inflammatory Monocytes, Myeloid and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new year symbolizes new hope for the future, especially this year as we start to see the first wave of vaccines administered against COVID-19.

Some recent tools automatically offer program repair feedback by identifying any differences between incorrect and correct programs, but suffer from issues related to scalability, accuracy, and cross-language portability. This paper presents FAPR -- our novel approach that suggests repairs based on program differences in a fast and accurate manner. FAPR is different from current tools in three aspects. First, it encodes syntactic information into token sequences to enable high-speed comparison between incorrect and correct programs. Second, to accurately extract program differences, FAPR adopts a novel matching algorithm that maximizes token-level matches and minimizes statement-level differences. Third, FAPR relies on testing instead of static/dynamic analysis to validate and refine candidate repairs, so it eliminates the language dependency or high runtime overhead incurred by complex program analysis. We implemented FAPR to suggest repairs for both C and C++ programs; our experience shows the great cross-language portability of FAPR. More importantly, we empirically compared FAPR with a state-of-the-art tool Clara. FAPR suggested repairs for over 95.5% of incorrect solutions. We sampled 250 repairs among FAPR's suggestions, and found 89.6% of the samples to be minimal and correct. FAPR outperformed Clara by suggesting repairs for more cases, creating smaller repairs, producing higher-quality fixes, and causing lower runtime overheads.

Previously, it has been reported that the plasma concentrations of lopinavir significantly increase in inflammatory settings. As COVID-19 may be associated with major inflammation, assessing the plasma concentrations and safety of lopinavir in COVID-19 patients is essential. METHODS: Real-world COVID-19 data based on a retrospective study. RESULTS: Among the 31 COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir between March 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020, it was observed higher lopinavir plasma concentrations, which increased by 4.6-fold (interquartile range: 3.6-6.2), as compared to the average plasma concentrations in HIV. Lopinavir concentrations in all except one patient were above the upper limit of the concentration range of HIV treatment. Approximately one to five patients prematurely stopped treatment mainly due to an ADR related to hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders. CONCLUSION: Lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 were higher than expected, and they were associated with the occurrence of hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. However, a high plasma concentration may be required for in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by previous studies. Therefore, in the absence of adverse drug reaction, lopinavir dosage should not be reduced.

A series of investigations which analyzed pathogen transmission in different environments (hospital, teaching building, etc) demonstrated the effect of airflow on pathogen transmission and emphasized the importance of reasonable ventilation. Finally, this review presented three advanced methods: LBM method, Porous Media method, and Web-based forecasting method. Although CFD methods mentioned in this review may not alleviate the current pandemic situation, it helps researchers realize the transmission mechanisms of pathogens like viruses and bacteria and provides guidelines for reducing infection risk in epidemic or pandemic situations.","output":"The role of computational fluid dynamics tools on investigation of pathogen transmission: Prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 which causes COVID-19 disease results in severe morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable groups. Pregnancy by virtue of its physiological and anatomical adaptations increases the risk of severe infections especially those of the respiratory tract. This single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by droplets as well as soiled fomites. There are various degrees of disease severity- asymptomatic, mild, moderate severe and critical. Most infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. For these women, the consequences on the mother or pregnancy are minimal unless they have additional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity or are of ethnic minority background. Most women with symptoms will present with fever, unproductive cough, sore throat, myalgia, nasal congestion, loss of smell and taste with associated leukocytosis and lymphopenia. Diagnosis is by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal flocked swabs or saliva and pathognomonic features of ground-glass appearance and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scans. Management in pregnancy is same as that for non-pregnant women with COVID-19. It is not an indication for elective delivery but assisted delivery in the second stage for those with moderate, severe or critical disease may be required to shorten this stage. COVID-19 is not an indication for interrupting pregnancy or caesarean section but the latter may be performed to facilitate ventilation support or resuscitation in those with severe disease. Pain relief in labour should not be different but regional analgesia is preferred for operative deliveries. Postpartum thromboprophylaxis should be considered and breast feeding encouraged with appropriate precautions to minimize vertical transmission. Pregnant and lactating women should be encouraged to receive the mRNA based vaccines as there is no evidence of adverse outcomes with these.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy - An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteases, i. e. the main protease (M(pro)) and the papain\\\\like protease (PL(pro)), which hydrolyze the viral polypeptide chain giving functional non\\\\structural proteins, are essential for viral replication and are medicinal chemistry targets.

The aim of this review is to provide a clinical approach of SARS-CoV-2 neurological complications based on the direct or indirect (systemic/immune-mediated) role of the SARS-CoV-2 in their genesis. METHODS: A review of the current literature has been carried out up to May 20th 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines. All case series and reports of adult neurological manifestations associated to SARS-CoV-2 published in English were considered. Review and fundamental research studies on Coronaviruses neuroinvasive potential were analyzed to support pathogenic hypothesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Clinical patterns were subdivided into three groups according to putative underlying mechanisms: direct invasion of central or peripheral nervous system, systemic disorders leading to acute CNS injuries and post-infectious neurological syndromes (PINS). RESULTS: Sixteen case series and 26 case reports for a total of 903 patients were identified presenting with neurological involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypo/anosmia and dys/ageusia were found in 826 patients and mainly attributed to direct viral invasion. Cerebrovascular complications occurred in 51 patients and related to viral infection associated systemic inflammation. PINS were described in only 26 patients. A wide heterogeneity of these reports emerged concerning the extension of the clinical examination and ancillary exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly related to olfactory and gustatory sensory perception disorders through possible direct nervous system invasion while cerebrovascular disease and PINS are rare and due to distinct and indirect pathophysiological mechanisms.","output":"Neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A clinical systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli, a commensal in the intestines of vertebrates, is capable of colonizing many different hosts and the environment. Commensal E. coli strains are believed to be the precursor of pathogenic strains by means of acquisition of antimicrobial resistant and virulence genes. Laboratory rodents are inherently susceptible to numerous known infectious agents, which could transfer virulence determinants to commensal E. coli. Hence, in this study, the genetic structure of commensal E. coli found in laboratory rodents and their antimicrobial resistance profiles were investigated. RESULTS: E. coli strains belonging to phylogroup A were the predominant strain obtained from the animals used in the study. Four novel sequence types (ST746, ST747, ST748 and ST749) were discovered using the multi locus sequence typing, together with one common ST357 in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and, the trachea and lung. Serotyping demonstrated that these commensal E. coli strains were non-Shiga toxin-producers. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of extended spectrum beta lactamases were also negative. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implied that the E. coli strains recovered from the laboratory rodents were truly commensal in nature. Further study is required to investigate the possible influence of gender on the susceptibility of hosts to E. coli colonization in laboratory rodents.

This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor.

The CDC recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 children (the majority < 5 years of age) were referred, to our Pediatric Department, as possible cases of COVID-19 infection. Blood analysis, chest X-ray, and naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens for viral identification of COVID-19 were requested. RESULTS: None of the screened children resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%). An high C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively.

Adenoviral vector-based vaccines can bind platelets and induce their destruction in the reticuloendothelial organs. Liposomal mRNA-based vaccines may instead favour activation of coagulation factors and confer a pro-thrombotic phenotype to endothelial cells and platelets. Furthermore, both formulations may trigger a type I interferon response associated with the generation of aPLs. In turn, aPLs may lead to aberrant activation of the immune response with participation of innate immune cells, cytokines and the complement cascade.

Recommended outcomes included exercise tolerance, respiratory function, muscle strength, and activities of daily living (ADL) or functional independence. Recommended treatments included respiratory rehabilitation, exercise therapy, education, psychological support, ADL and gait training, traditional Chinese medicine, and cognitive and vocational rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: There were incongruities between what is known about postacute COVID-19 and what was recommended in the literature. Given the relatively large proportion of survivors who experience ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or postCCOVID-19 syndrome, it is important to quickly develop tools for self-management and access to rehabilitation specialists in multidisciplinary teams. IMPACT: Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and respiratory therapists have an important role to play. Clinicians should focus on epidemiological evidence and emerging information on late sequelae of COVID-19 to inform rehabilitation programming and future research.","output":"Apparent Discordance between the Epidemiology of COVID-19 and Recommended Outcomes and Treatments: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the most talked topic in social media platforms in 2020.

We choose the social media platform Twitter for our analysis and study the Tweets to discover the sentimental perspective, emotional perspective, and triggering words towards the reopening. During this COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have made some analysis on various social media dataset regarding lockdown and stay at home. However, in our analysis, we are particularly interested to analyse public sentiment on reopening. Our major finding is that when all states resorted to lockdown in March, people showed dominant emotion of fear, but as reopening starts people have less fear. While this may be true, due to this reopening phase daily positive cases are rising compared to the lockdown situation.

With the development of high-resolution sequencing, the N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification has been proved to be affected by genetic variation. In this study, we identified the T2D-associated m6A-SNPs from T2D GWAS data and explored the underlying mechanism of the pathogenesis of T2D. Methods: We examined the association of m6A-SNPs with T2D among large-scale T2D GWAS summary statistics and further performed multi-omics integrated analysis to explore the potential role of the identified m6A-SNPs in T2D pathogenesis. Results: Among the 15,124 T2D-associated m6A-SNPs, 71 of them reach the genome-wide significant threshold (5.0e-05). The leading SNP rs4993986 (C>G), which is located near the m6A modification site at the 3' end of the HLA-DQB1 transcript, is expected to participate in the pathogenesis of T2D by influencing m6A modification to regulate the HLA-DQB1 expression. Conclusion: The current study has suggested a potential correlation between m6A-SNPs and T2D pathogenesis and also provided new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of the T2D susceptibility loci identified by GWAS.","output":"Exploring the Epigenetic Regulatory Role of m6A-Associated SNPs in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cell line (BHFTE) was derived from a tongue explant of a bighorn sheep fetus (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). The cells have been maintained through 23 serial passages, and the modal number of chromosomes was calculated to be 55. Monolayer cultures were shown to be susceptible to various viruses, including bluetongue virus (BTV). Of 5 BTV serotypes (2, 10, 11, 13, and 17) tested, each produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) on initial passage at 33 C. A field isolate (serotype 10) of BTV from a black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in its second passage in Vero-M cells also produced CPE when inoculated into BHFTE cells. Antigens of BTV were demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of BHFTE cells inoculated with homogenates of chicken embryos injected with clinical specimens from a domestic sheep and an Arabian oryx (Oryx gazella leucoryx). A suspension of BTV-infected gnats (Culicoides spp.) produced CPE and BTV-specific fluorescence on the first passage in cells inoculated with a suspension of blood from sheep experimentally infected with BTV. Additionally, selected bovine viruses induced CPE in the cells. The cell line, which is free of mycoplasma and bovine viral diarrhea virus contamination, may be useful in diagnostic medicine and research involving the ruminant species.","output":"Susceptibility of a fetal tongue cell line derived from bighorn sheep to five serotypes of bluetongue virus and its potential for the isolation of viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery from plants usually focuses on small molecules rather than such biological macromolecules as RNAs.

A dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that tRF-T11 directly targets the 3 UTR of oncogene TRPA1 mRNA. Furthermore, an Argonaute-RNA immunoprecipitation (AGO-RIP) assay demonstrated that tRF-T11 can interact with AGO2 to suppress TRPA1 via an RNAi pathway. This study uncovers a new role of plant-derived tRFs in regulating endogenous genes.

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study including all consecutive adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the first nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (day 0), additional samples were obtained on days + 3, + 5, + 7 and then once every 7 days until virus detection was negative. PVS was defined as the duration of shedding of at least 21 days after diagnosis. The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of PVS. RESULTS: Data were obtained regarding 121 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age 66 years, male sex 65.3%). Overall, the prevalence of PVS was 38% (46/121 patients). According to univariate analysis, factors associated with PVS were immunosuppression (6.7% vs 21.7%, p = 0.02), increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (&#8805; 35 ng/ml) at the time of diagnosis (43.4% vs 67.3%, p = 0.02), time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis (median days 7.0 vs 3.5, p = 0.001), intensive care unit admission (22.7% vs 43.5%, p = 0.02), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (20.0% vs 41.3%, p = 0.01). The multivariate analysis indicated that immunosuppression, increased IL-6 levels at the time of diagnosis, time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and need for mechanical ventilation were independent factors associated with PVS. CONCLUSIONS: PVS was detected in up to 38% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and was strongly associated with immunosuppression, increased IL-6 levels, and the need for mechanical ventilation.","output":"Prevalence and Clinical Significance of Persistent Viral Shedding in Hospitalized Adult Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Assessing outcomes after pediatric critical illness is imperative to evaluate practice and improve recovery of patients and their families. We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify domains and instruments previously used to evaluate these outcomes. DESIGN Scoping review. SETTING We queried PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Registry for studies evaluating pediatric critical care survivors or their families published between 1970 and 2017. We identified articles using key words related to pediatric critical illness and outcome domains. We excluded articles if the majority of patients were greater than 18 years old or less than 1 month old, mortality was the sole outcome, or only instrument psychometrics or procedural outcomes were reported. We used dual review for article selection and data extraction and categorized outcomes by domain (overall health, emotional, physical, cognitive, health-related quality of life, social, family). SUBJECTS Manuscripts evaluating outcomes after pediatric critical illness. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 60,349 citations, 407 articles met inclusion criteria; 87% were published after 2000. Study designs included observational (85%), interventional (7%), qualitative (5%), and mixed methods (3%). Populations most frequently evaluated were traumatic brain injury (n = 96), general pediatric critical illness (n = 87), and congenital heart disease (n = 72). Family members were evaluated in 74 studies (18%). Studies used a median of 2 instruments (interquartile range 1-4 instruments) and evaluated a median of 2 domains (interquartile range 2-3 domains). Social (n = 223), cognitive (n = 183), and overall health (n = 161) domains were most frequently studied. Across studies, 366 unique instruments were used, most frequently the Wechsler and Glasgow Outcome Scales. Individual domains were evaluated using a median of 77 instruments (interquartile range 39-87 instruments).

Renal cell cancer (RCC) patients configure a heterogenous populations: some of them present indolent cases which can safely have postponed their treatments, others present aggressive tumors, deserving immediate care. These scenarios must be properly identified before a tailored therapeutic choice. Objectives We propose a risk- based approach for patients with RCC, to be used during this unprecedented viral infection time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a literature review focused in COVID-19 and current RCC treatments, we suggest therapeutic strategies of RCC in two sections: surgical approach and systemic therapy, in all stages of this malignance. RESULTS: Patients with cT1a tumors (and complex cysts, Bosniak III/IV), must be put under active surveillance and delayed intervention. cT1b-T2a/b cases must be managed by partial or radical nephrectomy, some selected T1b-T2a ((&#8804;7cm) cases can have the surgery postponed by 60-90 days). Locally advanced tumors (&#8805;cT3 and or N+) must be promptly resected. As possible, minimally invasive surgery and early hospital discharge are encouraged. Upfront cytoreduction, is not recommendable for low risk oligometastatic patients, which must start systemic treatment or even could be put under surveillance and delayed therapy. Intermediate and poor risk metastatic patients must start target therapy and/or immunotherapy (few good responders intermediate cases can have postponed cytoreduction). The recommendation about hereditary RCC syndromes are lacking, thus we recommend its usual care. Local or loco regional recurrence must have individualized approaches. For all cases, we suggest the application of a specific informed consent and a shared therapeutic choice. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic COVID -19 times, a tailored risk-based approach must be used for a safe management of RCC, aiming to not compromise the oncological outcomes of the patients.","output":"Consideration in the management of renal cell carcinoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"abstract: Newly emergent infectious diseases are a global public health problem.

Unilateral diaphragm paralysis has been associated with proximal brachial plexus blockade, such as interscalene and supraclavicular block. The impact of UDP in patients with SDB is not known in this context. The objectives of this scoping review were to explore the associations between UDP and worsening SDB severity, oxygenation, and pulmonary function. METHODS A systematic search was developed, peer-reviewed, and applied to Embase, Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases to include studies involving adult patients ( 18 yr) with SDB, where the effects of UDP on SDB severity, oxygenation, and pulmonary function were examined. RESULTS Six studies (n = 100 patients) with UDP and SDB were included. The sample population was derived exclusively from respirology-sleep clinics, and none were surgical patients. Compared with control (no UDP), UDP was associated with an increased respiratory disturbance index, most pronounced during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and supine sleep. Supine and REM sleep were associated with obstructive and mixed (both obstructive and central) events, respectively. Compared with control, UDP was associated with a lower mean and minimum oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen tension during all sleep stages and in all body positions. The majority of UDP patients were found to have clinically significant reductions in mean forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity values, consistent with restrictive ventilatory pattern. CONCLUSION We observed an association between UDP and increasing SDB severity, particularly during REM sleep and while sleeping in the supine position.

Death from SARS is most often due to rapidly progressive respiratory compromise (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. However, the mechanisms evoking respiratory distress and a fulminant systemic response remain unclear. In order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS, we analyzed clinical manifestations and levels of serum cytokines of SARS patients. METHODS Fourteen hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection at National Taiwan University Hospital from March to May 2003 were included. Data on clinical manifestations, parameters of laboratory tests, complications and final outcomes of patients were collected retrospectively. Serial plasma inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of preserved serum were measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS All 14 patients had fever, dry cough and dyspnea. Twelve were intubated during hospitalization. The median duration from onset of fever to the nadir level or most severe condition was 9 days for hypoxia, 7 days for lymphocytopenia, 6.5 days for thrombocytopenia, 9.5 days for maximal pulmonary infiltrates; to peak serum levels was 9 days for C-reactive protein (CRP), 10.5 days for IL-6, 13.5 days for IL-8 and 12 days for TNF-alpha; to defervescence was 13 days. There was no significant elevation of serum IL-1beta levels in any of the 14 patients. There were no significant differences in peak levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha between patients with and without ARDS. The 8 patients who died tended to have higher peak levels of serum TNF-alpha compared to those who survived (14 vs 9.1 pg/mL; p = 0.06). CONCLUSION Rapid elevation of inflammatory cytokines-IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha might play a role in the development of SARS-related ARDS. The timing of elevations in inflammatory cytokines and CRP is correlated with progression of pulmonary infiltrates of SARS patients. The peak level of serum TNF-alpha tends to be higher in patients who die of SARS than in those who survive. Our results indicate that CRP and TNF-alpha might be used as prognostic markers of SARS.","output":"Clinical manifestations and inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global, public health concern that affects humans, animals and the environment.

Subsequently, we developed an instruction folder highlighting the most important aspects of PM risk and mitigation, and tested this folder in a digital experiment. The digital experiment yielded positive results with regards to acquired knowledge about PM, but did not on risk perception or safety behavior. METHODS: In this study, we investigate the effects of the folder when combined with a practical assignment involving a PM exposimeter, showing the amount of particulate matter in microgram per cubic meter in real time on its display for various activities. We tested this at six workplaces of four companies in the roadwork and construction branch. RESULTS: The results indicate that the folder itself yields an increased knowledge base in employees about PM, but the effects of the practical assignment are more contentious. Nevertheless, there is an indication that using the assignment may lead to a higher threat appraisal among employees for high exposure activities.

Many different extraction methods, library preparation protocols, and sequence and bioinformatic pipelines are available for virus sequence detection. To assess the performance of plant virology diagnostic laboratories in using the HTS of ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA (ribodepleted totRNA) as a diagnostic tool, we carried out an interlaboratory comparison study in which eight participants were required to use the same samples, (RNA) extraction kit, ribosomal RNA depletion kit, and commercial sequencing provider, but also their own bioinformatics pipeline, for analysis. The accuracy of virus detection ranged from 65% to 100%. The false-positive detection rate was very low and was related to the misinterpretation of results as well as to possible cross-contaminations in the lab or sequencing provider.

It contains a diverse range of soluble activators, membrane-bound receptors, and regulators. Its principal function is to eliminate pathogens via activation of three distinct pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin. In the case of viruses, the complement activation results in effector functions such as virion opsonisation by complement components, phagocytosis induction, virolysis by the membrane attack complex, and promotion of immune responses through anaphylatoxins and chemotactic factors. Recent studies have shown that the addition of individual complement components can neutralise viruses without requiring the activation of the complement cascade. While the complement-mediated effector functions can neutralise a diverse range of viruses, numerous viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert complement recognition/activation by encoding several proteins that inhibit the complement system, contributing to viral survival and pathogenesis. This review focuses on these complement-dependent and -independent interactions of complement components (especially C1q, C4b-binding protein, properdin, factor H, Mannose-binding lectin, and Ficolins) with several viruses and their consequences.","output":"Complement Proteins as Soluble Pattern Recognition Receptors for Pathogenic Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To avoid possible confusions to the readers, we provide further explanations for the eq.

First, we investigate how fundamental changes in the practice of burn surgery influenced the choice of topical therapies used. Then, we examine antimicrobial creams and ointments commonly recognized due to their long record of use in burn care. Next, we dive into antimicrobial solutions commonly used as adjuncts to surgical intervention. Finally, we explore representative antimicrobial dressings, an ever-advancing roster of products opening the door to the next era in burn care. We also describe how these new agents relate to already established tools in present-day burn care. EXPERT OPINION In the current day, though the wisdom of early excision and wound closure remains valid, we continue to strive to minimize aggressive wound excision and disfiguring donor tissue collection while securing rapid wound closure.

Then, joint lesions can only be observed and inferred from two-dimensional images, and it is difficult to perform accurate joint assessments, which is essential for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objectives: To develop the next-generation online telemedicine system utilizing mixed reality for RA. Methods: We have developed a system that can assess joints accurately in three-dimensions images in real-time, using Azure Kinect DK (depth sensor)/ HoloLens 2 (headset), which are mixed reality technologies, and Teams (online interview/chat) provided by Microsoft. Furthermore, by applying artificial intelligence (AI), we plan to implement additionally to this system 1) a function to quickly catch and automatically evaluate the patient's anxiety and changes in facial expressions at the time of examination, 2) a function to record dialogue with the patient in chronological order, 3) a function to support the detection of swollen joints, and 4) function to automatically analyze the questionnaire. Results: This system remotely connects a rheumatologist in the Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki City, urban area) and a patient with RA and a non-rheumatologist in the Goto Central Hospital (Goto Island, rural area).

Data from UK and elsewhere suggest high economic burden of CRS, but detailed cost information and economic analyses regarding surgical pathway are lacking. This paper estimates healthcare costs for patients receiving surgery for CRS in England. DESIGN Observational retrospective study examining cost of healthcare of patients receiving CRS surgery. SETTING Linked electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics databases in England. PARTICIPANTS A phenotyping algorithm using medical ontology terms identified 'definite' CRS cases who received CRS surgery. Patients were registered with a general practice in England. Data covered the period 1997-2016. A cohort of 13 462 patients had received surgery for CRS, with 9056 (67%) having confirmed nasal polyps. OUTCOME MEASURES Information was extracted on numbers and types of primary care prescriptions and consultations, and inpatient and outpatient hospital investigations and procedures. Resource use was costed using published sources. RESULTS Total National Health Service costs in CRS surgery patients were 2173 over 1 year including surgery. Total costs per person-quarter were 1983 in the quarter containing surgery, mostly comprising surgical inpatient care costs (1902), and around 60 per person-quarter in the 2 years before and after surgery, of which half were outpatient costs. Outpatient and primary care costs were low compared with the peak in inpatient costs at surgery. The highest outpatient expenditure was on CT scans, peaking in the quarter preceding surgery.

The disease originated in Africa has spread to Europe, Asia and Oceania, since 2007, reaching a pandemic dimension. Currently, the spread of ASF is unstoppable and that the development of a safe and effective vaccine is urgently required. The objective of this paper is to review the vaccine candidates tested during the 20th and 21st centuries, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these studies and to highlight what we should learn. Several strategies have been explored to date, some of which have shown positive and negative results. Inactivated preparations and subunit vaccines are not a viable option. The most promising strategy would appear to be live attenuated vaccines, because these vaccine candidates are able to induce variable percentages of protection against certain homologous and heterologous virus isolates. The number of studies on live attenuated vaccine candidates has steadily increased in the 21st century thanks to advances in molecular biology and an in-depth knowledge of ASF virus, which have allowed the development of vaccines based on deletion mutants. The deletion of virulence-related genes has proved to be a useful tool for attenuation, although attenuation does not always mean protection and even less, cross protection. Therefore, ASF vaccine development has proved to be one of the top priorities in ASF research. Efforts are still being made to fill the gaps in the knowledge regarding immune response, safety and cross protection, and these efforts will hopefully help to find a safe and effective vaccine that could be commercialised soon, thus making it possible to turn a dream into reality.","output":"African swine fever vaccine: Turning a dream into reality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Contact tracing is a key part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations to our knowledge have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country and provides data to support the expansion of contact tracing strategies with the aim of improving infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries.

Methods: This is a multi-centre retrospective observational study of IgG4-RD patients from France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Demographics, comorbidities, IgG4-RD features, current and past treatment along with COVID-19-suggestive symptoms and COVID-19 diagnoses from February 2020 to January 2021 were recorded by means of direct or phone interviews. Patients with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed (cCOVID) or presumed COVID-19 based on clinical, serological or imaging features (pCOVID) were pooled for analysis (totCOVID) and compared to patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Inter-group comparison of categorical and quantitative variables were performed by using the chi-square test with Fisher's correction and the Mann-Whitney's test respectively. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range) unless otherwise specified. Results: A total of 305 patients [71% males, median age 64 (54-74) years] were studied. Pancreato-biliary disease was the most frequently observed IgG4-RD phenotype (39%). Fifty-one percent of patients were taking corticosteroids at time of interview and 30% were on biological or conventional immunosuppressants. Thirty-two totCOVID cases (23 cCOVID, nine pCOVID) were identified: 11/32 were hospitalised, two needed intensive care and four (13%;3/4 aged 80 years) died. Having one or more infected family members was a risk factor for COVID-19 in patients with IgG4-RD (OR=19.9;p<0.001). No other demographic, clinical or treatment features associated with COVID-19. In particular there was no association between adverse outcomes with COVID-19 and higher doses of steroids (20mg) or rituximab administration. Conclusion: The prevalence and course of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients are similar to those of the general population of the same age, with no evident impact of disease-or treatment-related factors to the basal infectious risk.

Comparing the findings of the infections caused by these viruses would help reveal the novel characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight into the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs infection in adult hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study was performed at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital in the Republic of Korea, between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2020. A total of 109 consecutive patients who were over 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs were enrolled. Finally, 19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP were compared to 40 patients with endemic HCoV CAP. Flu-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, and prolonged fever were more common in SARS-CoV-2 CAP, whereas clinical findings suggestive of bacterial pneumonia such as dyspnea, leukocytosis with left shift, and increased C-reactive protein were more common in endemic HCoV CAP. Bilateral peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were typical radiologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 CAP, whereas mixed patterns of GGOs, consolidations, micronodules, and pleural effusion were observed in endemic HCoV CAP. Coinfection was not observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP, but was observed in more than half of the patients with endemic HCoV CAP. There were distinctive differences in the clinical and radiologic findings between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoV CAP. Further investigations are required to elucidate the mechanism underlying this difference. Follow-up observations are needed to determine if the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 CAP changes with repeated infection.","output":"Clinical and radiological findings of adult hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery (SILS) suggests a promising alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. In this report we describe our initial experience with SILS for both right hemicolectomies and anterior resections. METHODS Between June 2009 and May 2010, SILS was performed for 32 consecutive cases with benign and malignant pathology. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, postoperative data, and pathologic data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-one SILS right hemicolectomies, ten ARs, and one abdominal perineal resection (APR) were performed. For SILS right hemicolectomies, one case required full \\"conversion\\" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 85 min (range 45-150 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-10.0 cm). Median number of lymph nodes extracted in malignant cases was 17(range 10-30) and the overall median length of stay was 6 days (range 5-11). For left-sided lesions, ten cases of ARs (7 high ARs, 2 low ARs, 1 ultralow AR) and one APR were performed. Three cases were completed successfully via the SILS procedure, four cases required one additional port, and four cases required full \\"conversion\\" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 120 min (range 65-235 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-7.0 cm). Overall median length of stay was also 6 days (range 5-21). There was one case of anastomotic leak and one case of postoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, SILS for right hemicolectomies is safe and effective with reproducible oncologic results. SILS AR, however, requires greater modifications in current devices and techniques. SILS AR can be performed for both malignant and benign diseases but additional ports may be necessary for the safe completion of the procedure.","output":"Evaluation of current devices in single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a preliminary experience in 32 consecutive cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the dataset of undergraduates learning habits during and before the occurrence of pandemic COVID-19 under the scope of sociodemographic and psychological aspects.

In 2016, the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system launched a unique program to distribute video-enabled tablets to Veterans with access barriers. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the use of VA-issued video telehealth tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness in the VA system. DESIGN: Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we first evaluated the adoption of tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness and housed Veterans. We then analyzed health record and tablet utilization data to compare characteristics of both subpopulations, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with tablet use among Veterans experiencing homelessness. PATIENTS: In total, 12,148 VA patients receiving tablets between October 2017 and March 2019, focusing on the 1470 VA Veterans experiencing homelessness receiving tablets (12.1%). MAIN MEASURES: Tablet use within 6 months of receipt for mental health, primary or specialty care. KEY RESULTS: Nearly half (45.9%) of Veterans experiencing homelessness who received a tablet had a video visit within 6 months of receipt, most frequently for telemental health. Tablet use was more common among Veterans experiencing homelessness who were younger (AOR = 2.77; P <.001); middle-aged (AOR = 2.28; P <.001); in rural settings (AOR = 1.46; P =.005); and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.64; P <.001), and less common among those who were Black (AOR = 0.43; P <.001) and those with a substance use disorder (AOR = 0.59; P <.001) or persistent housing instability (AOR = 0.75; P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth care and connection for vulnerable populations are particularly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic but also beyond.

Generalized method of moments (GMM) and conventional increasing-smoothing asymptotic of GMM are applied to justify the study findings. Wald econometric technique is also used to robust the results. Findings: The study findings reported a consistent role of public support on energy efficiency financing indicators, during the COVID-19 crisis period. G7 countries raised funds around 17% through public supports for energy efficiency financing, and it raised 4% of per unit energy usage to GDP, accelerated 16% energy efficiency and 24% output of renewable energy sources, during COVID-19. By this, study findings warrant a maximum support from public offices, energy ministries and other allied departments for energy efficiency optimization. Practical implications: The study presents multiple policy implications to enhance energy efficiency through different alternative sources, such as, on-bill financing, direct energy efficiency grant, guaranteed financial contracts for energy efficiency and energy efficiency credit lines. If suggested policy recommendations are applied effectively, this holds the potential to diminish the influence of the COVID-19 crisis and can probably uplift the energy efficiency financing during structural crisis.

This qualitative study focuses on women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. METHOD: A purposive sample of fifteen women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV participated in the study. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: One theme was identified, stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength, and three categories are as follows: managing a restricted everyday life as an expert of their illness, being afraid of contracting infections leading to suffocation and suffering and importance of continuous help and support from significant others and digital media. Breathlessness restricted women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living with a body they have to wait for. Managing everyday life was adapted to their limited abilities and energy. This required detailed planning, good knowledge of their breathing and body. Women were afraid of contracting life-threatening infections that caused suffering, especially COVID-19. The fear leads to isolation and digital media was described as an important means of communication. Significant others gave support and help that was practical and emotional. Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced lack of continuous help and support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength required women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV to conduct detailed planning to manage everyday life. Being afraid of contracting infections and the consequences of suffocation had increased since the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, which led to self-isolation and an inactive everyday life.

A systematic search with related search terms in the PubMed, Ebsco (Academic Search Ultimate), Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Medline (Ebsco), Cinahl (Ebsco), Scopus and Web of Science was conducted up to June 2021. Statistical analysis was performed with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software Version 3 (CMA V3, Biostat Inc) comparing before and after values of mean  standard deviation (SD) data in both groups. The primary outcome of interest was severity of FM (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), whereas secondary outcomes were pain intensity (visual analog scale, numeric pain rating scale), catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) and anxiety (HADS). The initial search strategy based on the range and language yielded 274 relevant studies and 4 of these studies met the final eligibility criteria for this study.

Crizotinib was the first ALK-targeted inhibitor used in clinics, but relapses are now known to occur. Current research efforts indicate that combined therapies could represent a superior strategy to eradicate malignant cells and prevent tumor recurrence. Autophagy is a self-digestion cellular process, known to be induced upon diverse cancer therapies. Our present work demonstrates that the potentiation of the crizotinib-induced autophagy flux, through the serine/threonine kinase RAF1 downregulation, drives ALK+ ALCL cells to death. These results should encourage further investigations on the therapeutic modulation of autophagy in this particular cancer settings and other ALK-related malignancies. ABSTRACT: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALK+ ALCL) are an aggressive pediatric disease. The therapeutic options comprise chemotherapy, which is efficient in approximately 70% of patients, and targeted therapies, such as crizotinib (an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)), used in refractory/relapsed cases. Research efforts have also converged toward the development of combined therapies to improve treatment. In this context, we studied whether autophagy could be modulated to improve crizotinib therapy. Autophagy is a vesicular recycling pathway, known to be associated with either cell survival or cell death depending on the cancer and therapy. We previously demonstrated that crizotinib induced cytoprotective autophagy in ALK+ lymphoma cells and that its further intensification was associated with cell death. In line with these results, we show here that combined ALK and Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma 1 (RAF1) inhibition, using pharmacological (vemurafenib) or molecular (small interfering RNA targeting RAF1 (siRAF1) or microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) mimics) strategies, also triggered autophagy and potentiated the toxicity of TKI. Mechanistically, we found that this combined therapy resulted in the decrease of the inhibitory phosphorylation on Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) (a key protein in autophagy initiation), which may account for the enforced autophagy and cytokilling effect. Altogether, our results support the development of ALK and RAF1 combined inhibition as a new therapeutic approach in ALK+ ALCL.","output":"High Levels of miR-7-5p Potentiate Crizotinib-Induced Cytokilling and Autophagic Flux by Targeting RAF1 in NPM-ALK Positive Lymphoma Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serotonin is a phylogenetically ancient compound found in animals, plants, and some bacteria. In eukaryotes, serotonin is synthesized from the aromatic amino acid tryptophan via the key enzymes aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (AAAH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). Serotonin is also an intermediate in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway and is involved in several vital functions. In humans, serotonin is produced in the gut and in the brain, is critical in the regulation of multiple body functions, and its depletion has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders including depression and Alzheimer's disease, as well as other peripheral conditions namely irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. The serotonin biosynthetic pathway is well described in eukaryotes, but very little is known about this pathway in bacteria. Evidence points to similar pathways since eukaryote-like AAAH and AAAD (and their genes) have been identified in multiple bacteria, even though serotonin production has not yet been detected in most species. Although data on bacterial tryptophan decarboxylase genes are very limited and no bacterial tryptophan hydroxylase genes have been identified to date, evidence suggests that serotonin production in bacteria might occur through different AAAH and AAAD. Substrate promiscuity in these enzymes has been previously reported and seems to be the key aspect in bacterial serotonin synthesis. Considering the human gut microbiota as a potential source of serotonin, further investigation on its biosynthetic pathways in microbes might lead to important discoveries, which may ultimately foster the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat serotonin depletion-related disorders in humans.","output":"Enzyme Promiscuity in Serotonin Biosynthesis, From Bacteria to Plants and Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-volume testing of clinical specimens for sexually transmitted diseases is performed frequently by a process known as group testing. This algorithmic process involves testing portions of specimens from separate individuals together as one unit (or \\"group\\") to detect diseases. Retesting is performed on groups that test positively in order to differentiate between positive and negative individual specimens. The overall goal is to use the least number of tests possible across all individuals without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. One of the most efficient group testing algorithms is array testing. In its simplest form, specimens are arranged into a grid-like structure so that row and column groups can be formed. Positive-testing rows/columns indicate which specimens to retest. With the growing use of multiplex assays, the increasing number of diseases tested by these assays, and the availability of subject-specific risk information, opportunities exist to make this testing process even more efficient. We propose specific specimen arrangements within an array that can reduce the number of retests needed when compared with other array testing algorithms. We examine how to calculate operating characteristics, including the expected number of tests and the SD for the number of tests, and then subsequently find a best arrangement.

It is not clear whether the use of biological agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID-19 occur as a result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID-19 disease and more recently JAK1/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: To estimate COVID-19 infection rate in patients treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RMD), determine the influence of biological agents treatment as risk or protective factors and study the prognosis of patients with rheumatic diseases receiving biological agents compared to the general population in a third-level hospital setting in Len, Spain. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at our rheumatology department who received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and December 1st 2020, and analysed COVID-19 infection rate. All patients who attended our rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biological agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biological agent, duration of treatment, mean dose of glucocorticoids and need for intensive care unit . We performed an univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess risk factors of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: There were a total of 4464 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. 40 patients out of a total of 820 patients with rheumatic diseases (4.8%) receiving bDMARDs contracted COVID-19 and 4 required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 3.6%, and it was 0.89% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. 90% of patients receiving bDMARDS with COVID-19 did not require hospitalisation. Out of the 4464 patients, 869 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biological agents. Patients with rheumatic diseases who tested positive for COVID-19 were older (female: median age 60.8 IQR 46-74; male: median age 61.9 IQR 52-70.3) than those who were negative for COVID-19 (female: median age 58.3 IQR 48-69; male: median age 56.2 IQR 47-66), more likely to have hypertension (45% vs 26%, OR 2.25 (CI 1.18-4.27),p 0.02), cardiovascular disease (23 % vs 9.6%, OR 2.73 (1.25-5.95), p 0.02), be smokers (13% vs 4.6%, OR 2.95 (CI 1.09-7.98), p 0.04), receiving treatment with rituximab (20% vs 8%, 2.28 (CI 1.24-6.32), p 0.02) and a higher dose of glucocorticoids (OR 2.5 (1.3-10.33, p 0.02) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL-6 inhibitors (2.5% vs 14%, OR 0.16, (CI 0.10-0.97, p 0.03). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bDMARD proportions. IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab-treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID-19 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and patients who tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID-19. Patients with rheumatic disease diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to be receiving a higher dose of glucocorticoids and treatment with rituximab.

An -L-fucosidase gene (PbFuc) from Pedobacter sp. CAU209 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity of 36.8% with the amino sequences of other reported -L-fucosidases. The purified -L-fucosidase (PbFuc) had a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme exhibited specific activity (26.3 U/mg) towards 4-nitrophenyl--L-fucopyranoside (pNP-FUC), 3'FL (8.9 U/mg), and 2'FL (3.4 U/mg).

Despite evidence indicating that OUD may be particularly severe for women, preclinical models have yet to establish sex as a major factor in OUD. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined sex differences in vulnerability to relapse following intermittent access fentanyl self-administration and protracted abstinence and used buprenorphine, the FDA-approved treatment for OUD, to test the validity of our model. METHODS: Following acquisition of fentanyl self-administration under one of two training conditions, male and female rats were given extended, 24-h/day access to fentanyl (0.25 g/kg/infusion, 10 days) using an intermittent access procedure. Vulnerability to relapse was assessed using an extinction/cue-induced reinstatement procedure following 14 days of abstinence; buprenorphine (0 or 3 mg/kg/day) was administered throughout abstinence. RESULTS: Levels of drug-seeking were high following extended-access fentanyl self-administration and abstinence; buprenorphine markedly decreased drug-seeking supporting the validity of our relapse model. Females self-administered more fentanyl and responded at higher levels during subsequent extinction testing. Buprenorphine was effective in both sexes and eliminated sex and estrous phase differences in drug-seeking. Interestingly, the inclusion of a time-out during training had a major impact on later fentanyl self-administration in females, but not males, indicating that the initial exposure conditions can persistently impact vulnerability in females.

Therefore, infection prevention and control measures for this specialty are essential. Literatures on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and infection control measures of COVID-19 were reviewed, practical knowledge from first-line otolaryngologists in China, the United States, and Brazil were reviewed and collated. It was recommended that otolaryngology professionals should improve screening in suspected patients with relevant nasal and pharyngeal symptoms and signs, suspend non-emergency consultations and examinations in clinics, and rearrange the working procedures in operating rooms. The guidelines of personal protective equipment for swab sampling, endoscopy and surgery were listed. Indications for tracheotomy during the pandemic should be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary airway opening and aerosol-generation; precautions during surgery to reduce the risk of exposure and infection were illustrated.

In this paper we employ standard life table methods to illustrate how the potential quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with COVID-19 fatalities could be estimated, while adjusting for comorbidities in terms of impact on both mortality and quality of life. Contrary to some suggestions in the media, we find that even relatively elderly patients with high levels of comorbidity can still lose substantial life years and QALYs. The simplicity of the method facilitates straightforward international comparisons as the pandemic evolves. In particular, we compare five different countries and show that differences in the average QALY losses for each COVID-19 fatality is driven mainly by differing age distributions for those dying of the disease.","output":"Estimating (quality-adjusted) life-year losses associated with deaths: With application to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review primarily examines the evidence for areas of consensus and on-going uncertainty or controversy about diet and physical exercise approaches for in the post-CoVID.

The increased use of digital technologies in higher education has lately been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, thus creating a number of challenges related to the implementation of distance e-learning. The duration of the epidemic situation and the limitations related to the organization of in-person education reveal the simulation training as the main opportunity for the implementation of any practical training of the students in the methodological disciplines in their university preparation as future teachers. The aim of the study is to survey the possibilities of developing the modeling competence of students concerning the simulation of practical training in computer-based distance learning. Research methods. Within the framework of the research, which is oriented at establishing the levels of structure defining competencies (the reflective multisensory competency;the creative competency;the symbolic competency of sign and symbol nature) were measured systematically through goal-oriented observation during practice seminars in the disciplines taught to students. Since both disciplines are practically oriented and suggest the instruction of teaching methods, they entail the design of didactic situations in pre-school and of lessons in primary school education, which facilitates the registering of the levels of structure defining competences, including the competence for cognitive modelling, preeminently formed in the conditions of simulative distance education in electronic environment. The subjects participating in the research are 158 Bachelor's students trained in the professional field Education Science. Results. A low level of the skills for the application of cognitive modelling in the activities students conduct in relation to the design of pedagogical situation and lessons as an element in their practical experience and preparation in the realization of such situations in rela school conditions. The pilot study diagnoses a low level of student achievements in over 65% of the subjects as regards the academic disciplines the study concerns in terms of basic modelling skills. By contrast, in the course of the simulative education a growth of 45% has been established in the concluding study. The intersections and correlations between the level of development of the specific competences and the simulative education have also been established. Statistically verifiable differences (p=<0.05) were established between the pilot and the concluding studies in view of the reflective and creative competency. The symbolizing competency, however, requires further efforts. Conclusion. The results draw the attention to the necessity to look for opportunities to guarantee the creation of the models, in the context of simulative education, with three basic emphases: state (value, role and function in the specific context, phase of development of the pedagogical situation and/or lesson), structure (position of the model in relation to the other models/objects and of its own components - the components of the pedagogical situations and lesson projects) and evolution (opportunities for the design of pedagogical situations and/or lessons after reflection based on simulations). ? 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Therefore, in this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and gene ontology on RNAseq data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. Differential expression analysis revealed that 753 genes were up-regulated while 746 down-regulated. SNORA81, OAS2, SYCP2, LOC100506985, and SNORD35B are the top 5 upregulated genes upon SARS-Cov-2 infection. Expectedly, these genes have been implicated in the immune response to viral assaults. In the Ontology of protein classification, a high percentage of the genes are classified as Gene-specific transcriptional regulator, metabolite interconversion enzyme, and Protein modifying enzymes. Twenty pathways with P-value lower than 0.05 were enriched in the up-regulated genes while 18 pathways are enriched in the down-regulated DEGs. The toll-like receptor signalling pathway is one of the major pathways enriched. This pathway plays an important role in the innate immune system by identifying the pathogen-associated molecular signature emanating from various microorganisms.

In particular, thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 are common and contribute to organ failure and mortality. Patients with severe COVID-19 present with hemostatic abnormalities that mimic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy associated with sepsis, with the major difference being increased risk of thrombosis rather than bleeding. However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection alters platelet function to contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unknown. In this study, we report altered platelet gene expression and functional responses in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. RNA sequencing demonstrated distinct changes in the gene-expression profile of circulating platelets of COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis revealed differential gene-expression changes in pathways associated with protein ubiquitination, antigen presentation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 binding, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was not detected by messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein in platelets. Surprisingly, mRNA from the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene was detected in platelets from 2 of 25 COVID-19 patients, suggesting that platelets may take-up SARS-COV-2 mRNA independent of ACE2. Resting platelets from COVID-19 patients had increased P-selectin expression basally and upon activation. Circulating platelet-neutrophil, -monocyte, and -T-cell aggregates were all significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, platelets from COVID-19 patients aggregated faster and showed increased spreading on both fibrinogen and collagen. The increase in platelet activation and aggregation could partially be attributed to increased MAPK pathway activation and thromboxane generation.

Although attention has been focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to the limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real-time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. METHODS: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an assessment within the Ada app in Germany and the United Kingdom was conducted between two periods, namely before and after the implementation of \\"Phase One\\" COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using a Pearson chi-square test and reported as log2 fold changes. RESULTS: Overall, 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Overall, 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the United Kingdom reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany: 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; United Kingdom: 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority were aged 10-29 years (Germany: 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; United Kingdom: 50,900/68,800, 73.91%), and about one-quarter were aged 30-59 years (Germany: 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; United Kingdom: 14,900/68,800, 21.65%). Overall, 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures period as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were reported in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (log2 fold change, P value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. In total, 14 of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","output":"Syndromic Surveillance Insights from a Symptom Assessment App Before and During COVID-19 Measures in Germany and the United Kingdom: Results From Repeated Cross-Sectional Analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made it more challenging for patients to undergo yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization (RE) Same day Y-90 RE provides an opportunity to minimize logistical challenges and infection risk associated with COVID-19, thus improving patient access AIM: To describe the use of same day Y-90 RE with routine single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in order to optimize therapy METHODS: All patients were selected for Y-90 RE through a multidisciplinary tumor board, and were screened and tested for COVID-19 infection per institutional protocol A same day procedure was developed, consisting of angiography, imaging, and Y-90 resin particle delivery Routine SPECT/CT after technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m MAA) administration was performed for assessment of arterial supply, personalized dosimetry, and extrahepatic activity Post-treatment Y-90 bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT was performed for confirmation of particle delivery, by utilization of energy windowing to limit signal from previously administered Tc-99m MAA particles RESULTS: A total of 14 patients underwent same day Y-90 RE between March and June 2020 Mean lung shunt fraction was 6 13% (range 3 5%-13 1%) Y-90 RE was performed for a single lesion in 7 patients, while the remaining 7 patients had treatment of multifocal lesions The largest lesion measured 8 3 cm All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged the same day CONCLUSION: Same day Y-90 RE with resin-based microspheres is feasible, and provides an opportunity to mitigate infection risk and logistical challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond We recommend consideration of SPECT/CT, especially among patients with complex malignancies, for the potential to improve outcomes and eligibility of patients to undergo same day Y-90 RE","output":"Same day yttrium-90 radioembolization with single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography: An opportunity to improve care during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide threat, and information on physiopathological aspects of the disease is limited.

The aim of this study was to assess the of diet-related diseases among a multi-racial/ethnic uninsured group in South Florida. METHODS: Electronic heath records of adult patients (N = 272) from a free clinic in South Florida, a 4-week pre COVID-19 pandemic de-identified dataset was analyzed. Presence of diet-related conditions for each patient was quantified. Numerical and categorical data were compared using independent t-test and Chi-Squared test, respectively. Spearman\`s correlation, multi-linear regression, and binary regression models were used to assess the relationship between the variables. RESULTS: The sample included females (65%) and males (35%). The mean age was 49.08  14.56 years. There were 26.5% Whites, 33.8% Blacks, 35.6% Asians/Asian-Indians, and 1.1% American Indians. About 24% were Hispanic/Latino. The mean BMI was 29.45  6.76 kg/m2 (n = 250). Overall, 87% of patients had at least one diet-related condition with overweight/obesity being the most observed (75.2%), followed by hypertension (39%), dyslipidemia (27.2%), and diabetes (23.9%). The inter-racial analysis revealed that BMI is a significant predictor of prevalence of hypertension among Whites (P = 0.008) and Blacks (P = 0.002), but not Asians/Asian-Indians (P = 0.536). BMI was a significant predictor of prevalence of dyslipidemia (P = 0.027) and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.006) among Hispanics/Latinos.

The heterogeneous conditions of the students and the combined face-to-face and online teaching requirements made the teachers change the current teaching model based only on theoretical classes and individual practical exercises, to a more flexible schedule following a Project-based active learning scheme. One of the problems that the teachers found in this subject and the masters degree in general is the difference in knowledge between the students in the different areas that the subject cover. This is due to the heterogeneity of students who come from different degrees from various universities and even countries. Also, in this course, the teachers must deal with the situation that the incoming students graduated in the Degree in Robotics Engineering (University of Alicante) already have most of the knowledge that this and other subjects cover. This project-based learning is therefore intended to promote self-teaching to allow the most advanced students to get a deep teaching experience while the others learn the basics of the subject. The other great challenge the teachers must deal with is the adaptation to the current face-to-face and online combined teaching classes. As the proposed projects must be carried out using the robotics laboratory hardware, a carefully designed schedule for sharing the resources was made, with special attention to the current cleaning requirements. All these factors make us think that project-based learning will allow all students to acquire the appropriate skills.

It can be assumed that Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), both classic hemolytic and associated with aplastic anemia, particularly on treatment with complement inhibitors, may be more susceptible and have higher morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 than the general population. Italy has been heavily affected from the COVID-19 outbreak with the peak of contagions at the end of March 2020. As of July, 23 2020 the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Italy was 0.4% (1 case every 246 residents) (ranging from 0.06% - 1/1621- in Calabria to 0.9% - 1/106 - in Lombardy). We conducted a survey on 126 patients with PNH (77 females/49 males, median age 48 years, range 19-86) among 7 reference Italian centers in order to evaluate the occurrence and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection from the outbreak until the time of writing. According to International PNH Interest Group (IPIG) classification, 95 patients suffered from classic hemolytic PNH, 24 had associated bone marrow failures (aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome), and 7 had subclinical PNH (clone size <10%). Sixty-nine cases were on complement fraction 5 (C5) inhibition (72 eculizumab and 19 ravulizumab). Comorbidities were present in 33 patients, including arterial hypertension (N=14), ischemic cardiomyopathy (N=3), atrial fibrillation (N=2), diabetes mellitus (N=2), breast cancer (N=3), colon cancer (N=1), prostate cancer (N=1), Crohn disease (N=1), and Hashimoto thyroiditis (N=1). During the observation period, only one patient (55 years female), from Milan, Lombardy, not on C5-inhibitor was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (positive swab, ageusia, and mild fever for few days). No hemolytic flare occurred, nor hospital admission was required. She received azithromycin and low molecular heparin. Other 6 patients, all on C5-inhibitors, experienced fever (N=5) and cough (N=2), and/or dysgeusia (N=1), of whom 2 experienced breakthrough hemolysis (BTH), but swabs and CT scans (N=2) were negative. At variance, 6 patients (4 on eculizumab and 2 on ravulizumab) experienced BTH without COVID-19 symptoms. Interestingly, a young male patient on eculizumab, working as medical doctor in a COVID-19 ward, did not contract the infection. In conclusion, this survey suggests that PNH subjects, either on complement inhibition or not, are not at significantly higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared with the general population. As a matter of fact, the basic protective measures against COVID-19 have always been advised to PNH patients particularly during treatment and were presumably carefully followed during the pandemic. On the other hand, immune activation and inflammation are thought to play an important role in the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Complement inhibition, which is under investigation in COVID-19 disease, seems at least not disadvantageous in PNH.

In this article, we propose a novel causal structural learning algorithm to discover important covariates and potential causal pathways for 90-90-90 targets. Existing constrained-based causal structural learning algorithms are quite aggressive in edge removal. The proposed algorithm preserves more information about important features and potential causal pathways. It is applied to the Malawi PHIA (MPHIA) data set and leads to interesting results. For example, it discovers age and condom usage to be important for female HIV awareness; the number of sexual partners to be important for male HIV awareness; and knowing the travel time to HIV care facilities leads to a higher chance of being treated for both females and males. We further compare and validate the proposed algorithm using BIC and using Monte Carlo simulations, and show that the proposed algorithm achieves improvement in true positive rates in important feature discovery over existing algorithms.","output":"Causal Structural Learning on MPHIA Individual Dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by the global unrest related to the COVID-19 pandemic, this demo paper presents a system for acquisition of COVID-related data from different, public sources, and interlinking under a common semantic data model at a fine level of granularity.

The ability to identify individuals at risk of developing chronic disease, particularly multimorbidity, reliably, and simply, and to identify undiagnosed disorders, is vital to reducing the global burden of disease. This narrative review, the first of recent studies, demonstrates that raised faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) is associated with increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality and with longer-term conditions including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and psoriasis, and with probable intake of particulate matter. We and others have hypothesized that elevated f-Hb (measured using a faecal immunochemical test) has considerable potential to identify individuals at risk of, or who already have, early stage, undiagnosed chronic disease. If f-Hb does prove to be an effective biomarker for chronic disease and multimorbidity, individuals with detectable f-Hb, but without an obvious source of gastrointestinal blood loss, could benefit from further assessment and early intervention.

Many repurposed drugs have progressed rapidly to Phase 2 and 3 trials without characterisation of Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) including safety in COVID-19. One such drug is Nafamostat Mesylate (Nafamostat), a synthetic serine protease inhibitor with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Preclinical data has demonstrated that it is has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 by directly inhibiting the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent stage of host cell entry. Methods: We present the findings of a phase Ib/II open label, platform randomised controlled trial (RCT), exploring the safety of intravenous Nafamostat in hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonitis. Patients were assigned randomly to standard of care (SoC), Nafamostat or an alternative therapy. Secondary endpoints included clinical endpoints such as number of oxygen free days and clinical improvement/ deterioration, PK/PD, thromboelastometry, D Dimers, cytokines, immune cell flow cytometry and viral load. Results: Data is reported from 42 patients, 21 of which were randomly assigned to receive intravenous Nafamostat. The Nafamostat group developed significantly higher plasma creatinine levels, more adverse events and a lower number of oxygen free days. There were no other statistically significant differences in the primary or secondary endpoints between Nafamostat and SoC. PK data demonstrated that intravenous Nafamostat was rapidly broken down to inactive metabolites. We observed an antifibrinolytic profile, and no significant anticoagulant effects in thromboelastometry. Participants in the Nafamostat group had higher D Dimers compared to SoC. There were no differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and viral loads between the groups. Conclusion In hospitalised patients with COVID-19, we did not observe evidence of anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant or antiviral activity with intravenous Nafamostat. Given the number of negative trials with repurposed drugs, our experimental medicine trial highlights the value of PK/PD studies prior to selecting drugs for efficacy trials. Given the mechanism of action, further evaluation of Nafamostat delivered via a different route may be warranted. This trial demonstrates the importance of experimental trials in new disease entities such as COVID-19 prior to selecting drugs for larger trials.","output":"TITLE: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Nafamostat Mesylate in COVID pneumonitis: Phase 1b/2a Experimental Study to Investigate Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines sex differences regarding social skills, behavior problems and bullying engagement, and the association of social skills and behavior problems with bullying engagement, in adolescents.

This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes. Methods: Secondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions. Results: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic. Conclusions: Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth. The early implementation of lockdown initially decreased the doubling rate of cases and allowed time to upscale critical medical infrastructure. Measures such as asymptomatic testing, public-private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine can be developed and deployed in India.

If these activities are impaired, support is needed. Using data from GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS, we present how many people aged 55 and older living in private households in Germany experience limitations in activities of daily living. Severe limitations in basic (fundamental) activities (e.g. food intake) are reported by 5.8% of women and 3.7% of men. The proportion increases with age as 13.4% of women and 9.0% of men aged 80 and older experience limitations. Severe limitations of instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. grocery shopping) are rather rare in participants less than 80 years of age. But at age 80 and older the proportion rises to 35.9% of women and 21.0% of men. A total of 68.1% of afflicted women and 57.5% of men receive help and support related to limitations of basic activities. Women are also more likely to report a lack of support (48.8% vs. 43.2%). The situation is slightly better with regard to instrumental activities. The results of GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS show in which areas of daily life older and very old people are impaired, give an impression of who is affected particularly strongly and indicate where support services are insufficient.

Recently, CoV-MAC-TED was confirmed as promising marker by using primary target human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) infected by two SARS-CoV-2 variants with different effects on disease severity. To further explore this marker/cell system as a standardized tool for identifying anti-viral targets in general, testing of further virus types is required. Results: Transcriptome level profiles of H3N2 influenza-infected NECs indicated ROS/RNS level changes and increased transcript accumulation of genes related to glycolysis, lactic fermentation and -tubulin at 8 hours post infection. These early changes linked to energy-dependent, IRF9-marked rapid immunization. However, ReprogVirus-marker genes indicated the absence of initial cell cycle progress, which contrasted our findings during infections with two SARS-CoV-2 variants, where cell cycle progress was linked to delayed IRF9 response. Our results point to the possibility of CoV-MAC-TED-assisted, rapid individual host cell response identification upon virus infections. Conclusion: The complex trait CoV-MAC-TED can identify similar and differential early responses of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H3N2 viruses. This indicates its appropriateness to search for anti-viral targets in view of therapeutic design strategies. For standardization, human NECs can be used. This marker/cell system is promising to identify differential early cell responses upon viral infections also depending on cell origins.","output":"Transcriptome data from human nasal epithelial cells infected by H3N2 influenza virus indicate early unbalanced ROS/RNA levels, temporarily increased aerobic fermentation linked to enhanced -tubulin and rapid energy-dependent IRF9-marked immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesWe investigated the holistic experiences of university students during the pandemic.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of international evidence-based recommendations for school-related sedentary behaviours for children and youth, led by the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network (SBRN). METHODS: A panel of international experts was convened by SBRN in November 2020 to guide the development of these recommendations for children and youth aged ~ 5C18 years. The recommendations were informed by 1) age-relevant existing sedentary behaviour guidelines, 2) published research on the relationship between overall sedentary behaviour and health, 3) a de novo systematic review on the relationship between school-related sedentary behaviours and health and/or academic outcomes, and 4) a de novo environmental scan of the grey literature to identify existing recommendations for school-related sedentary behaviours. Draft recommendations were presented to the Expert Panel in June 2021. Following thorough discussion and modifications, updated recommendations were distributed for stakeholder feedback from July 9C26. Feedback was received from 148 stakeholders across 23 countries, leading to additional updates to the recommendations. Following further rounds of discussion and updates with the Expert Panel in August and September 2021, consensus was achieved on the final recommendations. RESULTS: A healthy day includes breaking up extended periods of sedentary behaviour and incorporating different types of movement into homework whenever possible, while limiting sedentary homework. School-related screen time should be meaningful, mentally or physically active, and serve a specific pedagogical purpose that enhances learning. Replacing sedentary learning activities with movement-based learning activities, and replacing screen-based learning activities with non-screen-based learning activities, can further support students health and wellbeing. DISCUSSION: This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for school-related sedentary behaviours for children and youth. These recommendations will support the work of parents, caregivers, educators, school system administrators, policy makers, researchers and healthcare providers interested in promoting student health and academic success.

Here, we address this problem with two distinct modeling approaches: a simple analytical model and a more simulation using the SEIRS+ platform. Both models indicate that proactive testing remains useful until a threshold level of vaccination is reached. This threshold depends on the transmissibility of the virus and the scope of other control measures in place. If a community is able to reach the threshold level of vaccination, testing can cease. Otherwise, continued testing will be an important component of disease control.

METHODS: According to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the WHO criteria (20 confirmed as cases of SARS) in 3 university teaching hospitals in Taipei between March 1 and April 20, 2003, the scoring system for SARS was designed by multivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters. We thereafter applied the scoring system for SARS to the consecutive 232 patients (the validation group) who met the WHO criteria of suspected cases from April 21 to May 22, 2003. Final diagnosis of SARS was determined by the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and paired serum. RESULTS: The scoring system for SARS was defined as radiographic findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrates (3 points), sputum monocyte predominance (3 points), lymphocytopenia (2 points), history of exposure (1 point), lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L (1 point), C-reactive protein more than 5.0 mg/dL (1 point), and activated partial prothrombin time more than 40 seconds (1 point). Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P<.001). At the cutoff value of 6 points, the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS were 100% and 93%, respectively.

A major policy question is whether e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19 pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services. Future research may combine the big-data-based analysis presented here with traditional methods to further shed light on the interactions between e-scooter services, bikesharing, and public transit.","output":"Do e-scooters fill mobility gaps and promote equity before and during COVID-19?

The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts/day (95% uncertainty interval-UI = 0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years, susceptibility was 0.06 in those &#8804;19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in &#8805;80 years. Assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was limited at 0.004 (95% UI = 0.002-0.008).

Methods: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, High Resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. Results: In this study, 279 patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 72 cases of colon cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer .However, in 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 3 case of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin Lymphoma, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; three of COVID-19 were observed. Conclusion: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures.

Well-mixed room models significantly underestimate the risk of infection for short and direct exposure. To this end, we estimate the upper bound for infection risk with the susceptible in the infectious exhalation cloud or wearing masks by having the masked susceptible inhale the entire exhalation of a masked infectious. Social distances without a mask, even at 3m between speaking individuals results in an upper bound of 90\\\\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If both wear a surgical mask, the risk of infection for the person speaking remains below 26\\\\% even after 60 minutes. When both the infectious and susceptible wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, the upper bound for risk is reduced by a factor of 60 compared to surgical masks. In both cases, face leakage is very important. For FFP2 masks, leakage is low in the nasal region and directed upward, which can be further reduced significantly by applying double-sided medical tape there. Considering that the calculated upper bound greatly overestimates the risk of infection, and the fact that with a poorly worn mask even the upper bound we calculated is very low, we conclude that wearing a mask, even with some leakage, provides excellent third party and self-protection.","output":"Face-masks save us from SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has affected humanity and education worldwide as continued learning amidst massive school closures required the unprecedented decision to make a rapid transition from in-person learning to remote online learning This abrupt and temporary shift to remote online learning due to crisis circumstances was described as emergency remote teaching (ERT) Using a multi-method approach, this study aimed to explore college students' emergency remote teaching experiences during the COVID-19 crisis Analysis of online survey data revealed the various detrimental effects of the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and emergency remote teaching on the participants' educational and personal experiences The results revealed not only that the participants have experienced learning loss and lack of motivation, but also that the pre-existing educational and social inequities seemed exacerbated and amplified during ERT and the COVID-19 crisis Issues in terms of accessibility, digital divide, inequity, and mental/emotional/physical health that the participants, more likely females, experienced during emergency remote learning were especially concerning The results highlighted the importance of addressing and combating the inequities, creating and maintaining a sense of community, and most significantly providing socio-emotional support, 'TLC' (Tender Loving Care;TLC (Tender Loving Care) is an expression, describing extra attention to make someone or something look or feel better), and compassion, to college students and the instructors during the uncertain times and as we move forward","output":"Needs a little TLC: examining college students' emergency remote teaching and learning experiences during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most widely-used assays for studying viral entry, including infectivity, cofloatation, and cell-cell fusion assays, yield functional information but provide low resolution of individual entry steps.

Methods: This phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18 to 54 and 55 to 75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 {micro}g, 9 {micro}g or 30 {micro}g SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. Findings: We report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults.

Using in silico approaches, we have identified drugs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 helicase based on the presence of amino acid arrangements matching binding sites of drugs in previously annotated protein structures. The drugs exhibiting an RMSD of  3.0 ? were further analyzed using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and post-MD analyses. Using these approaches, we found 12 drugs that showed strong interactions with SARS-CoV-2 helicase amino acids. The analyses were performed using the recently available SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure (PDB ID: 5RL6). Based on the MM-GBSA approach, out of the 12 drugs, two drugs, namely posaconazole and grazoprevir, showed the most favorable binding energy, ? 54.8 and ? 49.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, of the amino acids found conserved among all human coronaviruses, 10/11 and 10/12 were targeted by, respectively, grazoprevir and posaconazole. These residues are part of the crucial DEAD-like helicase C and DEXXQc_Upf1-like/ DEAD-like helicase domains. Strong interactions of posaconazole and grazoprevir with conserved amino acids indicate that the drugs can be potent against SARS-CoV-2. Since the amino acids are conserved among the human coronaviruses, the virus is unlikely to develop resistance mutations against these drugs.

Multiple toxic stressors and behaviors contribute to underlying immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the dysfunctional immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID-19. We have previously identified many contributing factors (CFs) (representing toxic exposure, lifestyle factors and psychosocial stressors) common to myriad chronic diseases. We hypothesized significant overlap between CFs associated with COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), because of the strong role immune dysfunction plays in each disease. A streamlined dot-product approach was used to identify potential CFs to COVID-19 and IBD. Of the fifty CFs to COVID-19 that were validated for demonstration purposes, approximately half had direct impact on COVID-19 (the CF and COVID-19 were mentioned in the same record; i.e., CF---COVID-19), and the other half had indirect impact. The nascent character of the COVID-19 core literature ( one year old) did not allow sufficient time for the direct impacts of many CFs on COVID-19 to be identified. Therefore, an immune system dysfunction (ID) literature directly related to the COVID-19 core literature was used to augment the COVID-19 core literature and provide the remaining CFs that impacted COVID-19 indirectly (i.e., CF---immune system dysfunction---COVID-19). Approximately 13000 potential CFs for myriad diseases (obtained from government and university toxic substance lists) served as the starting point for the dot-product identification process. These phrases were intersected (dot-product) with phrases extracted from a PubMed-derived IBD core literature, a nascent COVID-19 core literature, and the COVID-19-related immune system dysfunction (ID) core literature to identify common ID/COVID-19 and IBD CFs. Approximately 3000 potential CFs common to both ID and IBD, almost 2300 potential CFs common to ID and COVID-19, and over 1900 potential CFs common to IBD and COVID-19 were identified. As proof of concept, we validated fifty of these 3000 overlapping ID/IBD candidate CFs with biologic plausibility. We further validated 24 of the fifty as common CFs in the IBD and nascent COVID-19 core literatures. This significant finding demonstrated that the CFs indirectly related to COVID-19 -- identified with use of the immune system dysfunction literature -- are strong candidates to emerge eventually as CFs directly related to COVID-19. As discussed in the main text, many more CFs common to all these core literatures could be identified and validated. ID and IBD share many common risk/contributing factors, including behaviors and toxic exposures that impair immune function. A key component to immune system health is removal of those factors that contribute to immune system dysfunction in the first place. This requires a paradigm shift from traditional Western medicine, which often focuses on treatment, rather than prevention.","output":"Common contributing factors to COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various organizations and societies around the globe have issued guidelines in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and virus (SARS-CoV-2).

All guidelines emphasize the importance of ventilation, but the specific ventilation rate that can eliminate the risk of transmission of airborne particulate matter has not been established. The most important countermeasure, commonly agreed countermeasures, the conflicting content from different guidelines, and further work have been summarized in this paper.","output":"Review and comparison of HVAC operation guidelines in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Remote-management of COPD: Evaluating Implementation of Digital Innovations to Enable Routine Care (RECEIVER, NCT04240353) observational cohort trial (Figure presented) commenced September 2019 Clinician-patient co-designed progressive web application captures patient-reported outcomes (PROs), Fitbit and home NIV data, and provides self-management resources including asynchronous messaging Cloud-based clinician dashboard integrates these with clinical summary and event data Inclusion criteria are diagnosis of COPD with recent severe exacerbation and/or chronic hypercapnia, and daily access to smartphone, tablet or computer Primary endpoint is patient use of the application Secondary endpoints include impact on clinical outcomes and deriving AI-based risk predictive models Methods: We performed a planned interim effectiveness analysis of recruitment, patient-app utilisation and clinical outcomes at week 40, reflecting a minimum of 3 months follow up per patient Results: 283 patients were screened with 83 patients (average age 65 years) enrolled in RECEIVER by March 2020 Recruitment was paused then due to COVID-19 pandemic 25/83 patients had home NIV or CPAP Of the 143 excluded patients, 41 had no access to technology (average age 71 yrs), 42 had not had a recent exacerbation (average age 67 yrs) and 23 declined to participate (average age 67 yrs) An average of 4 6/patient/week daily PROs were completed, with usage sustained through to week 40 Improvement in patient outcomes versus their preceding year, with reduction in annualised admissions, occupied bed days and community reviews is noted (figure 1) Improved event ratios are maintained in subgroup analyses of home NIV patients, and if follow up is censored at UK COVID-19 lockdown Conclusion: Interim analyses of the RECEIVER trial are encouraging, with sustained patient use of the application, and associated positive impact on patient outcomes Older age of patients lacking access to digital technology is notable To support post COVID-19 NHS recovery we have scaled-up the digital self-management service, offering this to all COPD patients in NHS GG&C RECEIVER trial dataset will be combined with large NHS GG&C SafeHaven historical cohort and the scale-up patient data for machine-learning analyses We aim to train, validate and operationalise prediction models for 12-month mortality, 3-month re-admission and 72-hour exacerbation risk","output":"Receiver trial interim analysis: Reduction in COPD admissions with digitally supported self-management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explain the role of African American survivor advocates in addressing breast cancer disparities.

Attaching filters that remove viral particles in air from the expiratory limb of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices should theoretically decrease the risk. However, adding filters to the expiratory limb could add to expiratory resistance and thereby increase the imposed work of breathing (WOB). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects on imposed WOB when attaching filters to the expiratory limb of CPAP devices. METHODS Two filters were tested on three CPAP systems at two levels of CPAP in a mechanical lung model. Main outcome was imposed WOB. RESULTS There was a minor increase in imposed WOB when attaching the filters. The differences between the two filters were small. CONCLUSION To minimise contaminated aerosol generation during CPAP treatment, filters can be attached to expiratory tubing with only a minimal increase in imposed WOB in a non-humidified environment. Care has to be taken to avoid filter obstruction and replace filters as recommended.","output":"COVID-19: minimising contaminated aerosol spreading during CPAP treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 1 and 2 are a major cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in South Asia. Despite the high risk of death among infected pregnant women, scarce incidence data has been a contributing factor to global policy recommendations against the introduction of licensed hepatitis E vaccines, one of the only effective prevention tools. METHODS: We tested serum from a nationally representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV immunoglobulin G and estimated seroprevalence. We used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high-resolution maps of seropositivity and examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression. RESULTS: We tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%C24%). Seropositivity increased with age and male sex (odds ratio, 2.2 male vs female; 95% CI, 1.8C2.8). Community-level seroprevalence ranged widely (0C78%) with higher seroprevalence in urban areas, including Dhaka, with a 3.0-fold (95% credible interval, 2.3C3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh.

Based on student voices, this study aimed to improve online instruction. A qualitative case study approach was adopted, involving 12 university students from different subject disciplines and universities. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, followed by a series of qualitative data analysis procedures. The findings of this study suggested that our participants were generally satisfied with the way synchronous online lessons progressed, but that instructors' technical problems were common. Furthermore, the students' self-reported level of engagement tended to be negative due to, for example, lengthy lessons and poor group dynamics in virtual rooms. We also revealed the need for professional development opportunities for instructors to enhance their online teaching skills. Recommendations for improving online instruction are discussed, such as limiting online lessons to between 90 and 120 min, and allowing students to form their own groups, while helping shy students to join a group. This study thus has important implications for sustaining quality education in a fully online environment.","output":"How to Sustain Quality Education in a Fully Online Environment: A Qualitative Study of Students' Perceptions and Suggestions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a global pandemic occurred.

Preparing for a phased reopening, a knowledge exchange coalition (representing government, academia, hospitals, oral health professions, and regulators) developed return-to-work (RTW) guidelines detailing the augmentation of standard practices to ensure safety for patients, oral health care providers (OHPs), and the community. Using online surveys, this study explored the influence of the RTW guidelines and related education on registered NS OHPs during a phased return to work. METHODS: Dissemination of R2W guidelines included website or email communiques and interdisciplinary education webinars that coincided with 2 RTW phases approved by the government. Aligned with each phase, all registered dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants were invited to complete an online survey to gauge the influence of the coalition-sponsored education and RTW guidelines, confidence, preparedness, and personal protective equipment use before and after the pandemic. RESULTS: Three coalition-sponsored multidisciplinary webinars hosted 3541 attendees prior to RTW. The response to survey 1 was 41% (881/2156) and to survey 2 was 26% (571/2177) of registrants. Survey 1 (82%) and survey 2 (89%) respondents \\"agreed/strongly agreed\\" that R2W guidelines were a primary source for guiding return to practice, and most were confident with education received and had the skills needed to effectively treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This report describes an innovative process to address the safety of MSFW that utilized cohorting that eventually allowed for safe release to work in the fields on a large family farm in Iowa. Methods: Upon worker departure from Mexico, the employer arranged for bus seat assignments, mask use, and hand hygiene practice during the 3-day trip to Iowa. Upon arrival at the farm, surveillance testing and low-density housing cohorting based upon travel seat assignments allowed for early identification of infected workers and appropriate quarantine as per CDC guidelines. Upon completion of isolation or quarantine as appropriate, workers were released to congregate housing and work in the fields. Findings: Compared to a migrant farmworker COVID-19 outbreak without travel pre-planning, the cohorting process produced a 3.5% positivity rate compared to an earlier season July farmworker group on the same farm with a 12.7% positivity rate. Conclusions/Application to Practice: The success of this model points to the power of collaboration between farm employer, health care providers and workers to minimize worker infection and enable safe work in the fields. Increased state and federal support for MSFW protections could support infrastructure to proactively plan for prevention mechanisms to prevent the spread of known communicable disease.

Patients/Methods We carried out a retrospective observational study of 87 COVID-19 patients in Nmc Royal Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE. ADAMTS13 activity was measured and compared with patients' characteristics and clinical outcomes. Results Low ADAMTS13 level was associated with pneumonia (p=0.007), severity of COVID-19 (p<0.001), and mechanical ventilation rates (p=0.018). Death was more frequently observed among patients (5 patients) with low ADAMTS13 activity compared to normal activity (1 patient), as well as inflammatory markers.

We tested whether there is a long-term mortality difference between sexes for other microbes (viral and bacterial) response burden among older people. Methods: Seven-year follow-up study consisted of 382 home-dwelling people aged 75-90 years (65.2% females) with a history cardiovascular disease. At baseline, serum immunoglobulin G antibodies were assayed against herpesviruses (CMV, HSV-1 and HSV-2) and bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Helicobacter pylori). Titers were summed up as herpes (HB) or bacterial response burden (BB) and divided into tertiles. Hazard ratios (HR) of total mortality with 95% CIs were calculated using Cox regression. Results: The overall HB was lower and BB higher among males than females (P<0.001). There was a significant sex/HB (P=0.01) and sex/BB (P=0.03) interaction with mortality. Multivariable-adjusted (age, body mass index, C-reactive protein, and comorbidity index) mortality HRs for increasing HB sex-specific tertiles were 1.0 (reference), 1.34 (95% CI 0.62-2.88), and 2.66 (1.25-5.64) for males and 1.0, 1.30 (0.76-2.21), and 1.30 (0.77-2.22) for females.

However, there may also be racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates which, if present, would further exacerbate the existing disparities.

METHODS: Using data compiled from state health departments, we calculated racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination for the Black and Hispanic populations compared to the White population in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level index of structural racism and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination across states for both the Black and Hispanic populations by conducting linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination were present for both the Black and Hispanic populations in the overwhelming majority of states. There were vast differences between the states in the magnitude of the racial disparity in race-specific vaccination rates. These differences were largely explained by differences in the level of structural racism in each state. The relationship between structural racism and the racial disparities in vaccination was not entirely explained by racial differences in vaccine hesitancy or political affiliation. CONCLUSIONS: There are marked racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination throughout the USA, and structural racism is strongly associated with the magnitude of these disparities.

Demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and behavioral data were also collected, with administration of a three-question survey to determine adherence to social distancing measures with a focus on the level of social distancing practiced by participants, their routine activities, and circulation of people in the home. The association between sociodemographic data and social distancing was assessed using the chi-square test for linear trends in proportions, and the association between social distancing and seroprevalence was assessed using Poisson regression (95% confidence interval [95%CI]; P< 0.05). RESULTS. Of 4 252 tested and interviewed participants, 11.8% (95%CI: 10.8; 12.8) did not adhere to social distancing measures. The prevalence of a positive rapid test was 4.7% in participants who did not practice social distancing and 1.9% in participants who adhered to social distancing measures (P< 0.05).

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here, we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate, with B.1.1.7 vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus. P.1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers. However, all antigens protected from challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

Information about the contribution of interhospital transfer in improving access to EVT will help organize regional systems of stroke care. METHODS We analyzed trends of transfer-in EVT from a cohort of 1 863 693 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2143 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals between January 2012 and December 2017. We further examined the association between arrival mode and in-hospital outcomes by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Of the 37 260 patients who received EVT at 639 hospitals during the study period, 42.9% (15 975) arrived at the EVT-providing hospital after interhospital transfer. Transfer-in EVT cases increased from 256 in the first quarter 2012 to 1422 in the fourth quarter 2017, with sharply accelerated increases following the fourth quarter 2014 ( P<0.001 for change in linear trend). Transfer-in patients were younger and more likely to be of white race, to arrive during off-hours, and to be treated at comprehensive stroke centers. Transfer-in patients had significantly longer last-known-well-to-EVT initiation time (median, 289 minutes versus 213 minutes; absolute standardized difference, 67.33) but were more likely to have door-to-EVT initiation time of 90 minutes (65.6% versus 23.6%; absolute standardized difference, 93.18). In-hospital outcomes were worse for transfer-in patients undergoing EVT in unadjusted and in risk-adjusted models. Although the difference in in-hospital mortality disappeared after adjusting for delay in EVT initiation (14.7% versus 13.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92-1.11), transfer-in patients were still more likely to develop symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.0% versus 5.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29) and less likely to have either independent ambulation at discharge (33.1% versus 37.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95) or to be discharged to home (24.3% versus 29.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88). CONCLUSIONS Interhospital transfer for EVT is increasingly common and is associated with a significant delay in EVT initiation highlighting the need to develop more efficient stroke systems of care.

A virtual clinic was piloted to deliver preoperative health optimisation and shared decision-making for patients undergoing critical elective surgery. No literature existed on virtual preoperative clinics for older people to support the development. OBJECTIVE: this healthcare improvement study describes the setup and delivery of the virtual clinic as its primary aim. Secondary aims included: assessing older people's access to technology and their digital literacy for virtual consultation; to describe barriers and facilitators for consultations, as well as evaluation of patient and clinician satisfaction with the consultations' mode of delivery and outcomes. METHODS: a mixed methods healthcare improvement study was undertaken through plan-do-study-act cycles, semi-structure interviews, and quantitative service benchmarking. RESULTS: the pilot evaluated 67 preoperative consultations (43.3% video, 56.7% telephone, mean age 75) with a mix of surgical pathology (vascular 88.1%, colorectal 10.4%, urological 1.5%). Patient feedback demonstrated improved understanding of conditions (90.6%), and adequate opportunity to express opinions and questions (96.2%). Clinicians preferred video consultations (adequate to deliver services: 89.7% video; 68.4% telephone). The greatest barriers to engagement, none of which were exclusions to participation, included cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, or needing technical assistance setting up video consultations (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: delivering a virtual preoperative medical optimisation and shared decision clinic for older people is feasible.

Methods Online questionnaire surveys were conducted among 3 600 primary school students aged 6-12 years in Jilin Province, China in April, 2020 (during the epidemic) and 3 089 primary school students in September, 2020 (during the regular epidemic prevention and control). The general information and the data related to the Mental Health Scale for Child and Adolescent were collected by the questionnaire surveys. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors influencing the mental health status of the students during the epidemic. Results The students during the epidemic had a significantly poorer mental health status in the emotional experience and volitional behavior than those during the regular epidemic prevention and control (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the risk of psychological problems of the students decreased with age (OR=0.895). The girls were at a higher risk of psychological problems than boys (OR=1.453). The students with father's and mother's charater between irritability and gentle were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.496 and 0.470 respectively). The students from a family with a parental education style of a combination of encouraging and scolding were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.263).

Faced with this imbalance, how, when, and who decides, there is the impact of the stressful systems of professionals who are at the front line of care and, in the background, issues inherent to human subjectivity. Along this path, the idea of using artificial intelligence algorithms to replace health professionals in the decision-making process also arises.

The objective of this work is to reflect, from the point of view of medical ethics, on the basic principles of the choices made by the health teams, during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose resources are scarce and decisions cause anguish and restlessness. The ethical values for the rationing of health resources in an epidemic must converge to some proposals based on fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and recommending instrumental values, giving priority to critical situations. Naturally, different judgments will occur in different circumstances, but transparency is essential to ensure public trust.

This study explored healthcare providers perspectives on honouring eligible patients request for MAiD in the absence of a contemporaneous consent following their loss of decision-making capacity. METHOD: A critical qualitative methodology, using a feminist ethics theoretical lens with its focus on power and relationality, was used to examine how socio-political and environmental contexts influenced healthcare providers' moral agency and perspectives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 healthcare providers (13 physicians, six nurse practitioners, nine nurses and two social workers) from across Canada who provide MAiD-related care. RESULTS: Themes identified include; (1) balancing personal values and professional responsibilities, (2) anticipating strengths and limitations of the proposed waiver of final consent amendment, (3) experiencing ethical influences on decisions to enter into written agreements with eligible patients, (4) recognizing barriers to the enactment of MAiD in the absence of a contemporaneous consent and (5) navigating the potential for increased risks and burden. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Canada to explore healthcare providers perspectives on waiving the final consent for MAiD using a written agreement. Most participants supported expanding eligible peoples access to MAiD following loss of capacity, as they believed it would improve the patients comfort and minimize suffering. However, the lack of patients input at the time of provision and related ethical and legal challenges may impact healthcare providers moral agency and reduce some patients access to MAiD. Providers indicated they would enter into written agreements to waive final consent for MAiD on a case-by-case basis.

What should be the scenario for an inner Brazil and what can we do to control infection transmission in each one of these locations? In this paper, a mathematical model was developed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by the intensity and type of control measures. Mitigation strategies rely on social distancing of all individuals, and detection and isolation of infected ones. The model shows that control effort varies among cities.

Most tools rely on sequence based statistical comparisons, such as information entropy of residue positions in aligned columns to infer location and properties of epitope sites. To facilitate cross-structural comparisons of epitopes on viral surface proteins, a python-based extraction tool implemented with Jupyter notebook is presented (Jupytope). Given a viral antigen structure of interest, a list of known epitope sites and a reference structure, the corresponding epitope structural properties can quickly be obtained. The tool integrates biopython modules for commonly used software such as NACCESS, DSSP as well as residue depth and outputs a list of structure derived properties such as dihedral angles, solvent accessibility, residue depth and secondary structure that can be saved in several convenient data formats. To ensure correct spatial alignment, Jupytope takes a list of given epitope sites and their corresponding reference structure and aligns them before extracting the desired properties. Examples are demonstrated for epitopes of Influenza and SARS-CoV2 viral strains. The extracted properties assist detection of two Influenza subtypes and show potential in distinguishing between four major clades of SARS-CoV2, as compared with randomized labels. The tool will facilitate analytical and predictive works on viral epitopes through the extracted structural information.

The shared outcome of spongiform degeneration in these diverse diseases suggests that common cellular mechanisms must underlie the processes of spongiform change and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues reveals increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity in and around areas of spongiform change, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration. The link between aberrant ubiquitination and spongiform neurodegeneration has been strengthened by the discovery that a null mutation in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger-1 (Mgrn1) causes an autosomal recessively inherited form of spongiform neurodegeneration in animals. Recent studies have begun to suggest that abnormal ubiquitination may alter intracellular signaling and cell functions via proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent mechanisms, leading to spongiform degeneration and neuronal cell death.

Correlation coefficients for intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of classification were 0.723 and 0.598 (both, P < 0.001), respectively. About 40.8% (7 Type 1 and 13 Type 2) of the patients had fracture displacement >3 mm; Incidence of fracture displacement >3 mm was higher in Type 2 than Type 1 (61.9% vs 26.9%, P < 0.05). About 79.6% (20 Type 1, 17 Type 2 and 2 Type 3) of the patients were treated conservatively, and 20.4% (6 Type 1 and 4 Type 2) underwent surgery. At last follow-up, 47 out of 49 patients achieved fusion; overall fusion rate was 95.9%. All conservatively treated Type 1 and Type 3 patients achieved fusion. Out of 17 conservatively treated Type 2 patients, 15 achieved fusion but two developed nonunion; however, two nonunion patients opted not to undergo surgery. Subgroup analysis showed that Philadelphia brace caused nonunion significantly in fracture displacement >3 mm compared to Minerva brace/Halovest (100% vs 0%, P < 0.05). All surgically treated Type 1 and 2 patients achieved fusion. In terms of clinical outcomes, neck pain visual analog scale and neck disability index were significantly improved (both, P < 0.01). According to Odom's criteria, 93.9% (46/49) of the patients achieved satisfactory outcomes. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transverse fractures of C2 body can be treated conservatively. However, surgery or rigid Minerva brace/Halovest should be considered for Type 2 transverse fractures of the C2 body with fracture displacement >3 mm.","output":"Proposal of New Radiological Classification and Treatment Strategy for Transverse Fractures of the C2 Axis Body"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus that can manifest as an acute respiratory infection was discovered in China in mid-December 2019 and soon spread throughout the country and to the rest of the world. Although chest X-rays are the initial imaging technique of choice for low respiratory infections with or without dyspnea, few articles have reported the radiologic findings in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection attended at our hospital in March 2020. To analyze the frequency of COVID-19 compared to other respiratory infections, and to describe the radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included all children with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection (fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or dyspnea) that required chest X-rays in our hospital between March 1 and March 31. RESULTS: A total of 231 pediatric patients (90 (39%) girls and 141 (61%) boys; mean age, 4 y, range 1 month - 16 years) underwent chest X-rays for suspected respiratory infections. Most (88.4%) had mild symptoms; 29.9% had a family member positive for COVID-19 with symptoms similar to those of the patient. Nasal and/or throat swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR in the 47 (20.3%) children who presented at the emergency department; 3 (6.3%) of these were positive. Microbiological analyses were done in 85 (36.8%) of all patients, finding infections due to pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in 30 (35.3%). One of the patients with a PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 had urine infection due to E. coli and blood culture positive for S. viridans. Abnormalities were observed on X-rays in 73.2% of the patients. Peribronchial thickening was the most common abnormal finding, observed in 57% of patients. Parenchymal consolidations were observed in 38.5%, being bilateral in 29.2% and associated with pleural effusion in 3.3%. The interstitial lines were thickened in 7.3%, and 7.3% had ground-glass opacities. CONCLUSION: During March 2020, COVID-19 and other symptomatic respiratory infections were observed. The radiologic pattern of these infections is nonspecific, and chest X-rays alone are insufficient for the diagnosis. Children with clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 (with or without PCR confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2) had mild symptoms and most did not require admission or invasive mechanical ventilation. In a context of community transmission, the absence of a known epidemiological antecedent should not be a contraindication for PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Pediatric chest X-rays during the COVID-19 pandemic./ Radiografa de trax peditrica en la era COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vast majority of commercially available inactivated influenza vaccines are produced from egg-grown or cell-grown live influenza virus. The first step in the production process is virus inactivation with -propiolactone (BPL) or formaldehyde (FA). Recommendations for production of inactivated vaccines merely define the maximal concentration for both reagents, leaving the optimization of the process to the manufacturers. We assessed the effect of inactivation with BPL and FA on 5 different influenza virus strains. The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.","output":"Inactivated or damaged?

Previous research during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 established an increase of patient aggression in psychiatric facilities. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Despite expected worsening of mental health, our hospital observed reductions in aggressive behaviour among inpatients and subsequent use of coercive interventions by staff in the months following Covid-19 pandemic restrictions being implemented. The downward trend in incidents observed during the pandemic has suggested that aggression in mental health hospitals may be more situation-specific and less so a factor of mental illness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: We believe that the reduction in aggressive behaviour observed during the pandemic is related to changes in our organization that occurred in response to concerns about patient well-being; our co-design approach shifted trust, choice and power. Therefore, practices that support these constructs are needed to maintain the outcomes we experienced. Rather than return to normal in the wake of the pandemic, we are strongly encouraged to sustain the changes we made and continue to find better ways to support and work with the individuals who rely on or use our services. ABSTRACT: The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the operation of health care such that many services were put on hold as patients were triaged differently, people delayed seeking care, and transition to virtual care was enacted, including in psychiatric facilities. Most of the media dialogue has been negative; however, there have been some silver linings observed. Coinciding with the pandemic has been a reduction in aggressive incidents at our psychiatric hospital, along with the decreased need to use restraints and seclusion to manage behaviour. In this paper, we are taking stock of the changes that have occurred in response to the pandemic in an attempt to share our learnings and offer suggestions so that health care does not necessarily return to \\"normal\\".","output":"Silver linings: Observed reductions in aggression and use of restraints and seclusion in psychiatric inpatient care during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life expectancy has increased by three decades since the mid-twentieth century.

Acute ingestion of anthocyanins improves postprandial glucose responses to a single carbohydrate-rich meal under strictly controlled conditions. PURPOSE Examine whether acute and short-term supplementation with anthocyanin-rich New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract can improve postprandial glucose responses to mixed-macronutrient meals. METHODS Twenty-five overweight (BMI > 25 kg m2) sedentary individuals participated in one of the following double-blinded, randomised controlled trials: (1) ingestion of 600 mg NZBC extract or placebo prior to consumption of a high-carbohydrate, high-fat liquid meal (n = 12); (2) 8-days supplementation with NZBC extract (600 mg day-1) or placebo, with insulin sensitivity and markers of inflammation assessed on day-7, and free-living postprandial glucose (continuous glucose monitoring) assessed on day-8 (n = 13). RESULTS A single dose of NZBC extract had no effect on 3 h postprandial glucose, insulin or triglyceride responses. However, in response to short-term NZBC extract supplementation insulin sensitivity was improved (+ 22%; P = 0.011), circulating C-reactive protein concentrations decreased (P = 0.008), and free-living postprandial glucose responses to both breakfast and lunch meals were reduced (- 9% and - 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), compared to placebo. CONCLUSION These novel results indicate that repeated intake, rather than a single dose of NZBC extract, is required to induce beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose handling in individuals with overweight or obesity. Continuous glucose monitoring enabled an effect of NZBC extract to be observed under free-living conditions and highlights the potential of anthocyanin-rich supplements as a viable strategy to reduce insulin resistance.","output":"Short-term, but not acute, intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract improves insulin sensitivity and free-living postprandial glucose excursions in individuals with overweight or obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections with Eimeria parasites can lead to severe diarrhoea with considerable clinical and economic consequences in first-year grazing stock. To identify and characterise the cause of diarrhoea observed during previous years, 164 animals on 14 dairy farms in northwestern Germany were included in this study. The calves were physically and parasitologically examined prior to turnout and until 21 days post turnout (d.p.t.). Mean animal weights decreased from 194.9 kg at the start to 189.3 kg bodyweight at the end of the study. In all herds, oocyst counts were very low prior to turnout and increased after the calves had been kept on pasture for at least 7 days. On Day 9 post turnout, 90% and at the end of the study (21 d.p.t.) 70% of all animals showed Eimeria-positive faecal samples. During the course of the study, 79 (48.2%) animals passed faecal samples with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram. The predominant species identified was Eimeria alabamensis, which accounted for more than 83% of the oocysts counted. These parasitological findings matched the clinical observations. Diarrhoea was found in 130 (79.3%) of the study animals. At 5 d.p.t. and thus prior to the rise of faecal oocyst counts, a significant increase in diarrhoea was recorded. Calves showing diarrhoea excreted statistically significantly more often over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p = 0.0002) than calves without diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was also found during significantly more study days in animals with high oocyst counts (0.39; p = 0.0001). These data indicate that in endemic areas first-year grazing calves must be considered at risk to develop clinical coccidiosis due to E. alabamensis infection during the first 2C3 weeks post turnout.","output":"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Eimeria infections in first-year grazing cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus associated with diarrhea and high mortality in piglets. To gain insight into the evolution and adaptation of TGEV, a comprehensive analysis of phylogeny and codon usage bias was performed. The phylogenetic analyses of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference displayed two distinct genotypes: genotypes I and II, and genotype I was classified into subtypes Ia and Ib. The compositional properties revealed that the coding sequence contained a higher number of A/U nucleotides than G/C nucleotides, and that the synonymous codon third position was A/U-enriched. The principal component analysis based on the values of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) showed the genotype-specific codon usage patterns. The effective number of codons (ENC) indicated moderate codon usage bias in the TGEV genome. Dinucleotide analysis showed that CpA and UpG were over-represented and CpG was under-represented in the coding sequence of the TGEV genome. The analyses of Parity Rule 2 plot, ENC-plot, and neutrality plot displayed that natural selection was the dominant evolutionary driving force in shaping codon usage preference in genotypes Ia and II. In addition, natural selection played a major role, while mutation pressure had a minor role in driving the codon usage bias in genotype Ib. The codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index (SiD) analyses suggested that genotype I might be more adaptive to pigs than genotype II.

They carry higher complication rates compared to handsewn techniques. In human surgery various causes likely to lead to failure of stapled techniques have been evaluated, including staple line failure. Recently Freeman proposed a technique to perform a stapled jejunocecal anastomosis in horses while avoiding blind pouch formation. The aim of this study is to describe a method for stapled side-to-side jejunocecal anastomosis in horses and to compare it with other techniques with computed tomography to assess stomal area, shape and blind pouch size. METHODS Intestinal specimens comprising the cecum, ileum and jejunum from 18 horses were collected and were divided into three groups. In Group S a standard stapled side-to-side jejunocecal anastomosis was performed. In Group F the anastomosis was performed using a modified technique proposed by Freeman. In Group G the anastomosis was performed with a modified technique proposed by the authors. Inflated bowel segments were CT scanned to obtain a MultiPlanar Reconstruction of the stoma and afferent small intestine before calculating the cross-sectional area of each of these regions. The ratio of the measured areas was compared between the three techniques. The volume of the blind-end pouch was measured and its ratio with the intestinal area compared between techniques. The cecum was opened and the length of the stoma measured with a caliper and compared to the intended initial length. RESULTS The stomal/intestinal area ratio was not significantly different between techniques. CONCLUSIONS Both the Freeman and the new (G) technique were comparable to the standard technique in terms of stomal area, stomal shape and difference in stomal elongation. They consistently produced a smaller blind pouch and allowed easier placement of the staplers.","output":"In vitro description of a new technique for stapled side-to-side jejunocecal anastomosis in horses and CT scan anatomical comparison with other techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Modern clinical care in intensive care units is full of rich data, and machine learning has great potential to support clinical decision-making.

METHODS: We searched papers published in the PubMed database between January 1980 and October 2020. We defined selection criteria to identify papers that focused on machine learningCenabled clinical decision support studies in intensive care units and reviewed the following aspects: research topics, study cohorts, machine learning models, analysis variables, and evaluation metrics. RESULTS: A total of 643 papers were collected, and using our selection criteria, 97 studies were found. Studies were categorized into 4 topicsmonitoring, detection, and diagnosis (13/97, 13.4%), early identification of clinical events (32/97, 33.0%), outcome prediction and prognosis assessment (46/97, 47.6%), and treatment decision (6/97, 6.2%). Of the 97 papers, 82 (84.5%) studies used data from adult patients, 9 (9.3%) studies used data from pediatric patients, and 6 (6.2%) studies used data from neonates. We found that 65 (67.0%) studies used data from a single center, and 32 (33.0%) studies used a multicenter data set; 88 (90.7%) studies used supervised learning, 3 (3.1%) studies used unsupervised learning, and 6 (6.2%) studies used reinforcement learning. Clinical variable categories, starting with the most frequently used, were demographic (n=74), laboratory values (n=59), vital signs (n=55), scores (n=48), ventilation parameters (n=43), comorbidities (n=27), medications (n=18), outcome (n=14), fluid balance (n=13), nonmedicine therapy (n=10), symptoms (n=7), and medical history (n=4). The most frequently adopted evaluation metrics for clinical data modeling studies included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (n=61), sensitivity (n=51), specificity (n=41), accuracy (n=29), and positive predictive value (n=23).

The role of telemedicine in patients who undergo frequent on-site treatment, such as radiation therapy, is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine telemedicine use, physician satisfaction, and barriers to continued use in radiation oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An anonymous, electronic survey was distributed to radiation oncologists internationally between June and October 2020. Respondents described demographic and practice characteristics, and a 5-point Likert scale assessed provider satisfaction, ease of use, and overall utility of telemedicine. Analyses include descriptive statistics and subgroup comparisons using the (2) test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The response rate was 4.3%. Two hundred thirty-two respondents completed the survey, 63.8% of whom were male, 52.6% aged 50 or younger, and 78.0% from the United States. Only 14.2% used telemedicine previously, which increased to 93.1% during COVID-19. Among all telemedicine users, usage rates were 77.9% for initial consultations, 97.2% for follow-up visits, and 35.9% for on-treatment visits. Of the respondents, 69.8% reported that <25% of patients requiring treatment experienced delays due to COVID-19. Most conducted appointments from the workplace, with 40.1% also doing so from home. Satisfaction was high at 73.8%, perceived usefulness was 76.9%, and 81.5% hope to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. However, 82.4% had concerns with the inability to examine patients and 63.0% had concerns about poor patient access to the required technology. In addition, 49.5% had concerns regarding continued billing/reimbursement, less commonly at government centers (18.8%) compared with academic/satellite facilities (52.7%) and free-standing centers/community hospitals (50.7%, P = .039 for both comparisons). These concerns were also significantly higher among US physicians (53.2% vs 34.9%, P = .048).

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect nearly all individuals with AD Agitation in AD (Agit-AD) is one of the most common NPS, with an estimated prevalence over 40% Agit-AD is a major cause of distress and burden for AD caregivers and may be driven by disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep In healthy individuals, the circadian clock that generates these rhythms regulates patterns in mood, wakefulness, and other physiologic processes, such as body temperature and hormone levels Individuals with Agit-AD may experience disturbance in their circadian rhythms such that aggressive and disruptive behavior is increased This project aims to examine if agitated AD subjects (AgitAD+) express delayed circadian phases and reduced rhythm strength as compared to non-agitated AD subjects (AgitAD-) and healthy controls Additionally, we seek to 1) evaluate if circadian phase and rhythm strength vary between subtypes of Agit-AD (affective dysregulation vs executive dysfunction);and to 2) compare sleep amount, sleep quality, and degree of sleep disordered breathing among AgitAD+ subjects vs AgitAD- subjects and healthy controls Methods We studied 25 subjects (Table 1): 15 AgitAD+ subjects, 8 AgitAD- subjects, and 2 age-matched healthy controls (HC) Participants completed wrist actigraphy for one week to quantify rest/activity rhythms and sleep;consumed an ingestible, disposable temperature sensor for 1-2 days to quantify core body temperature, a marker of the endogenous circadian rhythm;and completed a single night of home sleep testing (HST;Table 2) Inclusion

Agitation or Aggression subtotals  4 Disease progression was measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and subjects underwent a physical and neurological exam Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Animal Naming (AN), and the Trail-Making Test (parts A & B) Sleep questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) Caregivers were asked to complete a sleep diary for subjects and an agitation log over the week they completed actigraphy Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented hybrid visits with telemedicine to limit in-person interactions Results 25 subjects have completed the study to date There were no statistically significant differences observed in actigraphy-derived sleep parameters between agitated and non-agitated AD subjects (2-group t-test);see Table 1) However, significant differences between the groups have been observed in the rest/activity rhythms: compared to subjects without agitation (AgitAD-), AgitAD+ subjects had lower levels of activity in the morning and greater activity in the afternoon and evening (Figure 1) We also have performed function-on-scalar regression (FOSR) (Goldsmith et al , 2015, Biometrics 71:344-353) using subject-specific activity profiles as outcomes and age and agitation/control status as predictors Figure 2 shows functional effects of age on rest/activity rhythm (left panel) and the functional effect of agitation status (right panel);the red background shows times of day during which there were statistically significant differences, using the pointwise method of analysis (p&lt;0 05) After adjustment for age, agitation was associated with lower activity in the morning period and a trend towards greater activity in the afternoon and evening period (not statistically significant) This preliminary finding may suggest that AgitAD+ subjects express lower and delayed activity rhythms Additionally, the HST results show a trend toward less REM sleep and longer initial REM latency in the AgitAD+ group (Table 2) Updated results will be presented at AAGP (estimated 6-10 additional subjects) Conclusions The collection of multimodal noninvasive data on sleep, activity, and core body temperature is feasible in agitated AD outpatients This study could provide evidence for CRD/sleep disturbance as a driver of Agit-AD and could identify Agit-AD subtypes who are most likely to benefit from chronobiotic or sleep interventions for Agit-AD Furthermore, this study could provide evidence for the use of actigraphy as a surrogate biomarker in proof-of-concept

It is associated with neutropaenia and neutrophil dysfunction, which has recently been attributed to the accumulation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5AG6P) within neutrophils. Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, is a novel therapy that reduces 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) in plasma. RESULTS: We report our experience in treating 8 paediatric GSD Ib patients with empagliflozin with a cumulative treatment time greater than 12 years. Treatment with a median dose of 5 mg (0.22 mg/kg height weight) of empagliflozin resulted in improvement in bowel health, growth, and laboratory parameters. Plasma 1,5AG levels reduced by a median of 78%. Baseline 1,5AG levels in our cohort were higher than in adult patients with GSD Ib. Hypoglycaemia on empagliflozin treatment occurred in 50% of our cohort. CONCLUSION: We report the largest single centre cohort of GSD Ib patients treated with empagliflozin to date. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is a novel and favourable treatment option for neutropaenia and neutrophil dysfunction in GSD Ib. We suggest a low starting dose of empagliflozin with careful titration due to the risk of hypoglycaemia. The interpretation of 1,5AG levels and their role in treatment monitoring is yet to be established, and requires ongoing research.","output":"Understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in glycogen storage disease type Ib: the experience of one UK centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, subsequently named SARS-CoV2) emerged worldwide since December, 2019.

For the clinical type, 1.63% (4/245) patients were mild type, 84.90% (208/245) were moderate type, 7.76% (19/245) were severe type, 5.31% (13/245) were critical type and only 0.41% (1/245) was asymptomatic. 3. Of the 245 patients, 116 (47.35%) were input case, 114 (46.53%) were non-input case, and 15 (6.12%) were unknown exposure. 4. 48.57% (119/245) cases were family cluster, involving 42 families. The most common pattern of COVID-19 family cluster was between husband and wife or between parents and children.","output":"Quarantine at home may not enough!-from the epidemiological data in Shaanxi Province of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disability in Parkinsons disease (PD) is measured by standardised scales including the MDS-UPDRS, which are subject to high inter and intra-rater variability and fail to capture subtle motor impairment. The BRadykinesia Akinesia INcoordination (BRAIN) test is a validated keyboard tapping test, evaluating proximal upper-limb motor impairment. Here, a new Distal Finger Tapping (DFT) test was developed to assess distal upper-limb function. Kinetic parameters of the test include kinesia score (KS20, key taps over 20 s), akinesia time (AT20, mean dwell-time on each key) and incoordination score (IS20, variance of travelling time between key taps). To develop and evaluate a new keyboard-tapping test for objective and remote distal motor function in PD patients. The DFT and BRAIN tests were assessed in 55 PD patients and 65 controls. Test scores were compared between groups and correlated with the MDS-UPDRS-III finger tapping sub-scores. Nine additional PD patients were recruited for monitoring motor fluctuations. All three parameters discriminated effectively between PD patients and controls, with KS20 performing best, yielding 79% sensitivity for 85% specificity; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.90. A combination of DFT and BRAIN tests improved discrimination (AUC = 0.95). Among three parameters, KS20 showed a moderate correlation with the MDS-UPDRS finger-tapping sub-score (Pearsons r = ? 0.40, p = 0.002). Further, the DFT test detected subtle changes in motor fluctuation states which were not reflected clearly by the MDS-UPDRS-III finger tapping sub-scores. The DFT test is an online tool for assessing distal movements in PD, with future scope for longitudinal monitoring of motor complications.","output":"Developing and assessing a new web-based tapping test for measuring distal movement in Parkinsons disease: a Distal Finger Tapping test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunohistochemistry for Uroplakin (UP) II and III is used to determine urothelial origin of carcinomas of unknown primary site and are especially valuable to differentiate urothelial carcinomas (UCs) from lung squamous cell carcinomas and prostate carcinomas.

Primary antibodies (Abs) against UPII were most successful with a pass rate of 86%. No Abs against UPIII provided sufficient staining results. A comparative study was carried out on a larger cohort of tissue samples with optimized methods for the UPII mouse monoclonal antibody (mmAb) clone BC21, UPIII mmAb clone AU-1, and rabbit monoclonal antibody (rmAb) clone SP73 to evaluate the performance in a standardized way. Tissue microarrays containing 58 UCs, 111 non-UCs, and 20 normal tissues were included. The UP stains were evaluated by using H-score. Based on H-scores, samples were categorized as high-expressor (150 to 300), moderate-expressor (10 to 149), low-expressor (1 to 9), and negative (<1). The UPII mmAb clone BC21 obtained a significant higher analytical sensitivity of 69% for UCs compared with the UPIII Abs mmAb clone AU-1 and rmAb clone SP73 with 19% and 29%, respectively. No high-expressor UCs were seen for the UPIII Abs, whereas 13% of the positive UCs obtained an H-score >150 for the UPII Ab.

We empirically examined the impact of COVID-19 on the services trade using quarterly data from 146 countries in 2019 and 2020. Its severity is measured according to the number of cases, the number of deaths, and an index measuring the severity of lockdown orders. We found that the pandemic had a more significantly negative impact on the services trade than the goods trade, particularly on the import side. Moreover, the extent of the impact varied among disaggregated services sectors, reflecting the nature of services. Travel services were the most severely affected, followed by transport and construction services, which are largely related to the international movement of people and goods.

METHOD: An online survey, generated through Facebook, collected self-report data relating to alcohol consumption from 761 Dutch alcohol consumers aged 18C94 years (61.6% female). RESULTS: Overall, young individuals consumed more alcohol than older drinkers, and men more than women. Significant interactions between age group and sex were found for both subjective intoxication and hangover severity, indicating that the sex differences in these variables were greatest in the younger age groups but became significantly smaller or absent in the older age groups. Partial correlations, correcting for estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC), revealed significant and negative partial correlations between age and subjective intoxication (r = ?0.444, P < 0.0001), age and hangover severity (r = ?0.327, P < 0.0001) and between age and hangover frequency (r = ?0.195, P < 0.0001), i.e. subjective intoxication, hangover severity and hangover frequency decline with age. With regard to sex differences, the observed correlations with age for the past month heaviest drinking occasion were stronger in men for subjective intoxication, (z = ?2.25, P = 0.024), hangover severity (z = ?3.36, P = 0.0008) and hangover frequency (z = ?3.63, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Hangover severity declines with age, even after controlling for eBAC or the amount of alcohol consumed.

RESULTS: The students with hearing loss are frustrated with their disability and particularly vulnerable to stress symptoms, but they are highly endurable in mitigating this negative impact on coping with their well-being and responsibilities. They are also more resilient psychologically but less resistant mentally to the pandemic impacts than the students with normal hearing. Their mental and psychological response to the pandemic is associated with more related factors and variables than that of the students with normal hearing is.

Patients with hematologic malignancies may have worse COVID-19 outcomes, due to an impaired humoral immune response from their underlying malignancy and concurrent anticancer therapy. In this multi-center, retrospective, observational study, we evaluate the associations of COVID-19 outcomes with patient and lymphoma disease characteristics. Methods: EMRs at 10 study centers across the USA identified 519 patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma, CLL, or other lymphoid malignancies, who had a documented positive result of SARS-CoV-2 PCR or nucleocapsid antibody testing. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations of individual characteristics with COVID-19 outcomes, adjusted for center (NYU vs. other). The interactions between each of the variables was also included in these models; since the interactions were generally small and non-significant, only the main effect of center was included. Two-sided p-values 0.05 were considered significant; there were no adjustments for multiple variables or endpoints. Each analysis was based on complete data for that analysis. Results: Tables 1 and 2 provide demographic and clinical characteristics, respectively, of the 519 patients. The mean age was 61.9 years, with 296 (57%) male and 374 (72%) white patients. NYU had the largest cohort (318 patients), with the remaining centers contributing a range of 3 to 69 patients (median 14). Logistic regression models for the association of each COVID-19 outcome with individual clinical and patient characteristics included adjustments for the center (NYU/other). While center effects were statistically significant, center by covariate interaction effects were not and are not included in the final models. The odds ratio (OR) estimates and p-values for each patient and CLL/lymphoma clinical variable are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The risks of experiencing a severe event, death, and hospital admission increased with age; for each 10 years of age increase, the ORs were 1.58 for experiencing severe events, 1.78 for death, and 1.65 for hospital admission. The risks of poor outcome were higher in males than in females (OR 1.93 for severe events, 1.85 for death, and 1.47 for hospital admission). Patients with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) >5 had a higher risk of severe events (OR 2.46), mortality (3.30) and hospital admission (2.73) compared to patients with CCI 5. Compared to patients with HL, patients with aggressive NHL had a higher risk of severe events (OR 4.05), mortality (4.68) and hospital admission (4.65). Patients with CLL similarly had a higher risk of severe events (OR 4.64), mortality (4.65) and hospital admission (5.93) compared to HL patients. Patients with indolent NHL had a higher risk of hospital admission (OR 3.95) but not a higher risk of mortality compared to HL. Patients in remission at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis had a lower risk of severe events (OR 0.42), mortality (0.36) and hospital admission (0.40) relative to those who were not in remission. Patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 28 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis had a higher risk of severe events (OR 2.54), mortality (2.79), and hospital admission (2.31). Patients who received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis had a higher risk of severe events (OR 2.60), mortality (2.17) and hospital admission (3.28). Conclusions: In addition to demographic and comorbidity risk factors identified in previous studies, our study shows that patients with aggressive NHL and CLL, or patients who have received recent cytotoxic chemotherapy or anti-CD20 mAB, may be at risk for poor COVID-19 outcome. The difference in risk between NHL and HL patients is likely associated with young age of HL patients but may also be related to differences in underlying innate and adaptive immune defects. Patients at high risk for poor outcome should be a priority for studies of monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. If defects in humoral immunity are at the root of poor outcome, this may be compounded by poor response to vaccination. Multivariate analysis of this data will be completed in advance of the meeting.

We aimed to investigate the association between the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status at baseline and subsequent infection in this population. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff (aged <65 years) and residents (aged >65 years) at 100 LTCFs in England between Oct 1, 2020, and Feb 1, 2021. Blood samples were collected between June and November, 2020, at baseline, and 2 and 4 months thereafter and tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done weekly in staff and monthly in residents. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, adjusted for age and sex, and stratified by LTCF. FINDINGS: 682 residents from 86 LCTFs and 1429 staff members from 97 LTCFs met study inclusion criteria. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 (33%) of 682 residents and 408 (29%) of 1429 staff members. 93 (20%) of 456 residents who were antibody-negative at baseline had a PCR-positive test (infection rate 0054 per month at risk) compared with four (2%) of 226 residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (0007 per month at risk). 111 (11%) of 1021 staff members who were antibody-negative at baseline had PCR-positive tests (0042 per month at risk) compared with ten (2%) of 408 staff members who were antibody-positive staff at baseline (0009 per month at risk). The risk of PCR-positive infection was higher for residents who were antibody-negative at baseline than residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (adjusted HR [aHR] 015, 95% CI 005C044, p=00006), and the risk of a PCR-positive infection was also higher for staff who were antibody-negative at baseline compared with staff who were antibody-positive at baseline (aHR 039, 019C082; p=0012). 12 of 14 reinfected participants had available data on symptoms, and 11 of these participants were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. INTERPRETATION: The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid protein was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS: Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS: Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Future research should examine whether restrictions on or information provided to schoolchildren may exacerbate PSUs effects on psychological distress.","output":"The Relationship Between Children's Problematic Internet-related Behaviors and Psychological Distress During the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Malaysia the COVID-19 disease (COVID-19) has continued to escalate since its first detection in late January 2020, despite widespread implementation of control measures. This study aims to determine the knowledge, perception and behaviors with respect to COVID-19 in the midst of the third wave of the infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among staffs and students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). The survey consists of basic sociodemographic information, 22 items on knowledge on COVID-19, 3 items on perceived self-risk, 2 items on preparedness & perceived self-efficacy, 10 items on preventive (own) measures, 9 items assessing unwanted and desirable behaviors during the pandemic. Simple and multiple linear regression were performed to determine the factors associated with knowledge, preventive measures adopted, self-risk perception, preparedness & perceived self-efficacy, and behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 434 responded to the survey of whom the majority (85.1%) had high scores for knowledge (mean score of 18.72 out of 22). A significant positive association was found between knowledge and older age (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.046 (0.022), p = 0.039), those from medical faculty (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.870 (0.420), p = 0.039) and residence in high-risk areas (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.831 (0.295), p = 0.005).

We experienced a nosocomial outbreak and evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in patients undergoing blood purification therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who underwent blood purification therapy at the dialysis center of our hospital from April 2, 2020, to April 29, 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical factors related to COVID-19 for 18 patients who were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, seven were COVID-19 positive, as confirmed by RT-PCR. The median age was 77 years, 22 patients were male (79%), four patients had acute kidney injury (14%), and six patients were bedridden (21%). All infected patients had been admitted to the wards where the nosocomial outbreak had occurred. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being bedridden (odds ratio 13.33, 95% confidence interval 1.05-169.56, p < 0.05) was significantly related to COVID-19 infection. However, the Charlson comorbidity index, receiving dialysis in the same room, and adjacency of the dialysis bed to COVID-19-positive patients before the confirmation of infection did not reveal any significant relationship. CONCLUSION: Bedridden patients admitted to nosocomial infection wards were associated with COVID-19 infection, and transmission within the dialysis center was not observed.

MethodsWe designed a prospective Italian multicentric study to assess humoral and T-cell response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients (n=378) with solid tumors (ST), hematological malignancies (HM), neurological (ND) and immuno-rheumatological diseases (ID). The immunogenicity of primary vaccination schedule and of the booster dose were analyzed. ResultsOverall, patient seroconversion rate after two doses was 62.1%. A significant lower rate was observed in HM (52.4%) and ID (51.9%) patients compared to ST (95.6%) and ND (70.7%); a lower median level of antibodies was detected in HM and ID versus the others (p<0.0001). A similar rate of patients with a positive SARS-CoV2 T-cell response was observed in all disease groups, with a higher level observed in the ND group. The booster dose improved humoral responses in all disease groups, although with a lower response in HM patients, while the T-cell response increased similarly in all groups. In the multivariable logistic model, the independent predictors for seroconversion were disease subgroups, type of therapies and age. Notably, the ongoing treatment known to affect the immune system was associated with the worst humoral response to vaccination (p<0.0001), but had no effects on the T-cell responses. ConclusionsImmunosuppressive treatment more than disease type per se is a risk factor for low humoral response after vaccination. The booster dose can improve both humoral and T-cell response.

We consider the same emission - number of drops, drop size distribution and initial velocity - and we change environmental parameters as temperature and humidity, and we observe strong variation in droplets evaporation or condensation in accordance with their local temperature and humidity microenvironment. We assume that 3% of the initial droplet volume is made of non-volatile matter. Our systematic analysis confirms that droplets lifetime is always about one order of magnitude larger compared to previous predictions, in some cases up to 200 times.

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. Methods and Findings: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0=2.5, generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the \\"test\\" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","output":"Maximizing and evaluating the impact of test-trace-isolate programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective communication between members of the multidisciplinary team is imperative for patient safety. Within the Medicine for the Elderly wards at Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Dundee, we identified an inefficient process of information-sharing between the orthopaedics outpatient department (OPD) at the main teaching hospital and our hospitals rehabilitation teams, and sought to improve this by introducing several changes to the work system. Our aim was for all patients who attended the OPD clinic to have a plan communicated to the RVH team within 24 hours. Before our intervention, clinic letters containing important instructions for ongoing rehabilitation were dictated by the OPD team, transcribed and uploaded to an electronic system before the RVH team could access them. We analysed clinic attendances over a 4-week period and found that it took 15 days on average for letters to be shared with the RVH teams. We worked with both teams to develop a clinical communication tool and new processes, aiming to expedite the sharing of key information. Patients attended the OPD with this form, the clinician completed it at the time of their appointment and the form returned with the patient to RVH on the same day. We completed multiple PlanCDoCStudyCAct cycles; before our project was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. During our study period, seven patients attended the OPD with a form, with all seven returning to RVH with a completed treatment plan documented by the OPD clinician. This allowed rehabilitation teams to have access to clinic instructions generated by orthopaedic surgeons almost immediately after a patient attended the clinic, essentially eliminating the delay in information-sharing.

Respiratory decline in patients with COVID-19 is precipitated by a lung-mediated aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose lung radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes for select patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A single-institution trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is being performed for the first time. This report describes outcomes of a planned day 7 interim analysis. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidation, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. RESULTS: Of 9 patients screened, 5 were treated with whole-lung radiation on April 24 until April 28 2020, and they were followed for a minimum of 7 days. The median age was 90 years (range, 64-94 years), and 4 were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, 3 patients (60%) were weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, 4 (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) was weaned from oxygen at hour 96. The mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot trial of 5 oxygen-dependent elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvements in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic consolidation without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation appears to be safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study. LAY SUMMARY: Researchers at Emory University report preliminary safety outcomes for patients treated with low-dose lung irradiation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Five residents of nursing or group homes were hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19. Each had pneumonia visible on a chest x-ray, required supplemental oxygen, and experienced a clinical decline in mental status or in work of breathing or a prolonged or escalating supplemental oxygen requirement. A single treatment of low-dose (1.5-Gy) radiation to both lungs was delivered over the course of 10 to 15 minutes. There was no acute toxicity attributable to radiation therapy. Within 24 hours, 4 patients had rapidly improved breathing, and they recovered to room air at an average of 1.5 days (range, 3-96 hours). Three were discharged at a mean time of 12 days, and 1 was preparing for discharge. Blood tests and repeat imaging confirm that low-dose whole-lung radiation treatment appears safe for COVID-19 pneumonia.

On the one hand, physiological activation of this intracellular protein complex is crucial to maintaining normal hematopoiesis and the trafficking of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). On the other hand, its hyperactivation may lead to cell death by pyroptosis, and prolonged activity is associated with sterile inflammation of the BM and, as a consequence, with the HSPCs aging and origination of myelodysplasia and leukemia. Thus, we need to understand better this protein complexs actions to define the boundaries of its safety window and study the transition from being beneficial to being detrimental. As demonstrated, the Nlrp3 inflammasome is expressed and active both in HSPCs and in the non-hematopoietic cells that are constituents of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Importantly, the Nlrp3 inflammasome responds to mediators of purinergic signaling, and while extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) activates this protein complex, its metabolite extracellular adenosine (eAdo) has the opposite effect. In this review, we will discuss and focus on the physiological consequences of the balance between eATP and eAdo in regulating the trafficking of HSPCs in an Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent manner, as seen during pharmacological mobilization from BM into peripheral blood (PB) and in the reverse mechanism of homing from PB to BM and engraftment. We propose that both mediators of purinergic signaling and the Nlrp3 inflammasome itself may become important therapeutic targets in optimizing the trafficking of HSPCs in clinical settings.","output":"Extracellular Adenosine Triphosphate (eATP) and Its Metabolite, Extracellular Adenosine (eAdo), as Opposing YinCYang Regulators of Nlrp3 Inflammasome in the Trafficking of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing procedures have caused disruptions to daily activities.

Since meaning is often related to mental health, these restrictions were likely to decrease mental health. The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96 U.S.A. residents (M age = 34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (n = 45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (n = 51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week.

The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word \\"Coronavirus\\" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","output":"Conversations and Medical News Frames on Twitter: Infodemiological Study on COVID-19 in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called\\"flatten-the-curve\\". There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing the spread of COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 mitigation strategies and overview on results from relevant studies in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) frameworks and methods are becoming embedded in the health informatics community. There is now broad recognition that health informatics tools must account for the diverse needs, characteristics, and abilities of end users, as well as their context of use. The objective of this review is to synthesize the current nature and scope of HF/E integration into the health informatics community. Methods: Because the focus of this synthesis is on understanding the current integration of the HF/E and health informatics research communities, we manually reviewed all manuscripts published in primary HF/E and health informatics journals during 2020. Results: HF/E-focused health informatics studies included in this synthesis focused heavily on EHR customizations, specifically clinical decision support customizations and customized data displays, and on mobile health innovations. While HF/E methods aimed to jointly improve end user safety, performance, and satisfaction, most HF/E-focused health informatics studies measured only end user satisfaction. Conclusion: HF/E-focused health informatics researchers need to identify and communicate methodological standards specific to health informatics, to better synthesize findings across resource intensive HF/E-focused health informatics studies. Important gaps in the HF/E design and evaluation process should be addressed in future work, including support for technology development platforms and training programs so that health informatics designers are as diverse as end users.","output":"Human Factors and Organizational Issues in Health Informatics: Innovations and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of NiAl-Cr-Mo systems were produced and assessed as far as their microstructure and their sliding wear resistance is concerned.

The extent and the nature of all these microstructural features was proved to be affected by the Cr/Mo relative ratio, and an attempt was conducted in order to explain the microstructural features based on solidification and other related phenomena. It was observed that the increase of the relative Mo/Cr ratio led to a significant restriction/elimination of the eutectic microconstituent. The sliding wear response of the produced system seems to diverge from the classical sliding wear laws of Archard and is based on multiple factors such as the nature of the oxide phases being formed upon sliding, the nature and the extend of the intermetallic phases being formed upon solidification, and the integrity and rigidity of the primary phases-last to solidify areas interfacial region and the factors that may influence this integrity.","output":"NiAl-Cr-Mo Medium Entropy Alloys: Microstructural Verification, Solidification Considerations, and Sliding Wear Response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health professionals knowledge and awareness of the disease surveillance is essential for reporting diseases to health departments.

Approximately 692 patients with acute proximal DVT involving the femoral, common femoral, and/or iliac vein are being randomized to receive PCDT + standard therapy versus standard therapy alone. The primary study hypothesis is that PCDT will reduce the proportion of patients who develop PTS within 2 years by one-third, assessed using the Villalta Scale. Secondary outcomes include safety, general and venous disease-specific quality of life, relief of early pain and swelling, and cost-effectiveness.

Along with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new and old cardiovascular injuries are important causes of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing long-term complications. Oxytocin (OXT), an immune-regulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance. It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates T-lymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID-19. Additionally, OXT can promote ?3-interferon expression to inhibit cathepsin L and increases superoxide dismutase expression to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation. Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures. Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension and brain-heart syndrome, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes. Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the side-effects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid. Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID-19. This article summarizes our current understandings of cardiovascular pathogenesis caused by COVID-19, explores the protective potentials of OXT against COVID-19-associated cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in applying OXT in treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

In inflammatory conditions, monocytes frequently show increased expression of CD169/Siglec-1, a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-regulated protein. However, little is known about the phenotype and function of these CD169(+) monocytes. Here, we have investigated the phenotype of human CD169(+) monocytes in different diseases, their capacity to activate CD8(+) T cells, and the potential for a targeted-vaccination approach. Using spectral flow cytometry, we detected CD169 expression by CD14(+) CD16(-) classical and CD14(+) CD16(+) intermediate monocytes and unbiased analysis showed that they were distinct from dendritic cells, including the recently described CD14-expressing DC3. CD169(+) monocytes expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory and HLA molecules, suggesting an increased activation state. IFN treatment highly upregulated CD169 expression on CD14(+) monocytes and boosted their capacity to cross-present antigen to CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, we observed CD169(+) monocytes in virally-infected patients, including in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients, as well as in the blood of patients with different types of cancers. Finally, we evaluated two CD169-targeting nanovaccine platforms, antibody-based and liposome-based, and we showed that CD169(+) monocytes efficiently presented tumor-associated peptides gp100 and WT1 to antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that CD169(+) monocytes are activated monocytes with enhanced CD8(+) T cell stimulatory capacity and that they emerge as an interesting target in nanovaccine strategies, because of their presence in health and different diseases.","output":"CD169 Defines Activated CD14(+) Monocytes With Enhanced CD8(+) T Cell Activation Capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reporter-expressing recombinant virus represents an excellent option and a powerful tool to investigate, among others, viral infection, pathogenicity, and transmission, as well as to identify therapeutic compounds that inhibit viral infection and prophylactic vaccines.

In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in western Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods: The study included data from 500 SARSCoV-2-positive patients who were referred to the hospital. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using RT-PCR. Data including demographic information, comorbidities, ABO blood group, Rh factor, clinical severity as well as the need for assisted ventilation, ICU admission and plasma therapy were collected from patients medical records. The Pearsons correlation, chi square and Fischer exact tests were used to analyze data at significance of 0.05. Results: Frequency of COVID-19 was highest in blood group B (34.8%) and lowest in blood group AB (11.2%). Furthermore, patients with blood group A had significantly more severe form of COVID-19 when compared to patients with other blood groups. The frequency of ICU admission, assisted ventilation and plasma therapy was significantly higher in patients with blood group A than in patients with other blood groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with blood group A are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection that may require assisted ventilation and ICU admission. Hence, these patients might require more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment measures. Further studies are required to validate these findings.

Here, we report the long-term results of LSGs in comparison to those of gastric bypass surgeries. METHODS A prospectively collected bariatric database from Ming-Shen General Hospital was retrospectively studied. Five hundred nineteen morbidly obese patients (mean age 36.0  9.1 years old (14-71), 74.6 % female, mean body mass index (BMI) 37.5  6.1 kg/m(2)) underwent LSG as a primary bariatric procedure from 2006 to 2012 at our institute. The operative parameters, weight loss, laboratory data, and quality of life were followed. Another two matched groups of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic single anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass (SAGB) patients who were matched in terms of age, sex, and BMI were recruited for comparisons. RESULTS The mean surgical time for LSG was 113.5  31.3 min, and the mean blood loss was 49.1 + 100.9 ml. The rate of major complications was 1.6 %, and the average length of the postoperative stay was 3.0  1.7 days. The operation times of the RYGB patients were longer than those of both the LSG and SAGB patients. The RYGB and SAGB patients experienced higher major complication rate than the LSG patients. The weight loss of the LSG patient at 5 years was 28.3 + 8.9 %, and the mean BMI was 27.1 + 4.3. The RYGB patients exhibited a 5-year weight loss similar to the LSG patients, and the SAGB patients exhibited greater weight loss than both of the other groups. Both the RYGB and SAGB patients exhibited significantly better glycemic control and lower blood lipids than the LSG patients, but the LSG patients exhibited a lesser micronutrient deficiency than the RYGB and SAGB groups. All three of the groups exhibited improved quality of life at 5 years after surgery, and there was no significant between-group difference in this measure.

ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the Logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient=0.346, ORa??=a??1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient=0.235, ORa??=a??1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= -0.206,ORa??=a??0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient=0.137, ORa??=a??1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) (coefficient= -0.101, ORa??=a??0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient= -0.043, ORa??=a??0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heartrate, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO2, T, ALB and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively.

With an estimated incidence of 2/100,000 children, MIS-C is relatively rare, but can be fatal. Clinical features can include fever, hyperinflammatory state, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and shock. The pathogenesis of MIS-C, although yet to be completely elucidated, appears to be distinct from KD in terms of epidemiology, severity, and biochemical signature. METHODS: This comprehensive review searched AMED, EBM Reviews, Embase, Healthstar, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Cochrane for studies that reported treatments and outcomes of MIS-C. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 42 papers, from which 15 underwent full-text review (n = 386). A majority of children received intravenous immunoglobulin (77%) and some form of anticoagulation (63%). Steroid use was also common (44%), with immunotherapy used only in severe cases (n = 72). Outcomes reported included PICU admission (77%), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5%), and mortality (1.3%). Although efficacy of treatments for MIS-C have largely not yet been investigated, we propose close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, symptomatic treatment (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin for KD-like symptoms, steroids/immunotherapy for multisystem inflammation), and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Although outcomes are largely favorable, management is based on a different disease entity (KD), which may not be appropriate given the likely pathophysiologic divergences. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of current MIS-C treatments and to determine more refined therapies.","output":"Management of COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A comprehensive literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and spread throughout the world over a short period of time causing a pandemic of a respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The scarce available data indicate that dental healthcare personnel are at increased risk for acquisition of infection. Following the lockdown lifting, dental schools should be prepared to refunction safely and provide essential educational and healthcare services while protecting their students, patients, and personnel. The generation of aerosols in dental practice, in association with the high-transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol-generation procedures, the simultaneous provision of dental services to patients in the same areas, and the fact that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected persons may transmit the virus, render the implementation of specific infection prevention and control measures imperative for dental schools.

In Latin America, COVID19 had its first case in the megacity of S?o Paulo, Brazil, thus being the starting point and epicenter of this disease. In this context, prostate cancer (PC) is the most common nonskin cancer among men and its preventive healthcare is substantial to public health surveillance. Additionally, PC raises particular interest during COVID-19 outbreak as PC androgen-deprivation therapies have shown to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggests an association between SARS-CoV-2 and PC cells. Thus, the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on male genital cancers care remain inconclusive and will probably be felt for decades. This study aimed to determine the impact of pandemic on the incidence of hospital admissions (HA) due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs in the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of the HAs due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs in the city of S?o Paulo comparing the outbreak period (January-June 2020) and a pre-pandemic corresponding period of the years 2017-2019. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Unified Health System - Hospital Information System database according to the chapter II of the International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD10). Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the incidence of HAs and time (months). Results: A significant reduction in HAs due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs was observed in PC, but not other malignant neoplasms of male genital organs during the outbreak period (JanuaryJune 2020). PC (-19, CI -36 to -1) showed to be remarkably affected while other male genital cancers (-1, CI -5 to 3) did not (Table). Conclusions: Our findings seem to be associated to delayed oncological care delivery to PC during the lockdown and health system disruption. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of the ongoing pandemic in malignant neoplasm of male genital organs, particularly PC, in order to strategically corroborate public health actions for implications of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Reduction in prostate cancer hospitalizations in the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter of Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jordan is considered a low middle-income country with a population of 9.956 million in 2018.

The healthcare sector is divided into two main sectors; the public and the private sector with both including hospitals, primary care clinics and pharmacies. The Jordanian government has a strong commitment to health and educational programs; hence, an increase in the number of pharmacy schools and pharmacy graduates has occurred in the past few years. Health authorities, such as the Jordan Food and Drug Association (JFDA) and the Jordan Pharmaceutical Association (JPA) have played an important role in ensuring the availability and affordability of medications, and has influenced the practice of pharmacists.

Lithuania is a country situated on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Until January 15, Lithuania had 165560 confirmed positive cases, 100495 recoveries, and 2376 deaths. METHOD: In this abstract, we describe reorganization in dialysis service in Vilnius, the capital and largest city of Lithuania, with urban population of 700,275 inhabitants. RESULTS: At the pandemic start in March 2020, Vilnius had 3 public nephrology departments each running a hemodialysis unit, and 4 private hemodialysis centers, with total of 250 end-stage kidney disease patients. Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, as the main hospital in the country and national CoVid-19 coordinator, restructured dialysis service in city area. Chronic hemodialysis programs in public hospitals were cancelled and patients were shifted to private centers. In the threat of infection and multiple outbreaks in two hospitals, nephrology units were closed and CoVid-19 negative nephrology patients were located in a satellite hospital in other city, whilst all city hospitals served as CoVid-19 centers. In Santaros Klinikos, we treated severe CoVid-19 patients who needed chronic or acute dialysis, while asymptomatic and mild to moderate-symptom patients carried their dialysis procedures in isolated shafts and/or facilities in private centers. In cases with unsatisfactory self-isolation, isolation sites were located in hotels or other premises provided by the municipal administration. Transportation to dialysis center was provided by municipality as well. Rapid antigen testing was set in a case of suspected outbreak or for all outpatient hemodialysis patients in some centers in circumstances of high community transmission. During the pandemic, we had ongoing transplant activities, continued wait-listing for kidney transplant and increased peritoneal dialysis program. Most peritoneal dialysis patients were trained at home by a mobile nurse team, also home visits we carried instead of inpatients visits. We started CoVid-19 vaccination during the first week of January for all dialysis patients and transplant recipients who had no contraindications and gave informed consent. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the rapid release and adoption of recommendations and action plan helped to identify and locate CoVid-19 outbreaks in dialysis facilities. Dialysis service reorganization is needed to maintain ongoing treatment for chronic patients who vitally depend on renal replacement therapy. Private dialysis centers and municipality should assist with physical resources operating the patients flow. The growth of peritoneal dialysis program serves as a significant subsidiary factor when patients need more social distancing.

We find that both empirical expectations (what others do) and normative expectations (what others approve of) play a significant role in compliance, beyond the effect of any other individual or group characteristic. In our survey experiment, when empirical and normative expectations of individuals are high, compliance goes up by 55% (relative to the low expectations condition). Similar results are obtained when we look at self-reported compliance among those with high expectations. Our results are driven by an asymmetric interaction with individuals trust in government and science. Holding both expectations high, the effect of trusting science is substantial and significant in our vignette experiment (22% increase in compliance), and even larger in self-reported compliance (76% and 127% increase before and after the lockdown). By contrast, trusting the government only generates modest effects.

It is unclear if and how prestress neurocognitive factors moderate risk for anxiety during high-stress situations. Enhanced error monitoring and a cognitive control strategy of more instantaneous (reactive) control have both been independently related to anxiety. We examined if a specific neurocognitive profile characterized by heightened error monitoring and a more reactive cognitive control strategy in adolescence predicts young adults anxiety trajectories across 3 early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study (N = 291), data were acquired in adolescence (13 years) on error monitoring (n = 124) and cognitive control strategy (n = 119). In young adulthood (18 years), anxiety was assessed three times during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 162). RESULTS: On average, participants experienced greater anxiety in the first COVID-19 pandemic assessment, then anxiety decreased in the following months. Error monitoring and cognitive control strategy interacted to predict anxiety trajectories, such that among adolescents with an increased reliance on reactive control, error monitoring predicted greater anxiety in the first assessment but greater decreases the following months as stay-at-home orders were lifted and families adapted to the restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that neurocognitive profiles in adolescence predict young adults anxiety responses during a highly stressful period, such as the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The yeast-derived BG has been recognized for its potent biological activity and it is used as an immunomodulator in human and veterinary medicine. The goal of the current study was to characterize the immunostimulatory activity of soluble yeast BG in primary cultures of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) head kidney leukocytes (HKLs) in which phagocytic cell types including neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes predominate. The effect of BG on the secretome of HKL cultures, including secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and soluble protein55s was characterized through western blotting and mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate that, along with upregulation of proinflammatory genes, BG induces secretion of ubiquitinated proteins (UbP), MHCII-containing EVs from professional antigen presenting cells as well as proteins derived from granules of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). Among the most abundant proteins identified in BG-induced EVs were beta-2 integrin subunits, including CD18 and CD11 homologs, which highlights the role of salmon granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes in the response to soluble BG.

The viability changes of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to different classes of antibiotics were measured to evaluate the development of cross-resistance. The relative fitness was also estimated to evaluate the reproductive success of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI consecutively exposed to a half and 1 MIC of CEF, CIP, POL, or TET. The expression levels of efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were evaluated by using a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The MIC of CIP against STCIP was increased by 128-fold compared to STWT. STCLI was highly resistant to POL (MIC = 8 g/ml) and TET (MIC = 256 g/ml). STWT exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1] than CEF [1], CIP [1], and TET [1], STCIP exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to CEF [1] and POL [1], and STCLI exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1]. STCIP was cross-resistant to CEF [1/2]-CIP [1], CIP [1/2]-CIP [1], POL [1/2]-CIP [1], and TET [1/2]-CIP (Ochoa et al., 2020) [1]. The efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were overexpressed in STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments, which was related to the development of cross-resistance. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments are worth understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and developing effective therapeutic regimens against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","output":"Assessment of cross-resistance potential to serial antibiotic treatments in antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, potentially fatal yet treatable disease. Several advances in treatment of VTE have been made over the past decades, but definition and reporting of outcomes across those studies are inconsistent. Development of an international core outcome set for clinical studies of interventions for VTE addresses this lack of standardisation. The first step in the development of a core outcome set is to conduct a scoping review which aims to generate an inclusive list of unique outcomes that have been reported in previous studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched with no language restriction for prospective studies reporting on interventions for treatment of VTE in patients who are adult and non-pregnant. Records will be sorted in reverse chronological order. Study screening and data extraction will be independently performed by two authors in blocks based on date of publication, starting with 2015 to 2020 and subsequent 1-year periods, until no new outcome measures are identified from the set of included studies. After homogenising spelling and combining outcomes with the same meaning, a list of unique outcomes will be determined. Those outcomes will be grouped into outcome domains. Qualitative analysis and descriptive statistics will be used to report results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this study. The results of this scoping review will be presented at scientific conferences, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and they will provide candidate outcome domains to be considered in subsequent steps in the development of a core outcome set for clinical studies of interventions for VTE.

Recent studies showing the effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy combine modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 to assess the technical success of endovascular treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine how much clinical outcomes differ between patients achieving modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 222 consecutive patients with acute large intracranial artery occlusion of the anterior circulation having achieved modified TICI 2b or modified TICI 3 reperfusion after thrombectomy. The primary end point was the rate of favorable outcome defined as the achievement of a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS Patients with modified TICI 3 more often had favorable collateral circulation and atherosclerosis etiology, with a shorter time from onset to reperfusion than patients with modified TICI 2b (all P < .05). The number of total passes to achieve reperfusion was higher in the modified TICI 2b group (median, 2; interquartile range, 1-3, 1-9) versus (median, 1; interquartile range, 1-2, 1-8) in the modified TICI 3 group (P = .0002). Favorable outcome was reached more often for patients with modified TICI 3 than for those with modified TICI 2b (71.7% versus 50.5%, P = .001), with a similar difference when considering excellent outcome. In addition, patients with modified TICI 3 had a lower intracerebral hemorrhage rate (23.0% versus 45.0%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with modified TICI 3 reperfusion have better functional outcomes than those with modified TICI 2b. Given the improving reperfusion rates obtained with thrombectomy devices, future thrombectomy trials should consider modified TICI 2b and modified TICI 3 status separately.","output":"Impact of Modified TICI 3 versus Modified TICI 2b Reperfusion Score to Predict Good Outcome following Endovascular Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral PCR testing performed on a skin swab did not detect Herpes simplex virus but identified Coxsackie virus, thus confirming a diagnosis of eczema coxsackium.

We observe that in this context delivery workers provide the necessary resilience to the consumer market, yet owing to lack of risk awareness and low wages they may not have incentives to value and manage safety risks properly. We have therefore investigated public and market regulation for possible remedies for this problem. Our research concludes that delivery risks are currently overlooked in EU road transport regulations. Furthermore, the necessary sector transparency that would allow compliance control is equally missing. We have found that the parcel delivery and on-demand delivery sectors also do not provide any special safety measures. The companies do not go beyond recommendations and guidelines and indicate no compliance controls. Some solutions are offered by mandatory contract law, which could provide retailers and consumers with the tools needed to enforce safe delivery in the contract chain. Nevertheless, since there are no explicit contractual obligations, legal uncertainty remains. Our main recommendation is for greater transparency in B2C delivery chains with new or amended regulations, increased reporting obligations and market regulation.

Characteristic symptoms of itching, irritation, and odor cause considerable discomfort and increase the risk of contracting other sexually transmitted infections. Because of the sensitive and personal nature of the condition, some women may be reluctant to seek treatment. This behavior not only fails to solve the problem but may also delay medical treatment and result in additional medical complications. The pH changes associated with vaginitis and vaginosis, which are characterized by the presence or absence of inflammation, respectively, are well known but can vary. For example, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis infection will raise vaginal pH above 4.5, while vulvovaginal candidiasis does not result in any measurable change to pH. Nonetheless, diagnostic tools relying on pH measurement are a valuable approach from which additional testing and treatment may be launched.

This study aimed to identify factors that influence faculty's rating choicesimmediately following assessment and explore their experiences using WBAs with entrustment anchors, specifically the Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation scale. METHOD A convenience sample of 50 semi-structured interviews with Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians from a single Canadian hospital were conducted between July and August, 2019. All interviews occurred within two hours of faculty completing a WBA of a trainee. Faculty were asked what they considered when rating the trainee's performance and whether they considered an alternate rating. Two team members independently analyzed interview transcripts using conventional content analysis with line-by-line coding to identify themes. RESULTS Interviews captured interactions between 70% (26/37) of full-time EM faculty and 86% (19/22) of EM trainees. Faculty most commonly identified the amount of guidance the trainee required as influencing their rating. Other variables such as clinical context, trainee experience, past experiences with the trainee, perceived competence and confidence were also identified.

We hypothesize that there are six major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes: (1) severity of disease in the local region, including potential subsequent \\"waves\\" of infection; (2) lifting of government social distancing restrictions; (3) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities; (4) management of pent-up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic, including institutional capacity; (5) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging; and (6) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed, including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency, inpatient, outpatient mix and subspecialty types. We encourage radiology practice leaders to use these and other relevant variables to plan for the coming weeks and to work collaboratively with local health system and governmental leaders to help ensure that needed patient care is restored as quickly as the environment will safely permit.","output":"Variables Influencing Radiology Volume Recovery During the Next Phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that delayed cord clamping (DCC) is safe in mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study involving epidemiological information from 403 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 between 1 March and 31 May 2020. Data were collected from 70 centres that participate in the Spanish Registry of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients' information was collected from their medical chart. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and development of the infection in neonates within 14 days postpartum. RESULTS: The early cord clamping (ECC) group consisted of 231 infants (57.3%) and the DCC group consisted of 172 infants (42.7%). Five positive newborns (1.7% of total tests performed) were identified with the nasopharyngeal PCR tests performed in the first 12 hours postpartum, two from the ECC group (1.7%) and three from the DCC group (3.6%). No significant differences between groups were found regarding neonatal tests for SARS-CoV-2. No confirmed cases of vertical transmission were detected. The percentage of mothers who made skin-to-skin contact within the first 24 hours after delivery was significantly higher in the DCC group (84.3% versus 45.9%). Breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period was also significantly higher in the DCC group (77.3% versus 50.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show no differences in perinatal outcomes when performing ECC or DCC, and skin-to-skin contact, or breastfeeding.

In recent years it has also become increasingly apparent that organelle structure dictates function. It is now clear that organelles must maintain precise organization and localization for proper function. Newer microscopy capabilities have allowed the scientific community to reveal, via 3D imaging, that the structure of these organelles and their interactions with each other are a main component of regulating function and, therefore, effects on the disease state.

In this study, we explored the effects of the pandemic and pandemic restrictions on people with SMI during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in a sample of people with SMI. The inception survey was carried out between July and December 2020. Participants were then re-surveyed between January and March 2021. People were contacted by telephone and invited to take part in the study over the phone, online or by postal questionnaire. Across both waves we asked participants about their physical and mental health, health risk behaviors, well-being, loneliness, and employment status. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-seven people with SMI completed the inception survey and 249 people completed the follow up. Whilst some people reported no change in their physical (77, 31%) or mental health (60, 24%) over the course of the pandemic 53 (21%) reported a continuing decline in physical health and 52 (21%) reported a continuing decline in mental health. Participants who maintained a daily routine or reported no decline in physical health were found to be associated with no deterioration in mental health (Daily routine OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.11C4.64; no reported physical health decline OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17C0.70). Participants were less likely to be occupationally active in the first phase of the pandemic compared to before the pandemic and in the second phase of the pandemic. However, there was no one single experience of people with SMI and similar to studies in the general populations a range of different scenarios was experienced. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a series of factors that might amplify pre-existing health inequalities. Health systems should be mindful of this, and should redouble efforts to set in place changes to practice and policy, which can mitigate these inequalities. Examples might include; raising awareness of the importance of ensuring that people with SMI receive an annual physical health check and supporting people to maintain a daily routine.","output":"A Year Into the Pandemic: The Diversity of Experience Amongst People With Severe Mental Ill Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We aimed at exploring the proportion of patients dying with COVID-19 and concomitant dementia in Italy, as well as their clinical characteristics and trajectories of care.

Although measures were taken to restrict hospital visits, traditional paper-based registration is insufficient to screen and monitor the numbers of visitors to a large hospital. METHODS: Throughout March 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, a computer system was deployed in the 2800-bed Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) to register, screen, and monitor inpatient visitors. This system comprised three parts: online registration form, entrance check-in interface, and registration database. The early utilization of this newly deployed system was then analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 22,336 visits were recorded between March 11, 2020, and March 31, 2020, with 1064 a day on average. Out of these visits, 18.1% (n = 4049) had made online reservations within 48 hours. On the other hand, of all 4941 online reservations, 18.1% (n = 892) were no-shows. In the last 12 days of the study period, eight prospective visitors were identified as ineligible by the computer system, and so their visits were denied. CONCLUSION: Using a computer system, the hospital was able to enforce restrictions on hospital visits. Although the online registration system had not been fully used yet in the early phase of adoption, its superiority from the standpoint of disease control should enable hospital managers to consider abolishing on-site visitor registration.","output":"Deployment of a computerized ward visitor registration system in coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic: Experiences of a large academic medical center in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ARG2 has been reported to inhibit autophagy in vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes. However, studies of its mechanism of action, its role in skin fibroblasts, and the possibility of promoting autophagy and inhibiting cellular senescence through ARG2 inhibition are lacking. We induced cellular senescence in dermal fibroblasts by using H(2)O(2). H(2)O(2)-induced fibroblast senescence was inhibited upon ARG2 knockdown and promoted upon ARG2 overexpression. The microRNA miR-1299 suppressed ARG2 expression, thereby inhibiting fibroblast senescence, and miR-1299 inhibitors promoted dermal fibroblast senescence by upregulating ARG2. Using yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that ARG2 binds to ARL1. ARL1 knockdown inhibited autophagy and ARL1 overexpression promoted it. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) suppressed ARG2 expression and cellular senescence. These data indicate that ARG2 stimulates dermal fibroblast cell senescence by inhibiting autophagy after interacting with ARL1. In addition, RvD1 appears to promote autophagy and inhibit dermal fibroblast senescence by inhibiting ARG2 expression. Taken together, the miR-1299/ARG2/ARL1 axis emerges as a novel mechanism of the ARG2-induced inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, these results indicate that miR-1299 and pro-resolving lipids, including RvD1, are likely involved in inhibiting cellular senescence by inducing autophagy.","output":"Resolvin D1 Suppresses H(2)O(2)-Induced Senescence in Fibroblasts by Inducing Autophagy through the miR-1299/ARG2/ARL1 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are usually prescribed for severe cases with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Despite their importance to decrease patients mortality, they can cause serious side effects like fulminant fungal infection that can damage lungs or invade the sinuses then rapidly spread to the orbit and even intra-cranially. Unless early diagnosed and properly managed, patients can lose their vision or die from cavernous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old diabetic male patient presented with dry cough, fever, and dyspnea for 6 days. PCR test for COVID-19 was ordered and declared positive. The oxygen saturation on day 7 started to decline to reach 90%. Eight ampules of intra-muscular dexamethasone were prescribed. The patients dyspnea improved, and the oxygen saturation reached 94% by day 13. Oral prednisone was prescribed in a withdrawal protocol. Unfortunately, on day 15, the patient complained of mild left-sided cheek swelling and noticeably dropped left angle of mouth. Neurological consultation suspected facial palsy and asked for brain MRI examination. Limited lower cuts of the MRI study that covered the left maxillary antrum revealed mild fullness of the pre-maxillary fat planes with mucosal thickening. Complimentary dedicated MRI and CT cuts over the left maxillary sinus showed localized signs of invasive fungal sinusitis without orbital or intracranial complications. The patient received antifungal therapy even before evident endoscopic findings appeared. He underwent endoscopic debridement few days after and he had an excellent outcome without any progression or significant morbidities.

Our study tested 15 reusable cloth masks (which included face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators as source control devices for aerosols  7 m produced during simulated coughing and exhalation. These measurements were compared with the mask filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors. The source control collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation. The filtration efficiencies of the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on an elastomeric manikin headform and 1.0 to 4.0 on human test subjects. The correlation coefficients between the source control efficacies and the other performance metrics ranged from 0.31 to 0.66 and were significant in all but one case. However, none of the alternative metrics were strong predictors of the source control performance of cloth masks. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the relationships between source control performance and metrics like filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor are needed to develop simple methods to estimate the effectiveness of masks as source control devices for respiratory aerosols.","output":"A comparison of performance metrics for cloth face masks as source control devices for simulated cough and exhalation aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract One of the key roles of public health is to manage outbreaks that endanger the health of the population.

Little is known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we report the first confirmed case of early postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient recovering after Hartmanns procedure for acute diverticulitis. After an otherwise unevenful postoperative course, on post-operative day 8, the patient suddenly presented hyperpyrexia and cough, rapidly evolving to respiratory failure and death 36 h after symptoms onset. CT-scan identified bilateral, diffuse, interstitial pneumonitis and oropharyngeal swab test confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A previous contact with the partner, developing the same symptoms, remained unrecognized until ICU admission. DISCUSSION: During a pandemic outbreak, the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an inside patient initially considered to be infection-free has a pivotal importance not only for the prompt patients management, but also to avoid infection spreading to other patients and hospital personnel.In the reported case, a more precise information to the patient regarding the imperative necessity to inform the medical personnel of any person of his entourage presenting, at any time, any tell-tale sign, symptom or examination which may be attributed to COVID-19, may have had allowed to anticipate patients isolation and examinations and procedures aimed at identifying such an infection. CONCLUSION: Persistent hyperleucocytosis and increased CRP serum level in spite of uneventful postoperative course were the only, aspecific markers of an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection before symptoms onset, and should be considered in future clinical practice in order to adopt the prompt and appropriate patient management and limit COVID-19 contagion in surgical units.","output":"Rapidly fatal outcome of Covid-19 after successful emergency surgery during pandemic outbreak in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To compare different pooling methods in an attempt to improve the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic capacities. Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged.","output":"Optimizing the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 PCR testing for low resource and high demand settings: The development of information-dependent pooling protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues infecting humans and dromedary camels. While MERS-CoV strains from the Middle East region are subdivided into two clades (A and B), all the contemporary epidemic viruses belong to clade B. Thus, MERS-CoV clade B strains may display adaptive advantages over clade A in humans and/or reservoir hosts. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we compared an early epidemic clade A strain (EMC/2012) with a clade B strain (Jordan-1/2015) in an alpaca model monitoring virological and immunological parameters. Further, the Jordan-1/2015 strain has a partial amino acid (aa) deletion in the double-stranded (ds) RNA binding motif of the open reading frame ORF4a protein. Animals inoculated with the Jordan-1/2015 variant had higher MERS-CoV replicative capabilities in the respiratory tract and larger nasal viral shedding. In the nasal mucosa, the Jordan-1/2015 strain caused an early IFN response, suggesting a role for ORF4a as a moderate IFN antagonist in vivo. However, both strains elicited maximal transcription of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) at the peak of infection on 2 days post inoculation, correlating with subsequent decreases in tissular viral loads. Genome alignment analysis revealed several clade B-specific amino acid substitutions occurring in the replicase and the S proteins, which could explain a better adaptation of clade B strains in camelid hosts.

The countries that share common history, when they emerged from the same health system and similar conditions in the early 1990s, after the division of Czechoslovakia, became the objects of evaluation of the development of technical efficiency of hospital care. The subsequent development of their health care system also was very similar, but no longer entirely identical. The article aims to identify the trends and disparities in the productivity of the capacities of hospital care on the regional level (NUTS III.) in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2009C2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic using the multi-criteria decision methods. METHODS: The window analysis as a dynamic DEA method based on moving averages and also the Malmquist Index, that allows the evaluation of changes in relative efficiency and of changes in the production possibilities frontier have become the key methods for evaluating the over time efficiency evolution. To model technical efficiency, an output-oriented method assuming constant returns to scale was chosen. Aggregated input and output parameters for each region were the object of study. RESULTS: The results showed that differences in the efficiency trends in terms of the examined parameters among the individual regions are slightly greater in the Czech Republic than in the Slovak Republic. The least efficient regions are those where capital cities are located. Furthermore, the analysis showed that in 2018 all of the Slovak Republic regions improved its productivity compared to 2009 and that technological conditions had a significant impact on this improvement. The results of the Czech Republic regions show productivity improvement in 57% of the regions that, on the contrary, was due to changes in technical efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: It should be recommended to the state- and regional-level governments to refrain from unilaterally preferring the orientation of public policies on the efficiency of the provision of hospital care, and rather focus on increasing the quality and availability of hospital care, especially in smaller, rural, and border regions, in the interest of population safety during pandemics and other emergencies.

We found that on average, in relative terms, men have increased their contributions at roughly the same rate (by 35 percent) as women. But given that women had been doing a lot more childcare work before the pandemic, in absolute terms, womens contributions grew significantly more than mens and the gap between men and women has increased in absolute work hour terms. This was particularly so among a specific group of women: middle class, highly educated city-dwellers. Our data suggest that in Hungary the pandemic increased gender inequality the most among the highest educated.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the gender division of childcare work in Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a number of challenges worldwide regarding not only the human health perspective, but also the economic situation. Quarantine, imposed in many countries, forced a substantial part of businesses to close or narrow down their activities, thus leaving corporations and employees without any or with lower income. If national governments had not undertaken any actions to save national economies, the consequences could have been even more devastating. The real estate market is an important part of economy. Instability in the real estate market can cause financial problems, vulnerability of population's welfare and other negative effects. This research aims to assess the impact of the economic stimulus measures on the real estate market under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania. The research methods include comparative analysis, correlation analysis, stationarity test, regression analysis and the ARDL models. The results indicate that the economic stimulus measures only partially contribute to stabilization of the real estate market in Lithuania. The drop in housing prices was 2.9 percent lower because of the economic stimulus in the second quarter of 2020. Maintenance of household cash and deposits as well as lending to business enterprises are the measures that allow to stabilize the real estate market in the shortest time under the conditions of the economic shock. The other governmental support measures are also important, especially if they are aimed at preserving jobs.","output":"Impact of the Economic Stimulus Measures on Lithuanian Real Estate Market under the Conditions of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: New York City is the US epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Results: Of common comorbid conditions (hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cancer), when adjusted for covariates, chronic kidney disease remained significantly associated with increased odds of mortality. Patients who had more than one comorbidities, former smokers, treated with Azithromycin without Hydroxychloroquine, reside within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens Higher had higher odds of death. Conclusions: Increasing numbers of comorbid factors increase COVID-19 mortality, but several clinical and sociodemographic factors can mitigate risk.

It is expected that the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong will be exhausted by 2020. In consideration of the food waste management environment and community needs in Hong Kong, as well as with reference to the food waste management systems in cities such as Link?ping in Sweden and Oslo in Norway, a framework of food waste separation, collection, and recycling for food waste valorization is proposed in this paper. Food waste can be packed in an optic bag (i.e., a bag in green color), while the residual municipal solid waste (MSW) can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations, in which food waste is separated from the residual MSW using an optic sensor. On the one hand, the sorted food waste can be converted into valuable materials (e.g., compost, swine feed, fish feed). On the other hand, the sorted food waste can be sent to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities and sewage treatment works for producing biogas. The biogas can be recovered to produce electricity and city gas (i.e., heating fuel for cooking purpose). Due to the challenges faced by the value-added products in Hong Kong, the biogas is recommended to be upgraded as a biogas fuel for vehicle use. Hopefully, the proposed framework will provide a simple and effective approach to food waste separation at source and promote sustainable use of waste to resource in Hong Kong.","output":"Food waste collection and recycling for value-added products: potential applications and challenges in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including autoimmune features and autoantibody production. We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50% of patients, but in <15% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in ~25% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed de novo following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME).

The Government of Tamil Nadu, India implemented the double lockdown protocol in the pursuit of restraining the spread of covid ?19. Nevertheless, the protocol leads to unanticipated consequences on the spread of novel coronavirus. The thrust of the study is to demonstrate the unprecedented consequences of double lockdown on the growth rate of covid-19 cases, instead of flattening the curve and subsequently reveal the cobra effect on the containment strategy of covid-19. For this purpose, the study adopted an event study methodology to test the effect of the announcement of double lockdown on the spike rate of new covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu, India. The findings of the longitudinal data analysis revealed a significant increase in covid-19 cases after the government announced a double lockdown. A deeper analysis to determine the factors influencing the abnormal rise in covid ?19 cases (CAR) using regression analysis revealed a significant positive effect on population density and a negative impact on ICCC and HDI. Until now, no empirical research has evaluated the counter-effects of governments protocol in containing a pandemic disease, by adopting an event study approach.

In terms of design, C-Watcher collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn\\"city-invariant\\"representations from the mobility-related features for precise early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases known, in the target city.

Virus particles adsorbed to the precipitate are collected by low-speed centrifugation, after which the recovered pellet is resuspended with a saline buffer. The PAC concentration method produced an average shift of 4.4-units in Cq values compared to non-concentrated samples, indicating a 25-fold increase in detection sensitivity. The lower detection limit corresponded approximately to 100 copies per ml. Kappa index indicated substantial agreement between PAC and PEG precipitation protocols (k=0.688, CI 0.457-0.919). PAC concentrated samples can be processed immediately for RNA purification and qPCR or sent refrigerated to a diagnosis center, where SARS-CoV-2 detection should be performed in the same way as for clinical samples.

Therefore, developing an effective vaccine capable of inducing the strong humoral and cellular immune responses necessary to block the pre-erythrocytic stage has potential to overcome the spatiotemporal hindrances pertaining to parasite biology and hepatic microanatomy. We recently showed that when combined with a human adenovirus type 5 (AdHu5)-priming vaccine, adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) is a potent booster malaria vaccine vector capable of inducing strong and long-lasting protective immune responses in a rodent malaria model. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of a hepatotropic virus, adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8), as a booster vector because it can deliver a transgene potently and rapidly to the liver, the organ malaria sporozoites initially infect and multiply in following sporozoite injection by the bite of an infected mosquito. We first generated an AAV8-vectored vaccine expressing P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of AAV8-PfCSP to mice initially primed with AdHu5-PfCSP resulted in a hepatocyte transduction rate ~2.5 times above that seen with intramuscular (i.m.) administration. This immunization regimen provided a better protection rate (100% sterile protection) than that of the i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.m. AAV8-boost regimen (60%, p < 0.05), i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.v. AAV1-boost (78%), or i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.m. AAV1-boost (80%) against challenge with transgenic PfCSP-expressing P. berghei sporozoites. Compared with the i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.v. AAV1-boost regimen, three other regimens induced higher levels of PfCSP-specific humoral immune responses. Importantly, a single i.v. dose of AAV8-PfCSP recruited CD8(+) T cells, especially resident memory CD8(+) T cells, in the liver. These data suggest that boost with i.v. AAV8-PfCSP can improve humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice. Therefore, this regimen holds great promise as a next-generation platform for the development of an effective malaria vaccine.","output":"Liver-Directed AAV8 Booster Vaccine Expressing Plasmodium falciparum Antigen Following Adenovirus Vaccine Priming Elicits Sterile Protection in a Murine Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cluster of pneumonia (COVID\\\\19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV).

Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors used the Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BEKK-GARCH) model to estimate shock transmission among the five financial markets and the two commodities. The authors rely on Diebold and Yilmaz (2014, 2015) methodology to construct network-associated measures. Findings Relying on the BEKK-GARCH, the authors found that the recent health crisis of COVID-19 intensified the volatility spillovers among stock markets and commodities. Using the dynamic network connectedness, the authors showed that at the 2014 oil price drop and the COVID-19 pandemic shock, the Nikkei225 moderated the transmission of volatility to the majority of markets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the commodity markets are a net receiver of volatility shocks from stock markets. In addition, the SP500 stock market dominates the network connectedness dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic, while DAX index is the weakest risk transmitter.

This is a randomized parallel controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate vaccination interval of the vaccine for high-risk occupational population. METHODS: In an ongoing randomized, parallel, controlled phase IV trial between January and May 2021 in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, China, we randomly assigned the airport ground staff and public security officers aged 18 to 59 years to receive two doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at 14 days, 21 days, or 28 days. The serum neutralizing antibody to live SARS-CoV-2 was performed at baseline and 28 days after immunization. Long-term data are being collected. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were neutralization antibody seroconversion and geometric mean titer (GMT) at 28 days after the second dose. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 809 participants underwent randomization and received two doses of injections: 270, 270, 269 in the 0C14, 0C21, and 0C28 vaccination group, respectively. By day 28 after the second injection, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody of GMT was 98.4 (95% CI: 88.4C108.4) in the 0C14 group, which was significantly lower compared with 134.4 (95% CI: 123.1C145.7) in the 0C21 group (P < 0.001 vs 0C14 group) and 145.5 (95% CI: 131.3C159.6) in the 0C28 group (P < 0.001 vs 0C14 group), resulting in the seroconversion rates to neutralizing antibodies (GMT  16) of 100.0% for all three groups, respectively. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis yielded similar results. All reported adverse reactions were mild. CONCLUSIONS: Both a two-dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at 0C21 days and 0C28 days regimens significantly improved SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody level compared to the 0C14 days regimen in high-risk occupational population, with seroconversion rates of 100.0%.

The estimated TiO(2) mass at the fiber surface ranged from 17 to 4394 g, and systematically exceeded the acceptable exposure level to TiO(2) by inhalation (3.6 g), determined based on a scenario where face masks are worn intensively. No assumptions were made about the likelihood of the release of TiO(2) particles itself, since direct measurement of release and inhalation uptake when face masks are worn could not be assessed. The importance of wearing face masks against COVID-19 is unquestionable.

People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure.

The neurosurgical volume was compared between the 2 periods. RESULTS: A 40% reduction in weekly procedural volume was demonstrated during COVID-19 (median before, 75; interquartile range [IQR], 72-80; median during, 45; IQR, 43-47; P < 0.001). A 42% reduction occurred in weekly adult procedures (median before, 62; IQR, 54-70; median during, 36; IQR, 34-39; P < 0.001), and a 31% reduction occurred in weekly pediatric procedures (median before, 13; IQR, 12-14; median during, 9; IQR, 8-10; P = 0.004). Among adult procedures, the most significant decreases were seen for spine (P < 0.001) and endovascular (P < 0.001) procedures and cranioplasty (P < 0.001). A significant change was not found in the adult open vascular (P = 0.291), functional (P = 0.263), cranial tumor (P = 0.143), or hydrocephalus (P = 0.173) procedural volume. Weekly inpatient consultations to neurosurgery decreased by 24% (median before, 99; IQR, 94-114; median during, 75; IQR, 68-84; P = 0.008) for adults. Weekly in-person adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits witnessed a 91% decrease (median before, 329; IQR, 326-374; median during, 29; IQR, 26-39; P < 0.001).

How does TikTok change the experience culture in arts, and how does this impact how artists frame their working process alongside primary gatekeepers? During the COVID-19 pandemic, TikTok attracted many artists, who used the platform to take their practice, and thereby their self-marketing, into their own hands. At the same time, a new generation of collectors use TikTok to discover art under popular hashtag #feministartists. When artists label their work with #feministartists, they insert themselves into the gatekeeping process, and use opportunities and restrictions bounded to that specific hashtag. The study examines this process of professional self-positioning by using interviews with contemporary artists, curators, and observations on TikTok, artist talks, and secondary interviews with artists on online platforms. The findings suggest a variation in how one trades in or trades on feminist artist, accessing resources, and gaining exposure.

Parents are the decision makers in the case of children vaccination as they are responsible for them. This study aims to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children among parents in Saudi Arabia. METHODS This cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire. A 35-items questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms between June 6 and July 9-2021. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants' characteristics. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. Predictors of vaccination acceptance were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 581 parents were involved in this study. A majority of parents 63.9% reported that they will vaccinate their children if the vaccine becomes available. Around 40% of them confirmed that they want their child to be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly a quarter, 23.9%, reported that they will vaccinate their child against influenza this year. The most commonly reported reason for hesitancy was poor awareness about the vaccine's effectiveness on children. Adequate information about the COVID-19 vaccine was the most agreed cause to accept the vaccine. Having five or more children was a significant predictor for poor vaccination acceptance (OR: 0.42 (95%CI: 0.21-0.86), p < .05).

OBJECTIVE: to describe all outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in Scottish care-homes for older people between 01/03/2020 to 31/03/2020, with follow-up to 30/06/2020. DESIGN AND SETTING: national linked data cohort analysis of Scottish care-homes for older people. METHODS: data linkage was used to identify outbreaks of COVID-19 in care-homes. Care-home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak were examined using logistic regression. Size of outbreaks was modelled using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: 334 (41%) Scottish care-homes for older people experienced an outbreak, with heterogeneity in outbreak size (1C63 cases; median = 6) and duration (1C94 days; median = 31.5 days). Four distinct patterns of outbreak were identified: Typical (38% of outbreaks, mean 11.2 cases and 48 days duration), Severe (11%, mean 29.7 cases and 60 days), Contained (37%, mean 3.5 cases and 13 days), and Late-onset (14%, mean 5.4 cases and 17 days). Risk of a COVID-19 outbreak increased with increasing care-home size (for 90 beds vs <20, adjusted OR = 55.4, 95%CI 15.0C251.7) and rising community prevalence (OR = 1.2 [1.0C1.4] per 100 cases/100,000 population increase). No routinely available care-home characteristic was associated with outbreak size. CONCLUSIONS: reducing community prevalence of COVID-19 infection is essential to protect those living in care-homes.

Recent ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology now allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids in plasma. We herein intended to use the droplet-based digital PCR technology to obtain sensitive detection and precise quantification of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral load (SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 8 to 12 days after onset of symptoms and 12 healthy controls were analyzed. Disease severity was categorized as mild-to-moderate in 17 patients, severe in 16 patients and critical in 26 patients. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was quantified by droplet digital Crystal Digital PCR? next-generation technology (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif, France). RESULTS: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was detected in 43 (74.1%) patients. Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia correlated with disease severity, ranging from 53% in mild-to-moderate patients to 88% in critically ill patients (p=0.036). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia were associated with severity (p=0.035). Among nine patients who experienced clinical deterioration during follow-up, eight had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at baseline while only one critical patient with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at the time of analysis died at day 27.

Visual Social Distancing (VSD) offers an opportunity for real-time measuring and analysing the physical distance between pedestrians using surveillance videos in public spaces. It potentially provides new evidence for implementing effective prevention measures of the pandemic. The existing VSD methods developed in the literature are primarily based on frame-by-frame pedestrian detection, addressing the VSD problem from a static and local perspective. In this paper, we propose a new online multi-pedestrian tracking approach for spatio-temporal trajectory and its application to multi-scale social distancing measuring and analysis. Firstly, an online multi-pedestrian tracking method is proposed to obtain the trajectories of pedestrians in public spaces, based on hierarchical data association. Then, a new VSD method based on spatio-temporal trajectories is proposed. The proposed method not only considers the Euclidean distance between tracking objects frame-by-frame but also takes into account the discrete Frchet distance between trajectories, hence forms a comprehensive solution from both static and dynamic, local and holistic perspectives. We evaluated the performance of the proposed tracking method using the public dataset MOT16 benchmark. We also collected our own pedestrian dataset SCU-VSD and designed a multi-scale VSD analysis scheme for benchmarking the performance of the social distancing monitoring in the crowd. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieved outstanding performance on the analysis of social distancing.","output":"A novel social distancing analysis in urban public space: A new online spatio-temporal trajectory approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND An influenza pandemic, such as that of the H1N1 virus, raises questions about how to respond effectively to a lethal outbreak. Most plans have focused on minimizing impact by containing the virus through quarantine, but quarantine has not been used widely in the United States and little is known about what would be the public's response. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that influence an individual's decision to comply with a hypothetical avian influenza quarantine order. METHODS A total of 1204 adult Pennsylvania residents participated in a random digit dial telephone sample. The residents were interviewed regarding their attitudes about and knowledge of avian influenza and about compliance with quarantine orders, including staying at home or traveling to a government-designated facility. RESULTS Analysis of variance showed differences among demographic groups in willingness to comply with quarantine orders, with women and individuals not presently employed more willing to stay at home or to travel to a government-designated facility if ordered. Those who did not regularly attend religious services were significantly less willing than those who did attend regularly to comply with any type of quarantine order. Regression analysis indicated that demographic variables, overall knowledge of avian influenza, attitudes about its severity, and the belief that the respondent and/or his or her significant other(s) may contract it were predictive. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study can provide health planners and policy makers with information for improving their efforts to conduct a quarantine successfully, including crafting messages and targeting information to certain groups of people to communicate risk about the epidemic.","output":"If you ask them, will they come?

Study design and methods All consecutive patients referred to eight French intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 were included in our observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight.

We hypothesized that IL-6 trans-signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to endotheliopathy (a proinflammatory and procoagulant state) and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and ALT were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n=68), followed by a larger cohort(n=3,780) of COVID-19 patients. Liver histology from 43 COVID-19 patients was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, vWF activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen(P=0.02), factor VIII activity(P=0.02), and D-dimer(P<0.0001). On liver histology, COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet(P<0.0001) and vWF(P<0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining(P<0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (Factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF(P<0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble gp130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 siRNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy and endotheliopathy in the liver endothelium driven by IL-6 trans-signaling, a possible mechanism of liver injury. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in COVID-19 patients. This paper demonstrates that the IL-6 signaling complex causes harmful changes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and may promote blood clotting and contribute to liver injury.","output":"Liver injury in COVID-19 and IL-6 trans-signaling-induced endotheliopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is possible that parasites may influence the course of COVID-19 infection, as either risk factors or protective agents;as such, the current coronavirus pandemic may affect the diagnosis and prevention of parasitic disease, and its elimination programs.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the incidence density (cases per 10,000 patient days) of healthcare-facilityCassociated (HCFA) CDI in a tertiary-care hospital in Madrid, Spain, during the maximum incidence of COVID-19 (March 11 to May 11, 2020) with the same period of the previous year (control period). We also assessed the aggregate in-hospital antibiotic use (ie, defined daily doses [er 100 occupied bed days [BD]) and incidence density (ie, movements per 1,000 patient days) of patient mobility during both periods. RESULTS: In total, 2,337 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionCconfirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 period. Also, 12 HCFA CDI cases were reported at this time (incidence density, 2.68 per 10,000 patient days), whereas 34 HCFA CDI cases were identified during the control period (incidence density, 8.54 per 10,000 patient days) (P = .000257).

Recent evidence confirms that these chronic diseases increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality risk. Conversely, denser transit supportive environments may increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 suggesting the potential for contrasting chronic versus infectious disease impacts of community design. A handful of recent studies have examined links between density and COVID-19 mortality rates reporting conflicting results. Population density has been used as a surrogate of urban form to capture the degree of walkability and public transit versus private vehicle travel demand. The current study employs a broader range of built environment features (density, design, and destination accessibility) and assesses how chronic disease mediates the relationship between built and natural environment and COVID-19 mortality. Negative and significant relationships are observed between built and natural environment features and COVID-19 mortality when accounting for the mediating effect of chronic disease. Findings underscore the importance of chronic disease when assessing relationships between COVID-19 mortality and community design. Based on a rigorous simulation-assisted random parameter path analysis framework, we further find that the relationships between COVID-19 mortality, obesity, and key correlates exhibit significant heterogeneity. Ignoring this heterogeneity in highly aggregate spatial data can lead to incorrect conclusions with regards to the relationship between built environment and COVID-19 transmission. Results presented here suggest that creating walkable environments with greenspace is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease and/or COVID-19 infection and mortality.","output":"Treating two pandemics for the price of one: Chronic and infectious disease impacts of the built and natural environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 Timor-Leste became a successful case of managing to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to the early diligent action undertaken by the state authorities, albeit with significant popular resistance to the harsh measures imposed.

The CT lung volume was measured, and the ratio of the measured lung volume to the predicted total lung capacity (predTLC) based on sex, age and height was calculated. RESULTS: All cases showed crazy paving pattern in U-HRCT. In these lesions, the secondary lobules were smaller than those in the un-affected lungs. CT lung volume decreased in two cases comparing predTLC. CONCLUSION: U-HRCT can evaluate not only the distribution and hallmarks of COVID-19 pneumonia but also visualize local lung volume loss.","output":"Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography can demonstrate alveolar collapse in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In managing COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical interventions, occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is often used as an indicator to inform when to intensify mitigation and thus reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, strain on ICUs, and deaths. However, ICU occupancy thresholds at which action should be taken are often selected arbitrarily. We propose a quantitative approach using mathematical modeling to identify ICU occupancy thresholds at which mitigation should be triggered to avoid exceeding the ICU capacity available for COVID-19 patients. We used a stochastic compartmental model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, including critical cases that would require intensive care. We calibrated the model for the United States city of Chicago using daily COVID-19 ICU and hospital census data between March and August 2020. We projected ICU occupancies from September to May 2021 under two possible levels of transmission increase. The effect of combined mitigation measures was modeled as a decrease in the transmission rate that took effect when projected ICU occupancy reached a specified threshold. We found that mitigation did not immediately eliminate the risk of exceeding ICU capacity. Delaying action by 7 days increased the probability of exceeding ICU capacity by 10-60% and this increase could not be counteracted by stronger mitigation. Even under modest transmission increase, a threshold occupancy no higher than 60% was required when mitigation reduced the reproductive number Rt to just below 1. At higher transmission increase, a threshold of at most 40% was required with mitigation that reduced Rt below 0.75 within the first two weeks after mitigation. Our analysis demonstrates a quantitative approach for the selection of ICU occupancy thresholds that considers parameter uncertainty and compares relevant mitigation and transmission scenarios. An appropriate threshold will depend on the location, number of ICU beds available for COVID-19, available mitigation options, feasible mitigation strengths, and tolerated durations of intensified mitigation.","output":"Modeling robust COVID-19 intensive care unit occupancy thresholds for imposing mitigation to prevent exceeding capacities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the timeline of twenty years, several epidemics and pandemics have occurred. Yet, a consistent feature of these public health crises is the surge in the demand for healthcare services exceeds the availability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in the month of June and July 2020 in Karachi, Pakistan. The study participants included doctors and medical students residing in Karachi. RESULTS: Out of 187 doctors, 74.3% were working during the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 58.3% were willing to work. Out of 200 medical students, 93.5% were not volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 46% were willing to volunteer. Doctors strongly agreed that they would be willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic if they were healthy and able to do so (57.2%), if they were provided personal protective equipment (PPE) (51.3%), and if they were guaranteed coverage of treatment cost if they get infected while working (57.8%). Medical students strongly agreed that they would be willing to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic if they were provided PPE (49.0%), and if their parents were supportive of their decision to volunteer (44.5%). Most doctors (54.5%) felt that they were extremely likely to get infected while working during the COVID-19 pandemic and 59.4% felt that in turn, they were extremely likely to infect their families as well. Most medical students (40.5%) felt that they were somewhat likely to get infected while volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic and 55.5% felt that in turn, they were extremely likely to infect their family as well. In the event of infection with COVID-19, 51.3% doctors and 42.0% medical students felt that they would recover without hospitalization.

METHODS: A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real\\\\time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus\\\\A (ten and 14 with ON\\\\1 and NA\\\\2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961 g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks.

To determine if Q159L alone is sufficient to cause these altered pathogenic properties, targeted RNA recombination was used to introduce a Q159L amino acid substitution into the spike gene of MHV-A59. Recombination was carried out between the genome of a temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV-A59 (Alb4) and RNA transcribed from a plasmid (pFV1) containing the spike gene as well as downstream regions, through the 3' end, of the MHV-A59 genome. We have selected and characterized two recombinant viruses containing Q159L. These recombinant viruses (159R36 and 159R40) replicate in the brains of C57BL/6 mice and induce encephalitis to a similar extent as wild-type MHV-A59. However, they exhibit a markedly reduced ability to replicate in the liver or produce hepatitis compared to wild-type MHV-A59. These viruses also exhibit reduced virulence and reduced demyelination. A recombinant virus containing the wild-type MHV-A59 spike gene, wtR10, behaved essentially like wild-type MHV-A59.

Methods: We retrospectively selected 129 consecutive CLO patients who underwent curative liver resection between June 1999 and December 2016. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect TROP2 expression in paraffin-embedded specimens. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and independent prognostic factors were identified with Cox regression modeling. Results: TROP2 was expressed in 72.9% (94/129) of liver oligometastatic tissues. TROP2 expression in primary tumors and liver oligometastases was significantly positively correlated (r = 0.758, p < 0.001). Survival analysis indicated that CLO patients with high TROP2 expression had worse 3-year RFS (44.2% versus 66.4%, p = 0.007) and 3-year OS rates (70.3% versus 85.4%, p = 0.035) than did those with low TROP2 expression. Multivariate analysis indicated that high TROP2 expression was independently associated with poor RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.017; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.198-3.396; p = 0.023] and OS (HR = 2.090; 95% CI 1.037-4.214; p = 0.039).

The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the dissociation constants (KD) of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein as well as the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential applications, ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.","output":"Antibody Affinity Governs the Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Spike/ACE2 Binding in Patient Serum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus has significantly entered the globe and has affected everyone's life in some form or another.

AIMS: To describe the national and regional temporal trends in emergency department (ED) admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, before, during and after the first national lockdown. METHODS: The weekly numbers of ED admissions for MI and stroke were collected from the OSCOUR? network, which covers 93.3% of all ED admissions in France. National and regional incidence rate ratios from 02 February until 31 May (2020 versus 2017-2019) were estimated using Poisson regression for MI and stroke, before, during and after lockdown. RESULTS: A decrease in ED admissions was observed for MI (-20% for ST-segment elevation MI and-25% for non-ST-segment elevation MI) and stroke (-18% for ischaemic and-22% for haemorrhagic) during the lockdown. The decrease became significant earlier for stroke than for MI. No compensatory increase in ED admissions was observed at the end of the lockdown for these diseases. Important regional disparities in ED admissions were observed, without correlation with the regional levels of COVID-19 cases. The impact of lockdown on ED admissions was particularly significant in six regions (Ile-de France, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-C?te d'Azur, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hauts-de-France and Bretagne). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in ED admissions for MI and stroke observed during the lockdown was probably caused by fear of COVID-19 and augmented by the lockdown, and was heterogeneous across the French territory. ED admissions were slow to return to the usual levels from previous years, without a compensatory increase. These results underline the need to reinforce messages directed at the population to encourage them to seek care without delay in case of cardiovascular symptoms.","output":"Emergency department admissions for myocardial infarction and stroke in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: National temporal trends and regional disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to evaluate perioperative outcomes in initial experiences of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RARC) in comparison with those of laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) for muscle-invasive or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. METHODS We performed RARC on six patients with muscle-invasive or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer starting in October 2011. During the same period, another five patients underwent LRC. Perioperative outcomes in initial experiences of RARC were elucidated by comparing them with those of LRC. RESULTS Robot-assisted procedures were completed in all cases without conversion to open surgery. The median time of pneumoperitoneum was 252 minutes, and the median blood loss was 340 mL. No severe complications were observed. Perioperative outcomes did not significantly differ between RARC and LRC. Although two cases of troubles in uretero-conduit anastomosis sites were observed after LRC, no patients experienced postoperative complication related to urinary diversion after RARC. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that RARC is an acceptable option even in the initial period, and it may become one of the most favorable procedures for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the near future, although more tests and longer follow-ups are required to confirm its effectiveness and safety.","output":"Comparison of initial experiences of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with those of laparoscopic for bladder cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV\\\\2) is transmitted by droplet as well as airborne infection.

The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains undefined, and whether specific inflammatory biomarker patterns can distinguish MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory syndromes including Kawasaki disease (KD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is unknown.Methods: We studied a prospective cohort of nineteen MIS-C and nine KD patients and an established cohort of eleven new onset SJIA and nine MAS associated SJIA patients. Clinical and laboratory features as well as S100A8/A9, S100A12, IL-18, CXCL9 and IL-6 levels were compared between disease groups.Findings: KD and MIS-C patients have similar S100 proteins and IL-18 profiles but are distinguished by significantly higher levels of the IFN--induced chemokine CXCL9 in MIS-C. Stratifying MIS-C patients by CXCL9 levels revealed differential severity of clinical and laboratory presentation. MIS-C with high CXCL9 levels was associated with acute kidney injury, altered mental status, a higher frequency of shock (40 vs 90%), myocardial dysfunction (20 vs 50%), and more severe systemic inflammatory markers, cytopenia, and coagulopathy. The low CXCL9 MIS-C group in contrast resembled KD patients including the frequency of coronary involvement. We also found that elevated S100A8/A9, S100A12 and IL-18 were useful in distinguishing SJIA from KD with high sensitivity and specificity.Interpretation: Our findings show MIS-C is distinguished from KD primarily by elevated CXCL9. The stratification of CXCL9 levels of MIS-C patients provides support for MAS pathophysiology in patients with severe MIS-C, suggesting new approaches for diagnosis and management.Funding: This work was supported by an Academic Research Clinical (ARC) award to AG and GS from the Cincinnati Childrens Research Foundation.

The assessment was conducted on eight types of video sequences with diverse content obtained from the SJTU dataset. The sequences were encoded at 5 different constant bitrates in two widely video compression standards H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC at Full HD and Ultra HD resolutions, which means 160 annotated video sequences were created. The length of Group of Pictures (GOP) was set to half the framerate value, as is typical for video intended for transmission over a noisy communication channel. The evaluation was performed in two laboratories: one situated at the University of Zilina, and the second at the VSBTechnical University in Ostrava. The results acquired in both laboratories reached/showed a high correlation. Notwithstanding the fact that the sequences with low Spatial Information (SI) and Temporal Information (TI) values reached better Mean Opinion Score (MOS) score than the sequences with higher SI and TI values, these two parameters are not sufficient for scene description, and this domain should be the subject of further research. The evaluation results led us to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to use the H.265/HEVC codec for compression of Full HD sequences and the compression efficiency of the H.265 codec by the Ultra HD resolution reaches the compression efficiency of both codecs by the Full HD resolution. This paper also includes the recommendations for minimum bitrate thresholds at which the video sequences at both resolutions retain good and fair subjectively perceived quality.","output":"Impact of Scene Content on High Resolution Video Quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It has remained a concern whether any long-term pulmonary sequelae exist for COVID-19 survivors. Methods: Forty-one patients (22 men and 19 women, 50  14 years) confirmed with COVID-19 performed follow-up chest CT and cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 7 months after discharge. Patients were divided into fibrosis group and non-fibrosis group according to the evidence of fibrosis on follow-up CT. The clinical data and the CT findings were recorded and analyzed. Results: The predominant CT patterns of abnormalities observed at 7 months after discharge were parenchymal band (41%), interlobular septal thickening (32%), and traction bronchiectasis (29%). Sixty-one percent of the patients achieved complete radiological resolution, and 29% of patients developed pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with the patients in the non-fibrosis group, the patients in the fibrosis group were older, with a longer hospital stay, a higher rate of steroid and mechanical ventilation therapy, lower levels of lymphocyte and T cell count, higher levels of D-dimer and lactic dehydrogenase, and higher quantitative CT parameters (opacity score, volume of opacity, and percentage of opacity) at discharge. Besides, oxygen consumption and metabolic equations were decreased and ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide was increased in patients in the fibrosis group. Logistic regression analyses revealed that age, steroid therapy, presence of traction bronchiectasis on chest CT at discharge, and opacity score at discharge, were independent risk factors for developing pulmonary fibrosis at 7 months after discharge. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the combined clinical-radiological model was better than the clinical-only model in the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusions: The chest CT lesions could be absorbed without any sequelae for most patients with COVID-19, whereas older patients with severe conditions are more prone to develop fibrosis, which may further lead to cardiopulmonary insufficiency. The combined clinical-radiological model may predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.","output":"Follow-Up Study of the Chest CT Characteristics of COVID-19 Survivors Seven Months After Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, and has resulted in an unprecedented, international collaborative effort to develop vaccines to control the outbreak, protect human lives, and avoid further social and economic disruption. Mass vaccination campaigns are underway in multiple countries and are expected worldwide once more vaccine becomes available. Some early candidate vaccines use novel platforms, such as mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, and relatively new platforms, such as replication-deficient viral vectors. While these new vaccine platforms hold promise, limited safety data in humans are available. Serious health outcomes linked to vaccinations are rare, and some outcomes may occur incidentally in the vaccinated population. Knowledge of background incidence rates of these medical conditions is a critical component of vaccine safety monitoring to aid in the assessment of adverse events temporally associated with vaccination and to put these events into context with what would be expected due to chance alone. A list of 22 potential adverse events of special interest (AESI), including neurologic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders, was compiled by subject matter experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recently available U.S. background rates for these medical conditions, overall and by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (when available), were sourced from reported statistics (data published by medical panels/ associations or federal government reports), and literature reviews in PubMed. This review provides estimates of background incidence rates for medical conditions that may be monitored or studied as AESI during safety surveillance and research for COVID-19 vaccines and other new vaccines.","output":"U.S. Population-Based Background Incidence Rates of Medical Conditions for Use in Safety Assessment of COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"medical service robot, human-robot interaction, COVID-19, sensor fusion The cabin hospitals used for COVID-19 victims have an infectious environment and thus require highly autonomous systems to provide various services.
