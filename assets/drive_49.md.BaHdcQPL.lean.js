Moreover, the inflation rate is still very low despite the European Central Banks interventions. Twelve years later, a health crisis occurred. The ECB have reacted to this event by using monetary tools. We can cite for example the famous temporary Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to save the Euro-zone countries from a systemic disaster.

While effective as a pain reducer, CEL exerts some negative influence on renal and gastrointestinal parameters. This study examined CEL pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics following drug reformulation as a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticle (NP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Rats were administered either vehicle (VEH) (methylcellulose solution), blank NP, 40 mg/kg CEL in methylcellulose, or an equivalent NP dose (CEL-NP). Plasma and urine (over 12 hrs) samples were collected prior to and post-treatment. The mean percent change from baseline of urine flow rate along with electrolyte concentrations in plasma and urine were assessed based on 100 g body weight. Using tissues collected 24 hrs post-treatment, gastrointestinal inflammation was estimated through duodenal and gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and duodenal myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels; while kidney tissue was examined for dilatation and necrosis. CEL concentration was assayed in renal tissue and plasma utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS Although there were significant changes when comparing CEL and CEL-NP to VEH in plasma sodium concentration and potassium excretion rate, there was no significant variation between CEL and CEL-NP. There was a significant reduction of protective duodenal PGE2 in CEL compared to VEH (p = 0.0088) and CEL-NP (p = 0.02). In the CEL-NP formulation, t1/2, Cmax, AUC0-, and Vd/F increased significantly when compared to CEL. CONCLUSIONS At the observed dosage and duration, CEL-NP may not affect CEL-associated electrolyte parameters in either plasma or urine; however, it does provide increased systemic exposure while potentially alleviating some gastrointestinal outcomes related to inflammation.","output":"Assessment of celecoxib poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoformulation on drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Granger causality is a commonly used method for uncovering information flow and dependencies in a time series.

We find that a recently developed mouse-adapted MA-SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as the emerging B. 1.351 variant, trigger an inflammatory response in the lung characterized by expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes. scRNA-seq analysis of lung homogenates identified a hyper-inflammatory monocyte profile.

We utilize this model to demonstrate that mechanistically, CCR2 signaling promotes infiltration of classical monocytes into the lung and expansion of monocyte-derived cells. Parenchymal monocyte-derived cells appear to play a protective role against MA-SARS-CoV-2, as mice lacking CCR2 showed higher viral loads in the lungs, increased lung viral dissemination, and elevated inflammatory cytokine responses.

DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. RESULTS: Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation.

Design / Methodology / Approach: This study was carried out with relevant indicators of the oil and gas industry (downstream). Commercialization data (from 2017 to 2020) were compared in order to verify the pandemic impacts. After collecting the data, we used the Momentum approach to prospect the scenarios, suggesting a strategic action plan for each prospection. Results: The results reveal that, regardless the post-pandemic scenario that we will encounter, the industries belonging to the oil and gas sector will have to define strategies and implement solid action plans to remain competitive in the market. It was also possible to note that the action plan for the desirable and trend scenario has synergy. Limitations of the investigation: The results obtained in this research refer only to the Brazilian scenario, more specifically to the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry and may differ from other sectors or regions. Practical implications: This research provides ways for oil and gas companies to be prepared for the post-pandemic future, thus remaining competitive in the market. In addition, as a result of applying the Momentum method, it is possible to see how the sector's indicators relate to each other through the cross-impact matrix. Originality / Value: This is an unprecedented study that allows the downstream oil and gas companies to be better prepared to the post-COVID-19 scenario. It adds value not only to the oil and gas industry but also to other industries, since it is possible to replicate the method presented here in other contexts with different databases. ? 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

The significance of these variables has increased in the current era when the influence of technology is exponentially increasing in the education sector. We investigate the role of ethical leadership in determining innovative work behavior. Moreover, we investigate the moderating effect of WB in the relationship between EL and WE. We also examine the mediating impact of WE in the relationship between EL and IWB. We used a questionnaire survey approach to collect data. The target population of this study was the academic personnel, i.e., senior professors, lecturers, and supporting staff associated with the higher education sector located in Zhejiang Province, China. Data were collected in two phases. In the first phase, we sent 300 research questionnaires and received 251 responses. In the second phase, after a three-month interval, we sent 200 questionnaires and received 162 responses. However, over the two phases, we collected a total of 413 questionnaires; 43 were discarded. Therefore, for analysis, we used 370 questionnaires. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling through SmartPLS 3.2.2. First, in the direct relationship, results confirm that EL positively influences the IWB. Secondly, WB has a positive and moderating relationship between EL and IWB. Thirdly, we address the relationship between EL and WE. The outcome indicates that there is a positive and significant relationship. Fourth, the results of this study indicate that there is positive and significant relationship between WE and IWB. Finally, the outcomes imply that WE positively mediates between EL and IWB. Ethical leadership and well-being are important for innovative work behavior that supports managers in introducing a supportive workplace environment that promotes good interpersonal relationships with subordinates. Therefore, a good interpersonal relationship between managers and subordinates enhances the work quality. So, ethical leaders provide a supportive work environment to all subordinates regarding their work.","output":"The Linkage between Ethical Leadership, Well-Being, Work Engagement, and Innovative Work Behavior: The Empirical Evidence from the Higher Education Sector of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is the provision of healthcare-related services from a distance and is poised to move healthcare from the physician's office back into the patient's home.

A monumental challenge accompanied is continuous and effective disinfection of shared spaces, such as office/school buildings, elevators, classrooms, and cafeterias. Although ultraviolet light and chemical sprays are routines for indoor disinfection, they irritate humans, hence can only be used when the facility is unoccupied. Stationary air filtration systems, while being irritation-free and commonly available, fail to protect all occupants due to limitations in air circulation and diffusion. Hence, we present a novel collaborative robot (cobot) disinfection system equipped with a Bernoulli Air Filtration Module, with a design that minimizes disturbance to the surrounding airflow and maneuverability among occupants for maximum coverage. The influence of robotic air filtration on dosage at neighbors of a coughing source is analyzed with derivations from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Based on the analysis, the novel occupant-centric online rerouting algorithm decides the path of the robot. The rerouting ensures effective air filtration that minimizes the risk of occupants under their detected layout. The proposed system was tested on a 2  3 seating grid (empty seats allowed) in a classroom, and the worst-case dosage for all occupants was chosen as the metric. The system reduced the worst-case dosage among all occupants by 26% and 19% compared to a stationary air filtration system with the same flow rate, and a robotic air filtration system that traverses all the seats but without occupant-centric planning of its path, respectively.

METHODS: We used a unique statewide dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases across Missouri, linked with historical statewide hospital data. We examined differences by race and ethnicity in raw population-based case and mortality rates. We used patient-level regression analyses to calculate the odds of mortality based on race and ethnicity, controlling for comorbidities and other risk factors. RESULTS: As of September 10, 2020 there were 73,635 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of Missouri. Among the 64,526 case records (87.7% of all cases) that merged with prior demographic and health care utilization data, 12,946 (20.1%) were Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, 44,550 (69.0%) were NH White, 3,822 (5.9%) were NH Other/Unknown race, and 3,208 (5.0%) were Hispanic. Raw cumulative case rates for NH Black individuals were 1,713 per 100,000 population, compared with 2,095 for NH Other/Unknown, 903 for NH White, and 1,218 for Hispanic. Cumulative COVID-19-related death rates for NH Black individuals were 58.3 per 100,000 population, compared with 38.9 for NH Other/Unknown, 19.4 for NH White, and 14.8 for Hispanic.

Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A preclinical and short-term prospective study was performed. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into five groups, with four rabbits per group, each receiving a different concentration of Artemia salina. In each rabbit, an extract of Artemia salina (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) was randomly instilled in one eye and saline solution (negative control) in the other eye. Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured before and after the instillation of five drops per eye (one drop per hour) on the same day. RESULTS: In tear secretion, there was an increase of 43.88  6.73% with 4% Artemia salina in comparison with its baseline measurement (P = .049). The rest of the groups did not show differences (P &#8805; 0.05).

One anti-hexon neutralizing antibody, called 9C12, is known to activate the complement cascade, resulting in the deposition of complement component C4b on the capsid, and the neutralization of the virus. The mechanism of AdV neutralization by C4b is independent of downstream complement proteins and involves the blockage of the release of protein VI, which is required for viral escape from the endosome. To investigate the structural basis underlying how C4b blocks the uncoating of AdV, we built a model for the complex of human adenovirus type-5 (HAdV5) with 9C12, together with complement components C1 and C4b. This model positions C4b near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) loops of the penton base. There are multiple amino acids in the RGD loop that might serve as covalent binding sites for the reactive thioester of C4b. Molecular dynamics simulations with a multimeric penton base and C4b indicated that stabilizing interactions may form between C4b and multiple RGD loops.

The filtration efficiency of the masks is a key testing element that examines its ability to filter particles, bacteria and viruses; this examines the penetration efficiency percentage of each with lower results being preferable. Masks are also subjected to NaCl testing method, which allows a range of particle sizes to be examined and their penetration to be observed. The masks must also show considerable resistance to fluids and flames, to prevent the penetration of liquids and to be non-flammable. Various PPE testing protocols such as biological, chemical, fluid and flame resistances, protective ensemble, facepiece fit testing, NIOSH NaCl method and impact protection have been discussed.

However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (&#967;262=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (&#967;234=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (?=-.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (?=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (?=.09; P=.02) and older people (?=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (?=-.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (?=.01; P=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in either age group (P>.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger people (?=.02; P=.04) and older people (?=.03; P=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among either age group (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social media may be a \\"double-edged sword\\" for psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its roles vary across age groups.

Coping mechanisms to manage their stress are multifactorial. The COVID-19 pandemic has added additional stressors not yet fully understood. Objective: Although some understanding of stress and coping of ATSs exists, little is known about how they coped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our purpose was to better understand the coping response to stress for ATSs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Phenomenological qualitative study. Setting: Web-based (Zoom) interviews. Patients or Other Participants: Fourteen Professional Master of Athletic Training students (9 female, 5 male) from 14 colleges and universities completed semistructured Web-based interviews. On average, the participants were 26  4 years old. Data Collection and Analysis: All interviews were recorded via the Zoom platform and then transcribed by Otter. Basic member checks to ensure accuracy of the transcription process were completed with all participants before analyzing the data. Peer review was also completed. Results: Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) the importance of flexibility and adaptability, (2) the need for empathy toward others and self, and (3) various stress management strategies. All themes transcended stress reduction, and each had potential implications for their future roles as athletic trainers. Conclusions: Students enrolled in professional master's programs experienced increased stress, not only due to COVID-19 but in general due to the demands of the role of students in health care professional programs. Learning to be effective time and stress managers will be important for professional longevity as other stressful events are likely.","output":"Athletic Training Student Coping Strategies during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The process of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) within a community of practice framework (CoP) was used to explore graduate entry medical students' professional identity formation (PIF) during their first year of study. A conceptual model has been developed that can be used by medical educators to better understand PIF and to aid the explicit incorporation of PIF activity within the undergraduate curriculum. METHODS Ten students from one UK medical school participated in the longitudinal study and were interviewed at three points during the first year. Semi-structured group interviews were used to explore students' experience of the clinical environment and the nature of their interactions with both clinicians and patients in a community-based medicine practice. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify overarching themes which are represented as facets in the model of PIF. RESULTS Results demonstrate that students are legitimately peripherally participating within both medical student CoPs and wider medical CoPs. Themes identified within the narratives have allowed the development of a new model to understand PIF within the context of LPP in a CoP. This has five facets: Awareness, Collaboration, Negotiation, Evaluation and Realisation. Sophisticated reflection-in-action is shown to be an important aspect of PIF and enables a more conscious understanding of the change that is occurring in our students. CONCLUSION PIF is a complex, non-linear process that is supported by reflection-in-action and early student introduction to clinical practice. It can be recognised in students' narratives in their changing use of language, their understanding of the medical COP, and their evolving relational participation with those around them. This study adds to those that have previously explored PIF. The model of PIF developed in this study illustrates how experiences in the clinical environment support PIF. Medical educators may find this model helpful when considering how PIF can be explicitly encouraged in the medical curriculum and how reflection may be used for the purpose of identity change.","output":"It's how we practice that matters: professional identity formation and legitimate peripheral participation in medical students: a qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often results in pneumonia and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ARDS is one of the most significant causes of death in patients with COVID-19 The development of a cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 causes progression to ARDS In this scoping review, we investigated the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inducing moderate and severe ARDS outcomes A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar to implement a broad query that captured all the relevant studies published between December 2019 and September 2020 We identified seven studies that evaluated the immune response in COVID-19 patients with ARDS The white blood cell counts (WBCs), CRP, and IL-6 were higher in the moderately presenting ARDS patients, critically ill patients, and those with more severe ARDS This study may contribute to better patient management and outcomes if tailored immune marker interventions are implemented in the near future","output":"The Immunological Response Among COVID-19 Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 34th International Mammalian Genome Conference (IMGC) was held in conjunction with The Allied Genetics Conference (TAGC2020).

This virus has challenged civilization and modern science in ways that few infectious diseases and natural disasters have previously, causing globally significant human morbidity and mortality and triggering economic downturns across financial markets that will be dealt with for generations. Despite this, the pandemic has also brought an opportunity for humanity to come together and participate in a shared scientific investigation. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with lower mortality rates than other recently emerged coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits efficient human-to-human spread, with transmission often occurring before symptom recognition; this feature averts containment strategies that had worked previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses associated with pulmonary congestion and intravascular coagulopathy leading to pneumonia, vascular insults, and multiorgan disease. Approaches to treatment have combined supportive care with antivirals, such as remdesivir, with immunomodulatory medications, including corticosteroids and cytokine-blocking antibody therapies; these treatments have advanced rapidly through clinical trials. Innovative approaches to vaccine development have facilitated rapid advances in design, testing, and distribution.

METHODS Volunteers randomly received two doses of CoronaVac or placebo, separated by two weeks. 434 volunteers were enrolled, 397 aged 18-59 years, and 37 aged 60 years. Solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions were registered from all volunteers. Blood samples were obtained from a subset of volunteers and analyzed for humoral and cellular measures of immunogenicity. RESULTS The primary adverse reaction in the 434 volunteers was pain at the injection site, with a higher incidence in the vaccine than in the placebo arm. Adverse reactions observed were mostly mild and local. No severe adverse events were reported. The humoral evaluation was performed on 81 volunteers. Seroconversion rates for specific anti-S1-RBD IgG were 86.67% in the 18-59 age group and 70.37% in the 60 age group, two and four weeks after the second dose. A significant increase in circulating neutralizing antibodies was detected two and four weeks after the second dose. The cellular evaluation was performed on 47 volunteers. We detected a significant induction of T cell responses characterized by the secretion of IFN-upon stimulation with Mega Pools of peptides from SARS-CoV-2.

We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways.

We use developer seniority as a metric to measure whether the proposed method is easier. By using agent-based simulation and NanoVC repos for agent arbitration, we are able to create a simulated environment where patterns developed by people are used to transform working prototypes into templates that data can be fed through to create the robots that create the production code. Having two layers of robots allow early implementation choices to be replaced as we gather more feedback from the working system. Several benefits of this approach have been discovered, with the most notable being that the Robot of Robots encodes a legacy of the person that designed it in the form of the 3 ingredients (data, patterns and working prototypes). This method allows us to achieve our goal of reducing the fragility of the production code while removing the difficulty of getting there.","output":"Nano Version Control and Robots of Robots: Data Driven, Regenerative Production Code"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A long duration of untreated psychosis reduces benefits of early intervention for early psychosis. Digital technologies have potential to encourage help-seeking and reduce barriers to care. Because of high rates of smartphone ownership, mobile health (mHealth) interventions may be particularly well-suited to increase access. There is a lack of available information on the specific features that may be most appealing to young adults with early psychosis. The present study remotely recruited 77 young adults with psychosis and surveyed their interest in mHealth features, delivery modalities, and attitudes toward treatment. Overall, respondents reported high utilization of digital health and high interest in psychosis-specific mHealth. They expressed the highest interest (ordered by mean score by item) in information about medications and side effects (n = 69, 89.6% reporting being interested or very interested), managing stress and improving mood (n = 67, 89.3%) and symptoms of psychosis (n = 66, 88%), as well as in tracking changes in symptoms (n = 70, 90.9%), and goals (n = 66, 86.9%). They also reported high interest in content being delivered as text (n = 69, 89.6%) and also in communicating directly with providers. Respondents were less interested in social features, and those with most negative attitudes toward help-seeking had particularly low interest in features related to disclosing symptoms to others. These results suggest mHealth may have potential to engage individuals with early psychosis, and that the most effective strategies may be those that are most straightforward, including direct psychoeducational information.","output":"mHealth for Young Adults with Early Psychosis: User Preferences and Their Relationship to Attitudes About Treatment-Seeking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has begun in China and is still affecting thousands of patient lives worldwide daily. Although Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography are the gold standard medical imaging modalities for diagnosing potentially infected COVID-19 cases, applying Ultrasound (US) imaging technique to accomplish this crucial diagnosing task has attracted many physicians recently. In this article, we propose two modified deep learning classifiers to identify COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in US images, based on generative adversarial neural networks (GANs). The proposed image classifiers are a semi-supervised GAN and a modified GAN with auxiliary classifier. Each one includes a modified discriminator to identify the class of the US image using semi-supervised learning technique, keeping its main function of defining the realness of tested images. Extensive tests have been successfully conducted on public dataset of US images acquired with a convex US probe. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using chest US images with two GAN classifiers as a new radiological tool for clinical check of COVID-19 patients. The results of our proposed GAN models showed that high accuracy values above 91.0% were obtained under different sizes of limited training data, outperforming other deep learning-based methods, such as transfer learning models in the recent studies. Consequently, the clinical implementation of our computer-aided diagnosis of US-COVID-19 is the future work of this study. ? 2021 Tech Science Press.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%C28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2C4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%C96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%C96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination.

Furthermore, women with PCOS have increased risks for several metabolic complications, which need long-term health management. Therefore, we attempted to establish an easily applicable model to identify such women at an early stage. OBJECTIVE: To develop an easy-to-use tool for screening PCOS based on medical records from a large assisted reproductive technology (ART) center in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort from Peking University Third Hospital was used in the study. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation was applied to construct the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity values were used to evaluate and compare the models. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 21,219 ovarian stimulation cycle records from January to December 2019 in Peking University Third Hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was whether there was a clinical diagnosis of PCOS. The independent variables included were age, body mass index (BMI), upper limit of menstrual cycle length (UML), basal serum levels of anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH), testosterone androstenedione, antral follicle counts et al. RESULTS: We have established a new mathematical model for diagnosing PCOS using serum AMH and androstenedione levels, UML, and BMI, with AUC values of 0.855 (0.838C0.870), 0.848 (0.791C0.891), 0.846 (0.812C0.875) in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The contribution of each predictor to this model were: AMH 41.2%; UML 35.2%; BMI 4.3%; and androstenedione 3.7%. The top 10 groups of women most predicted to develop PCOS were demonstrated. An online tool (http://121.43.113.123:8888/) has been developed to assist Chinese ART clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The models and online tool we established here might be helpful for screening and identifying women with undiagnosed PCOS in Asian populations and could assist in the long-term management of related metabolic disorders.","output":"A Model for Predicting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Using Serum AMH, Menstrual Cycle Length, Body Mass Index and Serum Androstenedione in Chinese Reproductive Aged Population: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to compare the severity of psychological impact, anxiety and depression between people from two developing countries, Iran and China, and to correlate mental health parameters with variables relating to the COVID-19 pandemic Although China and Iran are developing countries based on the World Banks criteria, these two countries are different in access to resources and health care systems We hypothesized that Iranians would show higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress as compared to Chinese Methods: This study collected information related to the COVID-19 pandemic including physical health, precautionary measures and knowledge about the pandemic We also used validated questionnaires such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess the mental health status Results: There were a total of 1411 respondents (550 from Iran;861 from China) The mean IES-R scores of respondents from both countries were above the cut-off for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms Iranians had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0 01) Significantly more Iranians believed COVID-19 was transmitted via contact, practised hand hygiene, were unsatisfied with health information and expressed less confidence in their doctors, but were less likely to wear a facemask (p &lt; 0 001) Significantly more Iranians received health information related to COVID-19 via television while Chinese preferred the Internet (p &lt; 0 001) Conclusions: This cross-country study found that Iranians had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression as compared to Chinese The difference in reported measures between respondents from Iran and China were due to differences in access to healthcare services and governments responses to the pandemic","output":"Mental Health of the General Population during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Tale of Two Developing Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients is higher than in non-COVID-19 patients.

Early in the pandemic, the interleukin 6 (IL 6) receptor antibody Tocilizumab was considered in view of the cytokine release syndrome associated with COVID 19 infection. Several early observational studies showed beneficial effect of treatment with Tocilizumab on mortality, however, results from well designed randomized clinical trials (RCT) were contradicting. Objectives: To perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of RCTs utilizing Tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID 19 pneumonia, with in hospital mortality as a primary objective, while secondary objectives included composite outcome of mortality, intubation, or ICU admission, another secondary outcome was super added infection. Method: This was a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) model of relative risk (RR), along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, p values, and forest plots of both primary and secondary outcomes. A fixed effect sensitivity test was performed for the primary outcome, in addition to subgroup and meta regression analyses with predefined criteria. Results: The primary outcome of mortality showed statistically insignificant reduction of mortality with Tocilizumab (RR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.01; p = 0.09) although with an unmistakable apparent clinical benefit. There was a significant reduction in the RR of the secondary composite outcome (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.9; p < 0.001), and no difference between groups in super added infection (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.19; p = 0.24). Treatment protocol allowing a second dose was the only significant predictor of improved mortality in the meta regression analysis. Certainty of evidence was reduced to moderate for the primary outcome and the secondary outcome of clinical deterioration, while it was reduced to low for the secondary outcome of super added infection. Conclusion: Moderate certainty of evidence suggest no statistically significant improvement of 28-30 day all cause mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ, although there may be clinically important value. Moderate certainty of evidence suggest lowered relative risk of a composite outcome of death or clinical deterioration, while, low grade evidence indicate no increase in the risk of super added infection associated with TCZ treatment. A protocol allowing two doses of TCZ shows evidence of improved mortality as compared to a strictly single dose protocol.","output":"Tocilizumab Effect in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Control Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produ??o do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publica??es cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referentes ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classifica??o metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avalia??o da qualidade metodolgica Essa avalia??o tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomenda??o oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 14 artigos e 13 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 17 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To examine the feasibility of three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) image fusion in facilitating assessment of the ablative margin (AM) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The aim of this study was to evaluate pulmonary, cardiac, and functional capacity of SARS-CoV-2 survivors at 3 months after initial diagnosis by performing cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods CPET was proposed to all patients who were treated both in and out of hospital settings at a tertiary university hospital at 3 months (1 month) after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 114 patients were included in the study. The median age was 57 [48C66] and 30% were women. 91% required in-hospital treatment during the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and 22% needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. At 3-month follow-up, 51% of patients were still symptomatic and 40% reported dyspnea at exertion. During CPET, 71% of patients had impairment of exercise capacity, mostly due to muscle deconditioning (43%) and/or hyperventilation (16%).

These changes may arise from elongation of the Achilles tendon. An observational study was performed to quantify the Achilles tendon resting angle (ATRA) in patients following Achilles tendon rupture, surgical repair, and rehabilitation, respectively. Methods Between May 2012 and January 2013, 26 consecutive patients (17 men), with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 42 (8) years were included and evaluated following injury, repair, and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, respectively (rehabilitation period). The outcome was measured using the ATRA, Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS), and heel-rise test. Results Following rupture, the mean (SD) absolute ATRA was 55 (8) for the injured side compared with 43 (7) (p < 0.001) for the noninjured side. Immediately after repair, the angle reduced to 37 (9) (p < 0.001). The difference between the injured and noninjured sides, the relative ATRA, was -12.5 (4.3) following injury; this was reduced to 7 (7.9) following surgery (p < 0.001). During initial rehabilitation, at the 6-week time point, the relative ATRA was 2.6 (6.2) (p = 0.04) and at 3 months it was -6.5 (6.5) (p < 0.001). After the 3-month time point, there were no significant changes in the resting angle. The ATRS improved significantly (p < 0.001) during each period up to 9 months following surgery, where a score of 85 (10) was reported. The heel-rise limb symmetry index was 66 (22)% at 9 months and 82 (14)% at 12 months. At 3 months and 6 months, the absolute ATRA correlated with the ATRS (r = 0.63, p = 0.001, N = 26 and r = 0.46, p = 0.027, N = 23, respectively). At 12 months, the absolute ATRA correlated with the heel-rise height (r = -0.63, p = 0.002, N = 22). Conclusion The ATRA increases following injury, is reduced by surgery, and then increases again during initial rehabilitation. The angle also correlates with patient-reported symptoms early in the rehabilitation phase and with heel-rise height after 1 year.

METHODS: We analyzed data from four cross-sectional telephone/online surveys from April to June 2020 to investigate such changes since the 1st and 2nd wave outbreaks (February to April 2020) in Hong Kong. The respondents were 1595 adults (83.2% male) who used tobacco before the COVID-19 outbreak from our previous intervention study and surveys. We investigated the changes in tobacco use, intention to quit and quit attempts during the outbreak. RESULTS: About two-thirds (65.3%) of respondents reported no change in overall tobacco use, while 23.1% used less (including cessation) and 11.6% used more, resulting in a net decrease of 11.5 percentage points. A greater net decrease was observed for cigarettes (14.3% points) than heated tobacco products (HTPs, 3.3% points) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, 2.5% points). Decreased use was mainly due to the more extended stay at home (63.2%), health considerations (52.6%) and mask-wearing (47.4%), while increased use was for passing time (75.0%) and releasing stress (46.4%). Eight percent of cigarette, HTP and e-cigarette users reported a higher intention to quit since the pandemic outbreak. Nineteen percent of tobacco users (176/948) attempted to quit during the pandemic. Only 2.9% (46/1569) were abstinent at the time of the survey.

This was performed on two separate occasions (between-day reliability). Accuracy and validity were compared with a routinely used protocol [i.e. 50%, 75%, and 100% of MVC (1x3C) performed three times (3x3C)]. RESULTS 95% confidence interval for estimated resting twitch, a key determinant of VATMS, was similar between 1x5C, 2x5C, and 3x3C but improved by six-fold when compared to 1x3C (P<0.05). In a fresh state, potentiated twitch force was unchanged following 1x5C but decreased following 2x5C (P<0.05). A recovery was found post-exercise but was smaller for 1x5C compared to 2x5C (P<0.05), with no difference between the latter two (P>0.05). Absolute reliability was strong enough for both 1x5C and 2x5C to depict a true detectable change in the sample's VATMS following the fatiguing exercise (TEM < 3% at rest, <9% post-exercise) but 2x5C was marginally more sensitive to individual's changes from baseline. CONCLUSION Both 1x5C and 2x5C provide reliable measures of VATMS. However, 1x5C may hold stronger internal validity. Both protocols allow detection of 'true' changes in sample's means but not individual scores following a fatiguing isometric exercise.","output":"Improving the measurement of TMS-assessed voluntary activation in the knee extensors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A central question in evolution is how several adaptive phenotypes are maintained within a species. Theory predicts that the genetic determination of a trait, and in particular the amounts of redundancy in the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, mediates evolutionary outcomes of phenotypic selection. In Mediterranean wild thyme, numerous discrete chemical phenotypes (chemotypes) occur in close geographic proximity. Chemotypes are defined by the predominant monoterpene produced by individual plants in their essential oil. In this study, we analyze the ecological genetics of six chemotypes nested within two well-established chemical families (hereafter ecotypes). Ecotypes, and chemotypes within ecotypes, are spatially segregated, and their distributions track local differences in the abiotic environment. By combining population genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from 700 individuals, we show how the genetics of ecotype determination mediates this evolutionary response. Variation in three terpene-synthase loci explains variation in ecotype identity, with one single locus accounting for as much as 78% of this variation. Phenotypic selection combined with low segregating genotypic redundancy of ecotypes leaves a clear footprint at the genomic level: alleles associated with ecotype identity track environmental variation despite extensive gene flow. Different chemotypes within each ecotype differentially track environmental variation. Their identity is determined by multiple loci and displays a wider range of genotypic redundancy that dilutes phenotypic selection on their characteristic alleles. Our study thus provides a novel illustration of how genetic redundancy of a phenotype modulates the ability of selection to maintain adaptive differentiation. Identifying the precise genetics of the chemical polymorphism in thyme is the next crucial step for our understanding of the origin and maintenance of a polymorphism that is present in many aromatic plants.","output":"From genotype to phenotype: Genetic redundancy and the maintenance of an adaptive polymorphism in the context of high gene flow."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a combination of clinical and hematological information, collected on day of presentation to the hospital with pneumonia, was evaluated for its ability to predict severity and mortality outcomes in COVID-19. Ours is a retrospective, observational study of 203 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All of them were confirmed RT-PCR positive cases. We used simple hematological parameters (total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ration and platelet to lymphocyte ratio); and a severity classification of pneumonia (mild, moderate and severe) based on a single clinical parameter, the percentage saturation of oxygen at room air, to predict the outcome in these cases. The results show that a high absolute neutrophil count on day of onset of pneumonia symptoms correlated strongly with both severity and survival in COVID-19. In addition, it was the primary driver of an initial high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) observed in patients with severe disease. The effect of low lymphocyte count was not found to be very significant in our cohort. Multivariate logistic regression was done using Python 3.7 to assess whether these parameters can adequately predict survival. We found that clinical severity and a high neutrophil count on day of presentation of pneumonia symptoms could predict the outcome with 86% precision. This model is undergoing further evaluation at our centre for validation using data collected during the second wave of COVID-19. We present the relevance of an elevated neutrophil count in COVID-19 pneumonia and review the advances in research which focus on neutrophils as an important effector cell of COVID-19 inflammation.","output":"COVID-19 mortality prediction model, 3C-M, built for use in resource limited settings - understanding the relevance of neutrophilic leukocytosis in predicting disease severity and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transparent materials used for facial protection equipment provide protection against microbial infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. However, transparent materials used for this type of application are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. They just avoid direct contact between the person and the biological agent. Therefore, healthy people can become infected through contact of the contaminated material surfaces and this equipment constitute an increasing source of infectious biological waste. Furthermore, infected people can transmit microbial infections easily because the protective equipment do not inactivate the microbial load generated while breathing, sneezing or coughing. In this regard, the goal of this work consisted of fabricating a transparent face shield with intrinsic antimicrobial activity that could provide extra-protection against infectious agents and reduce the generation of infectious waste. Thus, a single-use transparent antimicrobial face shield composed of polyethylene terephthalate and an antimicrobial coating of benzalkonium chloride has been developed for the next generation of facial protective equipment. The antimicrobial coating was analyzed by atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy with elemental analysis. This is the first facial transparent protective material capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one minute of contact, and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial infections contribute to severe pneumonia associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing. Our extra protective broad-spectrum antimicrobial composite material could also be applied for the fabrication of other facial protective tools such as such as goggles, helmets, plastic masks and space separation screens used for counters or vehicles.

This study is aimed at investigating the utility and potential influencing factors of IL-6 and the common biomarkers for diagnosing FRI. Preoperative serological levels of IL-6 and the three biomarkers were compared between 407 FRI patients and 195 fracture-healed (FH) patients. Diagnostic efficiency of the indicators was evaluated using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their potential influencing factors were also analyzed. Outcomes showed that the median levels of all of the four biomarkers were significantly higher among the FRI patients than those among the FH patients (P < 0.01). The areas below the ROC curves of ESR, CRP, and IL-6 were 76.5%, 76.4%, and 71.8%, respectively, with WBC of only 56.9%. Compared with ESR and CRP, IL-6 displayed a lower sensitivity (ESR vs. CRP vs. IL ? 6 = 72.7% vs. 65.6% vs. 57.5%) but a higher specificity (ESR vs. CRP vs. IL ? 6 = 70.3% vs. 75.4% vs. 83.6%). Serological IL-6 level was influenced by pathogen culture result and pathogen number; nonetheless, bacteria type appeared to have no influence on the levels of the four biomarkers. In short, this study displayed similar value of IL-6 with that of ESR and CRP in assisted diagnosis of FRI.

In this study, variants present in samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified with a RT-qPCR mutation screening kit and were later confirmed by NGS. A sample with an abnormal result was found with the screening test, suggesting the simultaneous presence of two viral populations with different mutations. The DRAGEN Lineage analysis identified the Delta variant, but there was no information about the other three mutations previously detected. When the sequenced data was deeply analyzed, there were reads with differential mutation patterns, that could be identified and classified in terms of relative abundance, whereas only the dominant population was reported by DRAGEN software. Since most of the software developed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 sequences was aimed at obtaining the consensus sequence quickly, the information about viral populations within a sample is scarce.

Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation. CONCLUSION: Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.","output":"Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child C is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P052 Figure 1DiscussionLiver transplant recipients are commonly deficient in Vitamin D, and at high risk of reduced bone density and fragility fractures both pre- and post-transplantation.

Objective: To determine the variation in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school children across districts, schools, grades, and classes, and the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence with self-reported symptoms. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of a longitudinal cohort study (Ciao Corona) from June-July 2020. Setting: 55 randomly selected schools and classes stratified by district in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland (1.5 million inhabitants). Participants: Children, aged 6-16 years old, attending grades 1-2, 4-5 and 7-8. Exposure: Exposure to circulating SARS-CoV-2 between February and June 2020 including public lock-down and school closure (March 16-May 10, 2020). Main Outcomes and Measures: Variation in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children across 12 cantonal districts, schools, and grades using a Luminex-based antibody test with four targets for each of IgG, IgA and IgM. Clustering of cases within classes. Analysis of associations of seropositivity and symptoms. Comparison of seroprevalence with a randomly selected adult population, based on Luminex-based IgG and IgA antibody test of Corona Immunitas. Results: In total, 55 schools and 2585 children were recruited (1337 girls, median age 11, age range 6-16 years). Overall seroprevalence was 2.8 % (95% CI 1.6-4.1%), ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% across districts. Seroprevalence was 3.8% (1.9-6.1%) in grades 1-2, 2.5% (1.1-4.2%) in grades 4-5, and 1.5% (0.5-3.0%) in grades 7-8. At least one case was present in 36/55 tested schools and in 43/128 classes with [a?]50% participation rate and [a?]5 children tested. 73% of children reported COVID-19 compatible symptoms since January 2020, but none were reported more frequently in seropositive compared to seronegative children. Seroprevalence of children was very similar to seroprevalence of randomly selected adults in the same region in June-July 2020, measured with the same Corona Immunitas test, combining IgG and IgA (3.1%, 95% CI 1.4-5.4%, versus 3.3%, 95% CI 1.4-5.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: Seroprevalence was inversely related to age and revealed a dark figure of around 90 when compared to 0.03% confirmed PCR+ cases in children in the same area by end of June. We did not find clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive cases in schools so far, but the follow-up of this school-based study will shed more light on transmission within and outside schools.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who met the Berlin definition and underwent open lung biopsy from January 1999 to January 2014 in a referred medical center. DAD is characterized by hyaline membrane formation, lung edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial cell injury. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, severity of ARDS, clinical and pathological diagnoses, and survival outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1838 patients with ARDS were identified and open lung biopsies were performed on 101 patients (5.5 %) during the study period. Of these 101 patients, the severity of ARDS on diagnosis was mild of 16.8 %, moderate of 56.5 % and severe of 26.7 %. The hospital mortality rate was not significant difference between the three groups (64.7 % vs 61.4 % vs 55.6 %, p = 0.81). Of the 101 clinical ARDS patients with open lung biopsies, 56.4 % (57/101) patients had DAD according to biopsy results. The proportion of DAD were 76.5 % (13/17) in mild, 56.1 % (32/57) in moderate and 44.4 % (12/27) in severe ARDS and there is no significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.113). Pathological findings of DAD patients had a higher hospital mortality rate than non-DAD patients (71.9 % vs 45.5 %, p = 0.007).

Although preterm survival rates have increased in high-income countries, preterm newborns still die because of a lack of adequate newborn care in many low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated global, regional, and national rates of preterm birth in 2014, with trends over time for some selected countries. METHODS We systematically searched for data on preterm birth for 194 WHO Member States from 1990 to 2014 in databases of national civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). We also searched for population-representative surveys and research studies for countries with no or limited CRVS data. For 38 countries with high-quality data for preterm births in 2014, data are reported directly. For countries with at least three data points between 1990 and 2014, we used a linear mixed regression model to estimate preterm birth rates. We also calculated regional and global estimates of preterm birth for 2014. FINDINGS We identified 1241 data points across 107 countries. The estimated global preterm birth rate for 2014 was 106% (uncertainty interval 90-120), equating to an estimated 1484 million (1265 million-1673 million) live preterm births in 2014. 12 0 million (811%) of these preterm births occurred in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Regional preterm birth rates for 2014 ranged from 134% (63-309) in North Africa to 87% (63-133) in Europe. India, China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Indonesia accounted for 579 million (414%) of 1399 million livebirths and 66 million (446%) of preterm births globally in 2014. Of the 38 countries with high-quality data, preterm birth rates have increased since 2000 in 26 countries and decreased in 12 countries. Globally, we estimated that the preterm birth rate was 98% (83-109) in 2000, and 106% (90-120) in 2014.

They are believed to play a central role in evolution, are responsible for various human diseases, and have important contributions to biotechnology and nanotechnology. Viruses undergo evolutionary selection for efficient transmission from host to host by exploiting the hosts gene expression machinery (e.g., ribosomes) for the expression of the genes encoded in their genomes. As a result, viral genes tend to be expressed via non-canonical mechanisms that are very rare in living organisms. Many of the gene expression stages and other aspects of the viral life cycle are encoded in the viral transcripts via silent codes, and are induced by mutations that are synonymous to the viral amino acid content. In a series of studies that included the analyses of dozens of organisms from the three domains of life, it was shown that there are overlapping silent codes in the genetic code that are related to all stages of gene expression regulation.

Our aim was (i) to investigate these cases by the use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and (ii) to determine the specific virulome and resistome of each isolate in order to undertake adequate public health measures. Eleven Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from 11 patients with severe invasive infections between December 13, 2015 and March 12, 2016 were included in our study. Practically, emm-typing, MLST and WGS were used to investigate the relatedness between the isolates. The presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as well as mutations in transcriptional regulators of virulence and in genes encoding for antibiotic targets were assessed. Three and two groups of isolates shared the same emm-type and ST type, respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 14 to 32 SNPs between the strains of the same emm-type group, ruling out the possibility of a clonal outbreak. Mutations found in covS and rocA could partially explain an increased virulence.

METHODS: We examined changes in presentations and referrals to the primary provider of mental health and community health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK (population ~086 million), plus service activity and deaths. We conducted interrupted time series analyses with respect to the time of UK \\"lockdown\\", which was shortly before the peak of COVID-19 infections in this area. We examined changes in standardized mortality ratio for those with and without severe mental illness (SMI). RESULTS: Referrals and presentations to nearly all mental and physical health services dropped at lockdown, with evidence for changes in both supply (service provision) and demand (help-seeking). This was followed by an increase in demand for some services. This pattern was seen for all major forms of presentation to liaison psychiatry services, except for eating disorders, for which there was no evidence of change. Inpatient numbers fell, but new detentions under the Mental Health Act were unchanged. Many services shifted from face-to-face to remote contacts. Excess mortality was primarily in the over-70s. There was a much greater increase in mortality for patients with SMI, which was not explained by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been associated with a system-wide drop in the use of mental health services, with some subsequent return in activity. \\"Supply\\" changes may have reduced access to mental health services for some. \\"Demand\\" changes may reflect a genuine reduction of need or a lack of help-seeking with pent-up demand.

Overprinting is a process in which critical nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing gene can induce the expression of a novel protein by translation of an alternative open reading frame (ORF). Overlapping genes represent an intriguing example of adaptive conflict, because they simultaneously encode two proteins whose freedom to change is constrained by each other. However, overlapping genes are also a source of genetic novelties, as the constraints under which alternative ORFs evolve can give rise to proteins with unusual sequence properties, most importantly the potential for novel functions. Starting with the discovery of overlapping genes in phages infecting Escherichia coli, this review covers a range of studies dealing with detection of overlapping genes in small eukaryotic viruses (genomic length below 30 kb) and recognition of their critical role in the evolution of pathogenicity. Origin of overlapping genes, what factors favor their birth and retention, and how they manage their inherent adaptive conflict are extensively reviewed.

METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis approach was used to comprehensively search MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for relevant studies. Studies that reported psychological stress in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Psychological comorbidities were defined as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Pooled proportions of psychological comorbidities with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using a random-effects model. The quality of assessment for each study, heterogeneity between the studies, and publication bias were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies with 7959 patients/caregivers were included in the meta-analysis.

Field trials with experimental hybrid genotypes were conducted in three consecutive years. In 2017 and 2018, 4- and 6-week-old seedlings were transplanted at four dates: March, April, May and June. In 2019, transplanting dates included April, May and June and seedling age was 5 weeks. In 2018, the March planting experienced severe frost during the initial field period resulting in crop failure. In 2017 and 2019, plants could withstand shorter and less severe frost events. Seedling age did not significantly affect tuber parameters. Transplanting in June resulted in lower marketable yield (> 28 mm) compared with earlier transplanting dates when crops were harvested in September. At full crop senescence, no differences in marketable yield were observed. The optimal transplanting window, taking into account weather-related risks, is approximately between early April and end May. For some genotypes, crop cycle length was observed to be a more important yield-determining factor than transplanting date.

These behaviors and statuses can be approximated by the nearby Bluetooth device count (NBDC) detected by Bluetooth sensors in mobile phones. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the value of the NBDC data in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). METHODS: The data used in this paper included 2886 biweekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom as part of the EU Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) study. From the NBDC data 2 weeks prior to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear features for measuring the periodicity and regularity of individuals life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted Bluetooth features. RESULTS: A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Generally speaking, along with depressive symptom worsening, one or more of the following changes were found in the preceding 2 weeks of the NBDC data: (1) the amount decreased, (2) the variance decreased, (3) the periodicity (especially the circadian rhythm) decreased, and (4) the NBDC sequence became more irregular. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics (R(2)=0.526) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8% of the variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features (R(2)=0.338, RMSE=4.547). CONCLUSIONS: Our statistical results indicate that the NBDC data have the potential to reflect changes in individuals behaviors and statuses concurrent with the changes in the depressive state. The prediction results demonstrate that the NBDC data have a significant value in predicting depressive symptom severity.

We use various methodologies like cross-sectional dependence and the Pesaran-Yamagata slope homogeneity for the diagnostic test. After confirming the diagnosis test, we employ second-generation panel unit root tests, which confirms that all elements are stationary at first difference. The pooled mean group (PMG), Westerlund cointegration, two-step generalised method of moments (GMM), panel fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) model have been used to determine the short-term and long-term association among the variables.

A study conducted at our institution identified that patients were not provided with sufficient information regarding HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC). It was also recognized that patients and their partner felt guilt and stigma about the HPV diagnosis, which had a negative impact on their intimacy. The aim of this project was to create an educational tool to address the concerns of patients and their families with HPV-OPSCC through collaboration of an interprofessional health care team and patient representatives. Methods: As part of the needs assessment, an environmental scan of patient education tools and a literature review on current evidence and management of HPV-OPSCC was conducted, resulting in pamphlets, articles and websites from various cancer centres in North America. Our institutional study was used to identify the patients needs including: more information on the cause of HPV, consequences to their health, and future implications to the health of their partner(s). Three virtual meetings with the development team were conducted to identify the key messages and resources suggested to be included in the educational tool. The principles of lay language and clear design was adhered to in order to ensure the educational tool was acceptable and understandable for patients and their families. Feedback was elicited from stakeholders of the Head and Neck Site Group and the Patient and Family Education Committee. Results: Discussing an HPV diagnosis on top of cancer treatment options can be overwhelming for the patient on their first visit. Furthermore, family members may not be able to accompany the patient to their appointment due to current restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby removing an aspect of support and opportunity for family members to ask questions. This educational tool provides patients and their loved ones answers to common questions regarding HPV-OPSCC, explains how this diagnosis affects their treatment outcomes, and helps patients and family navigate the available resources and supportive services within the cancer centre and on the internet. Challenges identified throughout the project include recruiting patient representatives who felt comfortable sharing their experience, as well as obtaining feedback from a large and diverse team of busy health care professionals. Conclusions: This tool will be in the form of a printed document and will be found on the cancer centre website. Not only was the development of this tool driven by patient need, but patient engagement was prioritized with two patient representatives on the development team to collaborate on the content and design of the education tool. An evaluation of the educational tool will be conducted and may consist of tracking the number of times the educational tool was accessed and administering a survey during the patient's next appointment to determine satisfaction.","output":"Developing Human Papillomavirus Education Material for HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal Cancer Patients with an Interprofessional Health Care Team and Patient Representatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perinatal cardiovascular care has evolved considerably to become its own multidisciplinary field of care.

The article argues that the severity of this failure can only be remedied by breaking out of the discipline's insularity and opening it up to different intellectual crosscurrents from across the entire spectrum of knowledge. It begins by locating the idea of \\"disaster\\" within a broader awareness of the advent of the Anthropocene age and what this implies for the future of the planet. It then reviews some attempts to incorporate this awareness in the concept of \\"sustainability\\" within established disciplines such as economics and discusses the limitations of this approach. The article then turns to \\"globalization\\" and argues that this concept must be significantly enlarged to include various concurrent transformations and their relationship to sustainability. Humanity's collective failure to act decisively on the crucial issue of global warming is then diagnosed as not just a failure of institutions but as stemming from the inadequacy of the concepts that underlie their functioning. After critiquing some of these concepts, the article proposes an alternative approach that would be more appropriate to deal with the question of sustainability and uses the example of the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate this point. An alternative model of governance is also outlined.

Epidemiological studies focused on the influence of outdoor air pollution (AP) on COVID-19 risk have produced inconsistent conclusions. We aimed to quantitatively explore this association using a meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched for studies related to outdoor AP and COVID-19 risk in the Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. No language restriction was utilized. The search date entries were up to August 13, 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with random-/fixed-effects models. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021244656. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. For long-term exposure to AP, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 g/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2); effect size = 1.042, 95% CI 1.017C1.068), particulate matter with diameter <2.5 m (PM(2.5); effect size = 1.056, 95% CI 1.039C1.072), and sulfur dioxide (SO(2); effect size = 1.071, 95% CI 1.002C1.145). The COVID-19 mortality was positively associated with 1 g/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2); effect size = 1.034, 95% CI 1.006C1.063), PM(2.5) (effect size = 1.047, 95% CI 1.025C1.1071). For short-term exposure to air pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 unit increase in air quality index (effect size = 1.001, 95% CI 1.001C1.002), 1 g/m(3) increase NO(2) (effect size = 1.014, 95% CI 1.011C1.016), particulate matter with diameter <10 m (PM(10); effect size = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003C1.008), PM(2.5) (effect size = 1.003, 95% CI 1.002C1.004), and SO(2) (effect size = 1.015, 95% CI 1.007C1.023).

Critics contend that need is difficult to objectively assess, especially considering the risks and uncertainty inherent in health care.

Controlling for other possibly confounding factors, we find that states with bed CONs had 12 percent higher bed utilization rates and 58 percent more days in which more than 70 percent of their beds were used. Individual hospitals in bed CON states were 27 percent more likely to utilize all of their beds. States that relaxed CON requirements to make it easier for hospitals to meet the surge in demand did not experience any statistically significant decreases in bed utilization or number of days above 70 percent of capacity. Nor were hospitals in states that relaxed their CON requirements any less likely to use all their beds.

This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater influents and treated effluents of 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as untreated wastewater from 38 various locations, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May and June 2020. Composite samples collected over twenty-four hours were thermally deactivated for safety, followed by viral concentration using ultrafiltration, RNA extraction using commercially available kits, and viral quantification using RT-qPCR. Furthermore, estimates of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different regions were simulated using Monte Carlo. Results showed that the viral load in wastewater influents from these WWTPs ranged from 7.50E+02 to over 3.40E+04 viral gene copies/L with some plants having no detectable viral RNA by RT-qPCR. The virus was also detected in 85% of untreated wastewater samples taken from different locations across the country, with viral loads in positive samples ranging between 2.86E+02 and over 2.90E+04 gene copies/L. It was also observed that the precautionary measures implemented by the UAE government correlated with a drop in the measured viral load in wastewater samples, which were in line with the reduction of COVID-19 cases reported in the population. Importantly, none of the 11 WWTPs' effluents tested positive during the entire sampling period, indicating that the treatment technologies used in the UAE are efficient in degrading SARS-CoV-2, and confirming the safety of treated re-used water in the country. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater testing has the potential to aid in monitoring or predicting an outbreak location and can shed light on the extent viral spread at the community level.","output":"Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and treated effluents: Surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, members of the Executive Committee of the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) were contacted by members of the IASC from Africa asking whether it would be feasible to establish a new regional IASC section in Africa.

The approval likely depends on whether the proposed new regional section has the potential to conduct typical section activities, such as organizing regional conferences, workshops, and short courses.

However, analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving CoronaVac-induced immunity is still limited. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms behind the adaptive immune response to CoronaVac in a cohort of 50 volunteers immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac. Vaccination with CoronaVac led to an integrated immune response that included several effector arms of the adaptive immune system including specific IgM/IgG, humoral response and other immune response, as well as the innate immune system as shown by complement activation. Metabolites associated with immunity were also identified implicating the role of metabolites in the humoral response, complement activation and other immune response. Networks associated with the TCA cycle and amino acids metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, we constructed a multifactorial response network (MRN) to analyze the underlying interactions and compared the signatures affected by CoronaVac immunization and SARS-CoV-2 infection to further identify immune signatures and related metabolic pathways altered by CoronaVac immunization. These results suggest that protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved via multiple mechanisms and highlights the utility of a systems biology approach in defining molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.","output":"Proteomic and metabolomic signatures associated with the immune response in healthy individuals immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ethnobotanical survey conducted in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu during April to May 2020 showed that the area segregated for home gardens were slowly occupied by the buildings.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional time-series study of clinical virology results from children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Southern Connecticut and areas of New York and Rhode Island. Data collected include demographics, hospital admission, changes in percent positive tests over time, detection intervals in persistently positive children and cycle threshold values. The setting was the Yale New Haven Health System has 6 hospitals at 4 Connecticut locations, 1 hospital in Rhode Island and ambulatory locations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Participants included twenty-three-thousand one-hundred thirty-seven children &#8804; 18 years of age, tested for coronavirus disease 2019 at an ambulatory testing site, the emergency department or on an inpatient unit within the Yale New Haven Health System. RESULTS: Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: An increase in pediatric cases documented in the late summer was predominately due to increased access to testing for children. The percent positivity in children did not change in the first 3 weeks after school opened.

This study aimed to identify personal and professional characteristics of faculty to understand the impact of the pandemic on faculty and consequent policy implications. Methods: A 93-question survey was sent to faculty at a large urban public university and medical center. Demographic, family, and academic characteristics, work distribution and productivity before and during the pandemic, stress, and self-care data information were collected. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify classes of faculty sharing similar characteristics. Comparisons between latent classes were performed using analysis of variance and chi-square analyses. Results: Of 497 respondents, 60% were women. Four latent classes of faculty emerged based on six significant indicator variables. Class 1 individuals were more likely women, assistant professors, nontenured with high work and home stress; Class 2 faculty were more likely associate professors, women, tenured, who reported high home and work stress; Class 3 faculty were more likely men, professors, tenured with moderate work, but low home stress; and Class 4 faculty were more likely adjunct professors, nontenured, and had low home and work stress. Class 2 reported significantly increased administrative and clinical duties, decreased scholarly productivity, and deferred self-care. Conclusions: The pandemic has not affected faculty equally. Early and mid-career individuals were impacted negatively from increased workloads, stress, and decreased self-care.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of an anti-IGF-1R affibody molecule labeled with technetium-99m using cysteine-containing peptide-based chelator GGGC at C-terminus. ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC was efficiently and stably labeled with technetium-99m (radiochemical yield 97  3%).

In multivariate analysis, hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy were significantly associated with absence of both anti-RBD IgGs and anti-spike CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, previous history of COVID-19 in patients receiving MHD correlated with the generation of both types of immune effectors anti-RBD IgG and anti-spike CD8(+) T cells at levels similar to healthy volunteers.

It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. METHODS: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. RESULTS: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. CONCLUSION: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.","output":"CoroNet: A Deep Neural Network for Detection and Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Beijing, the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-2019 has led to a sharp drop in road traffic This provides an opportunity to quantify the contribution rate of road traffic to PM2 5 and NO2 concentrations This paper creatively puts forward the concept of the Maximum Possible Contribution Rate (MPCR) and estimates the MPCR of road traffic to PM2 5 and NO2 by analyzing the daily air pollution data and road traffic data in Beijing from January 24 to March 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019 The findings of this paper include: The decrease in SO2 concentration during the lockdown indicates a reduction in pollutant emissions from industry and households During the lockdown, road traffic in Beijing reduced by 46 9%, while the concentrations of PM2 5 and NO2 in the atmosphere reduced by 5 6% and 29 2% respectively The MPCR of road traffic to PM2 5 and NO2 concentrations are 11 9% and 62 3%, respectively The concentration of O3 did not increase significantly with the decrease of PM2 5 and NO2 concentrations The findings of this paper provide a reference for city managers to evaluate the contribution rate of Beijings road traffic to air pollutants and to formulate reasonable emission reduction policies","output":"COVID-2019 Lockdown in Beijing: A Rare Opportunity to Analyze the Contribution Rate of Road Traffic to Air Pollutants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the lived experience of healthcare staff during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic relating to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and investigate risks associated with PPE use, error mitigation and acceptability of mindfulness incorporation into PPE practice.

Patients newly diagnosed with PCa were identified from national rapid cancer registration data linked to other electronic healthcare datasets. RESULTS: There was a 30.8% reduction (22 419 vs 32 409) in the number of men with newly diagnosed PCa in 2020 after the start of the first lockdown, compared with the corresponding period in 2019.

However, the role of PPR signaling in those cells during aging has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of PTH signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes during aging. Mice lacking PPR in osteocyte (Dmp1-PPRKO) display an age-dependent osteopenia characterized by a significant decrease in osteoblast activity and increase in osteoclast number and activity. At the molecular level, the absence of PPR signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes is associated with an increase in serum sclerostin and a significant increase in osteocytes expressing 4-hydroxy-2-nonenals, a marker of oxidative stress. In Dmp1-PPRKO mice there was an age-dependent increase in p16Ink4a/Cdkn2a expression, whereas it was unchanged in controls. In vitro studies demonstrated that PTH protects osteocytes from oxidative stress-induced cell death. In summary, we reported that PPR signaling in osteocytes is important for protecting the skeleton from age-induced bone loss by restraining osteoclast's activity and protecting osteocytes from oxidative stresses.","output":"Parathyroid hormone signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes protects mice from age-related bone loss."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite of the impact that viruses have on aquatic organisms, relatively little is known on how fish fight against these infections.

In a quest for such bn Abs, phage- and yeast-displayed antibody libraries, constructed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a patient with bn serum containing Abs targeting the epitope of the bn MAb 2F5, were panned against peptides containing the 2F5 epitope and against the HIV-1 gp140(JR-FL).

Binding of both MAbs to gp41 alanine substitution mutant peptides required the DKW(664-666) core of the 2F5 epitope and two additional upstream residues (L(660,663)). The MAbs have long (21-residue) heavy-chain third complementarity-determining regions (CDR-H3s), and m66.6 (but not m66) exhibited polyspecific reactivity to self- and non-self-antigens.

In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. MATERIAL: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. RESULTS: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71%, respectively). Approximatively, 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. CONCLUSION: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement). Urologists must anticipate for lockdown exit in order to catch-up delayed surgeries.

ACEs, associated with negative health behaviors and chronic health disorders, disproportionately impact people from poor and marginalized communities. Toxic stress from ACEs can be prevented and treated with trauma-informed care. Inadequate training prevents the maternal and child workforce from providing evidence-based trauma-informed care. Cross-sector collaboration between pediatric care sectors is crucial to providing systems-wide trauma-informed care, but significant barriers impede cross sector communication. Training and formal cross-sector communication networks are needed to create strong systems of trauma-informed care in communities. The Stanford ACEs Aware ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) program was created with 3 workforce development goals: 1) introduce the California Office of Surgeon General-led ACEs Aware Initiative to the maternal and child health workforce in 3 California counties, 2) disseminate trauma-informed evidence-based best practices, 3) bridge community silos to increase collaboration between care sectors to promote trauma-informed care systems. Methods Participants were recruited from Federally Qualified Health Centers, county public health departments, community behavioral health organizations, educational institutions, and agencies that serve low-income children and families. 100 unique participants representing 3 counties and 54 agencies joined sessions. Twelve virtual educational sessions were convened over 6 months using the Project ECHO model via Zoom technology. Sessions consisted of didactic lectures and whole-group case-based discussions. Results After completing the educational series, participants expressed commitment to increased cross-sector collaboration, and reported increased knowledge and confidence in using trauma-informed skills. After participation, a significant number of participants had also completed another recommended California ACEs Aware Initiative online training. Conclusion An ECHO series of virtual workforce development sessions on trauma-informed best practices promoted cross-sector communication and was associated with strong participant engagement and satisfaction. The educational series increased knowledge and confidence in use of evidence-based trauma-informed best practices.","output":"Community ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Project Promotes Cross-Sector Collaboration and Evidence-Based Trauma-Informed Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The worldwide coronavirus pandemic in 2020 radically changed the landscape of psychology service provision and training, with rapid rollouts of telemedicine to promote safe access to care.

However, current diagnosis of depression relies on questionnaires that are highly correlated with physician experience and hence not completely objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals combined with deep learning techniques may be an objective approach to effective diagnosis of MDD. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework for MDD diagnosis based on EEG signals. We used EEG signals from 29 healthy subjects and 24 patients with severe depression to calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Kappa coefficient, which were 90.98%, 91.27%, 90.59%, and 81.68%, respectively. In addition, we found that these values were highest when happy-neutral face pairs were used as stimuli for detecting depression. Compared with exiting methods for EEG-based MDD classification, ours can maintain stable model performance without re-calibration. The present results suggest that the method is highly accurate for diagnosis of MDD and can be used to develop an automatic plug-and-play EEG-based system for diagnosing depression.","output":"An End-to-End Depression Recognition Method Based on EEGNet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toxic metals (such as lead, cadmium, and, to a lesser extent, aluminum) are detrimental to health when ingested in food or water or when inhaled.

The rapid diagnosis of EI is essential to reduce the disease spread. Many rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for diagnosing human influenza are available, but their ability to diagnose EI has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 22 RAD tests in the diagnosis of EI. METHODS: The 22 RAD tests were performed on fivefold serial dilutions of EI virus to determine their detection limits. The four most sensitive RAD tests (ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B\\\\N) were further evaluated using nasopharyngeal samples collected from experimentally infected and naturally infected horses. The results were compared to those obtained using molecular tests. RESULTS: The detection limits of the 22 RAD tests varied hugely. Even the four RAD tests showing the best sensitivity were 125\\\\fold less sensitive than the molecular techniques. The duration of virus detection in the experimentally infected horses was shorter using the RAD tests than using the molecular techniques.

Given rapid changes in healthcare, it is essential that medical students develop into MALs. There is a need for an instrument that can capture MAL behaviors and characteristics. The objective of this study was to develop an instrument for measuring the MAL process in medical students and evaluate its psychometric properties. METHODS: As part of curriculum evaluation, 818 students completed previously developed instruments with validity evidence including the Self-Regulated Learning Perception Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, Goal Orientation Scale, and Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning. The authors performed exploratory factor analysis to examine underlying relationships between items. Items with high factor loadings were retained. Cronbachs alpha was computed. In parallel, the multi-institutional research team rated the same items to provide content validity evidence of the items to MAL model. RESULTS: The original 67 items were reduced to 28 items loading onto four factors: Planning, Learning, Resilience, and Motivation. Each subscale included the following number of items and Cronbachs alpha: Planning (10 items, alpha = 0.88), Learning (6 items, alpha = 0.81), Resilience (6 items, alpha = 0.89), and Motivation (6 items, alpha = 0.81). The findings from the factor analyses aligned with the research team ratings of linkage to the components of MAL.

For effective inactivation strategies, design and implementation, knowledge of UVC wavelength sensitivity, and disinfection rate of the relevant pathogen are required. This study aimed to determine the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC irradiation with different wavelengths. Specifically, the study determined dosage, inactivation levels, and wavelength sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA/WA1-2020) inactivation at peak wavelengths of 259, 268, 270, 275 and 280 nm was performed using a plaque assay method. A UVC dose of 3.1 mJ/cm2 using 259 and 268 nm arrays yielded log reduction values (LRV) of 2.32 and 2.44, respectively. With a dose of 5 mJ/cm2, arrays of peak wavelengths at 259 and 268 nm obtained similar inactivation levels (LRV 2.97 and 2.80 respectively). The arrays of longer wavelength (270, 275 and 280 nm), demonstrated lower performances ([]LRV 2.0) when applying an irradiation dose of 5 mJ/cm2. Additional study with the 268 nm array revealed that a dose of 6.25 mJ/cm2 is enough to obtain a LRV of 3. These results suggest that 259 and 268 nm are the most efficient wavelengths for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation compared to longer UVC wavelengths, allowing the calculation of disinfection systems efficacy.","output":"Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC reveals wavelength sensitivity contributes towards rapid virucidal activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keywords: Falls, Quality Improvement, Innovation Purpose: The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive falls assessment & management plan based on the NICE falls guidelines standards (2013). This included provision of a multifactorial falls risk assessment and intervention plan. The project aim was for a comprehensive falls assessment & management plan to form part of the care delivered for 75% of all over 65 year olds whom are referred to the Acute & Emergency Medicine Therapy Team by December 2020. The secondary objectives were to improve staff knowledge and confidence with assessing falls and onwards management. Methods: The project followed a quality improvement methodology, with an initial pre-project gathering of literature, staff feedback through local focus groups and patient feedback before a team teaching launching the project. Following staff feedback, the project had three primary drivers of: documentation, knowledge & skills, and onwards management. Data has been continuously collected from fifteen patients a week and compared to the NICE Falls Guidelines (2013) since August 2020. Several PDSA cycles were launched including a falls assessment template within the therapy team, consistent of all of the components of the Nice Falls guidelines and created collaboratively with the team a local falls teaching programme was also created based on a local team learning needs assessment. Other change ideas included provision of falls community services decision support tool, regular team project promotion, local team breakdown projects and provision of falls leaflets. Results: Since the launch of the falls QI project there has been a consistent 10% increase in the compliance to the NICE falls guidelines (2013) across both the St Mary's Acute and Emergency Team and Charing Cross A&E Team. The improvement in the compliance to the NICE guidelines were sustained during the second wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic. On average the compliance to the audited standards has been 45-50%, with 40% uptake of the new assessment template. Staff Knowledge and confidence in assessing falls has also increased since the start of the project by 10%. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the falls QI project resulted in an increase in multifactorial falls assessments completed for patients seen by the Imperial Acute & Emergency Medicine Team, with improvements in staff knowledge and confidence through the project interventions. The project was sustainable during the COVID-pandemic despite the additional time pressures and therefore demonstrates the usability of the documentation template. Impact: The impact of this project is improved patient-centred excellent care, which has improved staff knowledge and competencies.

The classification-based quantitative structureCactivity relationship (QSAR) models were generated between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory activities and different descriptors. Identification of structural fingerprints to increase or decrease in the inhibitory activity was mapped for possible inclusion/exclusion of these fingerprints in the lead optimization process. Challenges in ADME properties of protease inhibitors were also discussed to overcome the problems of oral bioavailability.

One prominent criticism of category of human rights which includes the human right to health is that it is difficult, to assign the duties that correspond to these rights, because of stark disparity in how the main duty bearers approach their duties. METHODS: This paper adopts a doctrinal approach to examine and evaluate the duties to the right to health. The method in this study entails a detailed literature search to systematically evaluate the legal implications, regulations, arguments and policy regarding the nature of the obligation to the right to health. This study also engages with normative and philosophical aspects of human rights. RESULTS: This paper posits that human rights protect against common, serious, and remediable threats and risks, and ensure that there are remedies from governments and third parties. However, it is difficult to compel duties especially in regard to the right to health. First it is not easy to achieve a uniform standard for duty bearers implied by the words highest attainable physical and mental health. Theorists discussed in the paper outline views of what this could mean, from serious to common health concerns. Second, the right to health is not a legally established right in many jurisdictions, making it difficult to enforce. This paper outlines different layers of state and non-state legal duty bearers to enforce the right to health. CONCLUSION: The duty to respect, protect, fulfil and even remedy the right to health, will often be meaningless in practice without a clear identification of the necessary duty bearers to enforce them. The law is the starting point for this to not only enshrine this right as a legally enforceable one but also to clearly identify duty bearers. Without this, the human right to health as outlined under international and regional human rights law generates an implausible, or even impossible, profusion of duties. There remains much work still to be done especially on the moral and legal fronts in order to fully guarantee this right.

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. Using all genomic sequences collected from patients with a travel link to Iran, we estimate that the epidemic started on 21/01/2020 (95% HPD: 05/12/2019-14/02/2020) with a doubling time of 3 days (95% HPD: 1.68-16.27). We also show, using air travel data from confirmed exported cases, that from late February to early March the number of active cases across the country were more than a hundred times higher than the reported cases at the time. A detailed province-level analysis of all-cause mortality shows 20,718 (CI 95%: 18,859-22,576) excess deaths during winter and spring 2020 compared to previous years, almost twice the number of reported COVID-19-related deaths at the time. Correcting for under-reporting of prevalence and deaths, we use an SEIR model to reconstruct the outbreak dynamics in Iran. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggests that by 14/07/2020 a total of 9M (CI 95%: 118K-44M) have recovered from the disease across the country.

METHODS Between June and December 2014, 173 patients with Crohn's disease and 121 with ulcerative colitis were treated with vedolizumab. Patients were followed until week 54. EIM activity was assessed at weeks 0, 6, 14, 22, 30 and 54 by using a 3-step scale: complete remission, partial response and no response. RESULTS At baseline, 49 (16.7%) patients had EIMs of which 47 had inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis, four had cutaneous lesions and two had both rheumatologic and skin EIM. At week 54, 21 (44.7%) patients had complete remission for inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis and three (75%) for cutaneous EIM. In multivariate analysis, complete remission of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis was associated with clinical remission of IBD (OR = 1.89, IC95% [1.05-3.41], P = .03) and recent onset of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis (OR = 1.99, IC95% [1.12-3.52], P = .02). During the follow-up period, 34 (13.8%) patients without any EIM at baseline, developed incident cases of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis consisting mostly of peripheral arthralgia without evidence of arthritis and 14 (4.8%) incident cases of paradoxical skin manifestation.

One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.","output":"Shorter telomere lengths in patients with severe COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent and extensive research activity highlighted the process behind the attack and spread of COVID-19 in the human body What emerged is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus makes use of both the ACE2 receptor, expressed by pneumocytes in the ephitelial alveolar lining, and by the endothelium to spread the disease and to replicate itself Since the endothelium is an extended tissue lying in the circulatory system, this may lead to a large state of diffuse endothelial inflammation with serious clinical consequences This situation may be further compromised by the immune system, that may generate pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) as a consequence of the infection In this paper we propose and analyze a molecular communication system, designed for the detection of excessive IL-6 level, that allows monitoring its evolution in the blood vessels The proposed analysis was performed by using the BiNS2 simulator, which is suitable for the numerical analysis of flow-based molecular communications in blood vessels, as well as Markov models of the endothelium IEEE","output":"A molecular communications system for the detection of inflammatory levels related to COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Historically, reducing aerosol-based transmission of respired viruses in indoor environments has been of importance for controlling influenza viruses and common-cold rhinoviruses. The present public health emergency associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes this topic critically important. Yet to be tested is the potential effectiveness of simple interventions that create an isolation zone (IZ) for a suspected/confirmed sick or sensitive person requiring quarantine. The intent in existing homes is to find a practical means to mitigate exposure to airborne contaminants. In creating an IZ in an occupied single-family home in the study, four simple strategies were tested. The test configurations were: (1) IZ windows closed with IZ bathroom exhaust ventilation fan off, (2) IZ windows closed with IZ exhaust fan on, (3) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan off, and (4) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan on. Incense-generated fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) was used as a marker for virus transmission. The measured transfer of PM(2.5) from the IZ into the main zone (MZ) of the house enabled us to determine the relative effectiveness of four containment strategies. Collectively, the data from pressure differential (across zones) and PM(2.5) measurements suggested that the best containment strategy was achieved through continuously operating the bathroom exhaust fan while keeping the windows closed in the IZ (configuration 2). Interventions using open windows were found to be less reliable, due to variability in wind speed and direction, resulting in an unpredictable and sometimes detrimental pressure differential in the IZ with reference to MZ. Our findings strongly suggest a simple IZ exhaust ventilation strategy has the potential for mitigating the risk from the airborne spread of contaminants, such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Mitigation of Airborne Contaminant Spread through Simple Interventions in an Occupied Single-Family Home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of euthyroid sick syndrome among patients with COVID-19, and the relationship between the possible change in free-triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine (fT3/fT4) ratio and the biochemical parameters used during the follow-up of COVID-19. Material and Methods: A total of 114 sequential patients between 18-65 years of age, who were treated in the internal medicine service allocated to patients with COVID-19, were included in the study. fT3, fT4, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroglobulin antibodies antibody levels were analyzed. fT3/fT4 ratio was calculated. Results: According to the results, only isolated low fT3 levels were found in 39.5% (45/114) of the patients, while 25.4% (29/114) had both low TSH and fT3 levels, 31.6% (36/114) had autoimmune thyroid disease, and 3.5% (4/114) had normal results in the thyroid function tests. The fT3/fT4 ratio was also determined to be low in all groups. However, no significant correlation was found between the low fT3/fT4 ratio and the parameters used in monitoring COVID-19.

METHODS: Between March 2020 and May 2020, patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU were enrolled in this study. Upon discharge, patients were telephoned and asked to complete a survey related to taste and smell impairment. Characteristics were compared between patients with and without taste and/or smell impairment. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled (mean age, 61.32  12.53 years; mean ICU stay, 10.19  10.24 days). Age, sex, type/number of comorbid diseases, most ICU support modalities, and ICU stay duration did not significantly differ between groups. Patients in group B required more high-flow nasal oxygen therapy than patients in group A (P = .010). In total, 22 (42.3%) of 52 patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment. Three patients experienced isolated smell impairment and one patient experienced isolated taste impairment. Among the 21 patients who experienced smell impairment, 18 (85.78%) experienced hyposmia (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score: 6.33  0.97), while 3 (14.28%) experienced anosmia. Among the 19 patients who experienced taste impairment, 16 (84.22%) experienced hypogeusia (mean VAS score: 6.43  1.03) and 3 (15.78%) experienced ageuisa.

Previous studies have shown that occupational exposure to acid mist or acidic solutions is a major risk factor for oral diseases. However, the findings are inconsistent and do not consider individual factors and lifestyles that may cause the same oral diseases. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive oral health survey and collected detail information to confirm the effect of acidic solution exposure on worker's oral health. METHODS From 4 acidic solution factories, a total of 309 subjects (157 in control and 152 in exposed group) was enrolled. All participants competed oral examinations and self-report questionnaire, including the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index, community periodontal index (CPI), loss of attachment (LA) index, and tooth erosion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between the acidic solution exposure and oral health. RESULTS The results showed that acid exposure was correlated with soft oral tissue injury rather than hard oral tissue in our survey. In the multivariate model (adjusted for sex, age, worked years, education level, mouthwash use, dental floss use, tooth brushing, mask use, smoking, drinking, chewing areca and dietary habits with acidic foods), significant relationships of acid exposure with LA score were observed (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.03-5.26). However, the presence of acid exposure was not significantly associated with tooth erosion, DMFT, and CPITN.

Risk assessment and prevention measures adopted were described. Geo-spatial epidemiological analysis of the outbreak was reported. Significant gaps in the knowledge of self-protection measures from contagious diseases and in the perception of the pandemic risk were observed in migrants; health promotion activities, targeted to remove cultural barriers and improve behaviors appropriate to individual protection, were able to fulfill this gap. In low-resource settings, especially in closed communities, the implementation of social distancing strategies, the systematic use of individual protection devices, and active syndromic surveillance are essential tools to limit the risk of outbreaks. In the event of an outbreak, it is relevant to rapidly activate containment procedures based on systematic screening, isolation, and quarantine, taking into consideration the limits of tracing contacts within a closed community. Not being able to trace certain contacts, the geo-spatial epidemiological analysis of cases distribution could be key in the management of the outbreak.

INTERVENTIONS Three-, 12-, and 60-mL syringes (Kendall Monoject) with extension tubing were mounted in identical Baxter AS50 infusion pumps. We determined time to alarm after occlusion of the distal tubing. We described and validated a method using capillary tubes to determine startup time to reach steady-state flow and variability of steady-state flow. Data were analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance or linear regression, as appropriate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS At 5 mL/hr flow, time to alarm occlusion (mean +/- sd) was 1:08 +/- 0:42, 3:35 +/- 0:58, and 27:06 +/- 3:26 minutes for 3-, 12-, and 60-mL syringes, respectively (p < .00001). At a lower flow of 0.2 mL/hr, none of the pumps alarmed despite 30 mins of distal occlusion, regardless of syringe size. Validation testing of the capillary tube volumetric method revealed a sd <5% of the average fluid column displacement. Startup time to reach steady-state flow of 0.2 mL/hr for 60-mL syringes was 76 +/- 40 mins and significantly exceeded 24 +/- 10 mins for 3-mL syringes (p = .041). In one test using a 60-mL syringe, flow remained below 20% of steady state for >3 hrs. Average steady-state flow was similar for the three syringe sizes (p = .2861), but sd of steady-state flow was directly related to syringe size and regressed to a line with r = 1.

Although this response was well intended, many believed it advanced childrens vulnerability to abuse and neglect. This article interrogates these concerns. It investigates how C-19 legislation enabled, or constrained, South African childrens protection from abuse and neglect and appraises the findings from a social-ecological resilience perspective with the aim of advancing child protection in times of emergency. METHOD: The authors conducted a rapid review of the legislation, directives and regulations pertaining to South Africas strict lockdown (15 March to 31 May 2020). They searched two databases (SA Government platform and LexisNexus) and identified 140 documents for potential inclusion. Following full-text screening, 17 documents were reviewed. Document analysis was used to extract relevant themes. FINDINGS: The regulations and directives that informed South Africas strict lockdown offered three protective pathways. They (i) limited C-19 contagion and championed physical health; (ii) ensured uninterrupted protection (legal and statutory) for children at risk of abuse; and (iii) advanced social protection measures available to disadvantaged households. CONCLUSION: C-19 legislation has potential to advance childrens protection from abuse and neglect during emergency times. However, this potential will be curtailed if C-19 legislation is inadequately operationalised and/or prioritises physical health to the detriment of childrens intellectual, emotional, social and security needs. To overcome such risks, social ecologies must work with legislators to co-design and co-operationalise C-19 legislation that will not only protect children, but advance their resilience.","output":"Child protection and resilience in the face of COVID-19 in South Africa: A rapid review of C-19 legislation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction While the general uptake of e-mental health interventions remained low over the past years, physical distancing and lockdown measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic created a need and demand for online consultations in only a matter of weeks Objective This study investigates the uptake of online consultations provided by mental health professionals during lockdown measures in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the participating countries, with a specific focus on professionals' motivations and perceived barriers regarding online consultations Methods An online survey on the use of online consultations was set up in March 2020 The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) guided the deductive qualitative analysis of the results Results In total, 2082 mental health professionals from Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden were included The results showed a high uptake of online consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic but limited previous training on this topic undergone by mental health professionals Most professionals reported positive experiences with online consultations, but concerns about the performance of online consultations in a mental health context (e g , in terms of relational aspects) and practical considerations (e g , relating to privacy and security of software) appear to be major barriers that hinder implementation Conclusions This study provides an overview of the mental health professionals' actual needs and concerns regarding the use of online consultations in order to highlight areas of possible intervention and allow the implementation of necessary governmental, educational, and instrumental support so that online consultation can become a feasible and stable option in mental healthcare","output":"Online consultations in mental healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak: An international survey study on professionals' motivations and perceived barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the health campaign of COVID-19 using the extended parallel process model (EPPM) theory.

Researchers have suggested that COVID-19 death characteristics (e.g., intensive care admission, unexpected death) and circumstances (e.g., secondary stressors, social isolation) will precipitate a worldwide increase of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD). Yet, no study has investigated this. Since acute grief is a strong predictor of future pathological grief, we compared grief levels among people recently bereaved due to COVID-19, natural, and unnatural causes. METHODS: People bereaved through COVID-19 (n = 49), natural causes (n = 1182), and unnatural causes (n = 210), completed self-report measures of demographic and loss-related characteristics and PGD and PCBD symptoms. RESULTS: COVID-19 bereavement yielded higher symptom levels of PGD (d = 0.42) and PCBD (d = 0.35) than natural bereavement (but not unnatural bereavement). Effects held when limiting analyses to recent losses and those who participated during the pandemic. Expectedness of the death explained this effect. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include using a convenience sample and self-report measures. CONCLUSIONS: Higher grief levels occur among people bereaved due to COVID-19 compared to people bereaved due to natural loss.

RESULTS: We included 34 articles with 412 pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2), with an average age of 27.5 years of age and 36.0 gestational weeks. The most common symptom was fever (205 [49.7%]), and 89 (21.6%) pregnant women progressed to severe viral pneumonia. Laboratory tests showed an increase in C-reactive protein (154 [37.8%]), and radiological tests showed pneumonia with peripheral ground-glass pattern (172 [51.4%]). Emergency cesarean delivery was indicated for most pregnant women, and the most common gestational complication was premature rupture of ovarian membranes (14 [3.4%;]). We detected 2 (0.5%) neonatal deaths, 2 (0.5%) stillbirths, and 1 (0.2%) maternal death. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with COVID-19 presented a clinical picture similar to that of non-infected pregnant women, with few obstetric or neonatal repercussions. There was a greater indication of cesarean deliveries before the disease aggravated, and there was no evidence of vertical transmission of the infection.","output":"Clinical and Obstetric Aspects of Pregnant Women with COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the current situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic with particular regard to seafarers and with the indications drawn up by the Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (C.I.R.M.) in this regard.","output":"Coronavirus variant COVID-19 pandemic: a report to seafarers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Combined autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare disease that can present as extremely low neutrophil count and platelet count, respectively [1] Case Presentation: We describe the first case, to the authors' knowledge, of the novel SARS CoV-2 infection and combined AIN and ITP in a healthy 27-year-old male Conclusion: Viruses have been known to trigger autoimmune diseases in people with genetic predisposition We speculate that the patient's selective IgM deficiency predisposed him to have autoimmune cytopenia, and SARS-COV-2 triggered him to acquire combined AIN and ITP Our hypothesis is supported by a lack of evidence of malignancy, a normal morphology on the smear, and an immediate response to IVIG infusion with significant improvement in platelet and neutrophilic count","output":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 and combined autoimmune neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings in cancer versus non-cancer patients with COVID-19 infection. We sought to assess the correlation between radiologic patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia, clinical course, and outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of COVID-19 positive cancer and non-cancer pts who had chest CT scans at the time of diagnosis, at our hospital and 16 other centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America, between March, 2020 and November, 2020. Patients age, underlying diseases, symptoms, laboratory studies, and radiologic findings consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs), multifocal organizing pneumonia (MOP) were collected in association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 426 pts with cancer and 622 non-cancer pts. Thereafter, cancer pts were analyzed into 3 distinct groups and similar to non-cancer pts: GGOs group (n=224, 54%), GGOs+MOP group (n=61, 14.6%), and a third group of neither GGOs or MOP (n=131, 31.4%) in cancer pts, and in non-cancer pts: GGOs group (n=387, 62.8%), GGOs +MOP group (n=100, 16.2%), and a third group of neither GGOs or MOP (n=129, 21%). The median patients age was 54 in non-cancer pts vs 62 in cancer pts (p< 0.001) and there were more males in the non-cancer group 57% vs 47% (p=0.001). Cough was more prevalent in non-cancer pts, 71% vs 59% (p< 0.001) and similar to fever (73% vs 57%, p< 0.001). Neutropenia < 0.5 k/L and lymphocytopenia < 1 k/L were more frequent in cancer pts (p< 0.001). In cancer pts, there was no statistically significance difference between the 3 groups (hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, readmission within 30 days, and mortality), except pts who required non-invasive (NI) ventilation were more frequent in the GGOs group, 55% (p=0.005). In non-cancer, pts with GGOs +MOP have higher hospital admission, ICU transfer, NI- and mechanical ventilation compared to the 2 other groups (p< 0.001). While readmission to hospital or mortality rate within 30 days were similar between the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that non-cancer pts tended to have more radiologic findings on chest CT scan compared to cancer pts at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and were associated with more worrisome COVID-19-related clinical outcomes.

Cleavage of HA by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity, and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 has been identified as an HA activator in cell culture and in the infected host. However, it is less clear whether TMPRSS2-related enzymes can also activate HA for spread in target cells. Moreover, the activity of cellular serine protease inhibitors against HA-activating TTSPs is poorly understood. Here, we show that TMPRSS11A, another member of the TTSP family, cleaves and activates the influenza A virus (FLUAV) HA and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S). Moreover, we demonstrate that TMPRSS11A is expressed in murine tracheal epithelium, which is a target of FLUAV infection, and in human trachea, suggesting that the protease could support FLUAV spread in patients. Finally, we show that HA activation by the TMPRSS11A-related enzymes human airway tryptase and DESC1, but not TMPRSS11A itself, is blocked by the cellular serine protease inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1). Our results suggest that TMPRSS11A could promote FLUAV spread in target cells and that HA-activating TTSPs exhibit differential sensitivity to blockade by cellular serine protease inhibitors.","output":"TMPRSS11A activates the influenza A virus hemagglutinin and the MERS coronavirus spike protein and is insensitive against blockade by HAI-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19-related public health control measures have necessitated a rapid transition in healthcare delivery. We qualitatively explored clinicians and patients experiences of the pandemics impact on the delivery and receipt of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) care. METHODS: Between September and December 2020, we conducted ten 90-minute virtual focus groups with sleep clinicians (n=19) and English and Spanish-speaking patients with OSA (n= 30) recruited through an urban academic sleep clinic, national organizations, social media, and snowball sampling. An interdisciplinary team conducted a rapid qualitative analysis that included prefigured and emergent domains. The team developed a comprehensive analytic matrix, identifying key themes within and between groups and triangulating them across participant types. RESULTS: Clinicians and patients across all groups confirmed a rapid shift to the adoption of telemedicine. Clinicians reported telemedicine enhanced evaluations by enabling direct observation of the home environment, providing opportunities to guide patients on medical equipment used in the home, and cultivating meaningful social connections for patients. Perceived benefits varied across patient subgroups (age, language, technological self-efficacy). The majority of clinicians reported that telemedicines initial uptake resulted in delays in care and revenue loss, but sustained use was thought to be feasible over time. Patients reported delays in care related to the pandemics disruption on healthcare and their personal safety concerns. Additionally, telemedicines adoption directly altered other elements of care, including the delivery of patient education materials and loss of tacit information gained during the in-person visit. All groups reported adequate mask fitting as a central challenge for patients using positive airway pressure therapy. Spanish-speaking patients noted concerns of increased difficulty accessing care and navigating the OSA care system due to limited English proficiency, in addition to the limited availability of OSA resources in Spanish. CONCLUSION: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rapid adoption of telemedicine largely facilitated OSA care but altered patient-clinician interactions, delivery of patient education materials, and mask fitting success. Given that telemedicine will likely be sustained post-pandemic, there are needs for targeted efforts aimed at addressing disparities in telemedicine, enhancing practitioner telepresence and education, and new approaches for mask fitting to ensure successful OSA care.

Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive electrochemical immunoassay capable of quantitatively detecting the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patient nasopharyngeal samples using stencil-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) functionalized with capture antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). Samples are added to the electrode surface, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibodies also targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The concentration of the virus in samples is quantified using chronoamperometry in the presence of 3,35,5-tetramethylbenzidine. Limits of detection equivalent to less than 50 plaque forming units/mL (PFU/mL) were determined with virus sample volumes of 20 L. No cross-reactivity was detected with the influenza virus and other coronavirus N proteins. Patient nasopharyngeal samples were tested as part of a proof-of-concept clinical study where samples were also tested using the gold-standard real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method. Preliminary results from a data set of 22 samples demonstrated a clinical specificity of 100% (n = 9 negative samples according to RT-qPCR) and a clinical sensitivity of 70% for samples with RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values under 30 (n = 10) and 100% for samples with Ct values under 25 (n = 5), which complies with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for POC COVID-19 diagnostic tests.

This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020. RESULTS We received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism. CONCLUSION Physicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment.

In this study, we investigated if pentoxifylline (PTX) and ethosuximide could potentially alleviate abdominal pain in patients with IBS treated with mebeverine. METHODS: We recruited 150 patients from Tanta University Hospital to this randomized, prospective, and double blinded study. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 50). Group 1 (mebeverine) received 135 mg mebeverine three times/day (t.i.d). Group 2 (ethosuximide group) received 135 mg mebeverine t.i.d plus 250 mg ethosuximide twice daily (b.i.d) and group 3 (PTX group) received 135 mg mebeverine t.i.d plus 400 mg PTX b.i.d. Patients were assessed by a gastroenterologist at baseline and 6 months after therapy. Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, tumor necrosis- (TNF-), fecal myeloperoxidase, and fecal neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were measured before and after therapy. The numeric pain rating scale (NRS) was also assessed before and after therapy. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Reduced NRS scores and abdominal pain relief. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Decreased inflammatory biomarkers. RESULTS: After 6 months, groups 2 and 3 showed a significantly greater reduction in serum IL-8, IL-6, TNF-, fecal myeloperoxidase, and fecal NGAL levels when compared to group 1 after therapy.

Clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics of PH before COVID-19 were collected from the French PH registry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 211 PH patients (including 123 PAH, 47 CTEPH and 41 other groups of PH) experienced COVID-19 and 40.3% of them were outpatients, 32.2% were hospitalized on a conventional ward and 27.5% in ICU. Among hospitalized patients (n=126), 54.0% received corticosteroids, 37.3% high-flow oxygen and 11.1% invasive ventilation. Right ventricular and acute renal failure occurred in 30.2% and 19.8% of patients, respectively. Fifty-two patients (all hospitalized) died from COVID-19. Overall mortality was 24.6% (IC95 18.8-30.5) and in-hospital mortality 41.3% (IC95 32.7-49.9). Non-survivors were significantly older, more frequently male, with comorbidities (diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, systemic hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases, chronic renal failure) and had more severe PH at their most recent evaluation preceding COVID-19 diagnosis (in terms of functional class and 6-minute walk distance) (all P<0.05). Use of PAH therapy was similar between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in patients with precapillary PH was associated with a high in-hospital mortality.

However, little is known about the prevalence or genetic diversity of porcine orthoreoviruses in South Korea. We examined 237 diarrheic fecal samples collected from 78 pig farms around the country. RT-PCR utilizing primers specific for the L1 gene of mammalian orthoreoviruses showed that 45 (19.0%) samples were positive. The 10 strains isolated from orthoreovirus-positive samples formed typical perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and had an atypical hemagglutination pattern; these are characteristics of type 3 orthoreovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene in these 10 Korean and other strains showed that type 3 orthoreoviruses could be divided into four lineages; the 10 Korean strains were included in porcine lineage IV, along with T3/porcine/Sichuan/2006. Sequence analysis showed that strains in lineage IV had nucleotide identities of 97.0C98.1% and deduced amino acid identities of 96.4C98.2%. Sequence analysis of the 1 protein, a viral attachment protein, revealed that the amino acid sequences associated with neurotropism (amino acids 198C204, 249I, 350D, and 419E) were highly conserved among the Korean strains, confirming that neural tropism was present. In conclusion, our findings suggest that porcine orthoreovirus infections are endemic in pig farms in South Korea and that the 10 novel Korean porcine orthoreoviruses belong to porcine lineage IV of type 3 orthoreovirus.

A fellowship in physician wellness provides structured opportunity for the development of expertise in the science and administration of physician wellness through a tailored curriculum and academic scholarship. Background Currently, limited opportunities exist to pursue formal wellness training in graduate medical education. This lack of specific training may make the path to expertise and leadership in physician wellness difficult. Objective Our objective was to design and implement a physician wellness fellowship in a Department of Emergency Medicine. Completion of this fellowship, with ongoing professional development, will give physicians the skills to fill various leadership roles within the house of medicine, such as chief wellness officer, department, organization, or national wellness leader, or wellness consultant. Development Process The fellowship curriculum was developed according to Kern?s six-step approach with expert consultation. The Stanford WellMD?Model of Professional?Fulfillment was used as a framework to define the core content. The curriculum has five principal components developed utilizing competency-based education in medicine: dissemination of knowledge (teaching), clinical, educational foundation, implementation (administrative), and critical investigation (research). Implementation Phase The physician wellness fellowship was implemented for the academic year 2019-2020. The fellow completed all the required fellowship activities. In addition, the fellow completed the American College of Emergency Physician?s teaching fellowship program.

Methods Cats with pleural, abdominal or pericardial effusion were prospectively enrolled. Cats were classified as having or not having FIP based on immunohistochemistry (if available) or a sophisticated statistical method using machine learning methodology with concepts from game theory. Cats without FIP were further subdivided into three subgroups: cardiac disease, neoplasia and other diseases. Serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were measured in serum and effusion, using assays previously validated in cats. Results Serum and effusion samples were available for the measurement of APPs from 88 and 67 cats, respectively. Concentrations of the APPs in serum and effusion were significantly different in cats with and without FIP ( P <0.001 for all three APPs). The best APP to distinguish between cats with and without FIP was AGP in the effusion; a cut-off value of 1550 g/ml had a sensitivity and specificity of 93% each for diagnosing FIP. Conclusions and relevance AGP, particularly if measured in effusion, was found to be useful in differentiating between FIP and other diseases, while SAA and Hp were not. The concentration of all three APPs in some diseases (eg, septic processes, disseminated neoplasia) was as high as in cats with FIP; therefore, none of these can be recommended as a single diagnostic test for FIP.","output":"Usefulness of acute phase proteins in differentiating between feline infectious peritonitis and other diseases in cats with body cavity effusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of COVID-19. Several etiologies have been identified, including pigment deposition likely associated with myopathic damage. Nevertheless, the relationship between longitudinal creatine-kinase trends and renal outcomes is uncertain. AIM: To correlate longitudinal changes in serum creatine-kinase levels with hospital-acquired AKI (beyond 48 h of hospital admission) in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, and creatine-kinase levels were assessed over time in 1551 hospitalized patients with normal renal function at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: In subjects who developed hospital-acquired AKI (n = 126, 8.1%), the serum creatine-kinase concentration before AKI onset was not different when compared to patients without AKI (slope of log creatine-kinase/day = ?0.09 [95% CI ?0.17 to +0.19] vs. +0.03 [95% CI ?0.1 to +0.1]). After AKI diagnosis, serum creatine-kinase levels showed a significantly ascendent slope (slope of log creatine-kinase/day after AKI diagnosis = +0.14; 95% CI + 0.05 to +0.3). The AKI evolution was the main factor associated with the creatine-kinase trend. Subjects with persistent AKI (n = 40, 32%) had rising creatine-kinase levels during hospitalization (slope of log creatine-kinase/day = +0.30 95% CI + 0.19 to +0.51). A rising creatine-kinase trend (n = 114, 8%) was associated with a 1.89-fold higher risk of in-hospital death (95% CI 1.14 to 3.16). Nevertheless, this association disappeared after adjusting AKI evolution and LDH baseline levels. CONCLUSION: In severe COVID-19 patients, a slight increase in creatine-kinase levels was observed after AKI occurrence but not before. Our results show that, at least for the appearance of hospital-acquired AKI, the CK rise does not meet the temporality criterion of causality regarding the occurrence of AKI. Rising creatine-kinase trends were associated with a higher risk of mortality, but this association was modified by AKI evolution and inflammation. There is a limited efficiency for AKI prognosis in the serial follow-up of CK levels in severe COVID-19 patients with normal renal function.","output":"Longitudinal Changes of Serum Creatine Kinase and Acute Kidney Injury among Patients with Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To report on safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous cladribine (Litak?) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: Litak? was offered to MS-patients irrespective of disease course. Litak? 10 mg was administered for 3-4 days during week 1. Based on lymphocyte count at week 4, patients received another 0-3 doses at week 5. A second course was administered 11 months later. Follow-up included adverse events, relapses, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 9-hole-peg and Timed-25-foot-walking tests, no-evidence-of-disease-activity (NEDA), no-evidence-of-progression-or-active-disease (NEPAD), MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL), and lymphocyte counts. Results: In all, 208 patients received at least one course of treatment. Age at baseline was 44 (17-72) years and EDSS 0-8.5. Cladribine was generally well tolerated. One myocardial infarction, one breast cancer, and three severe skin reactions occurred without long-term sequelae. Two patients died (one pneumonia, one encephalitis). Lymphopenia grade 3 occurred in 5% and grade 4 in 0.5%. In 94 out of 116 pwMS with baseline and follow-up (BaFU) data after two treatment courses, EDSS remained stable or improved. At 18 months, 64% of patients with relapsing MS and BaFU data (n = 39) had NEDA. At 19 months, 62% of patients with progressive MS and BaFU data (n = 13) had NEPAD. Of n = 13 patients whose CSF-NfL at baseline was elevated, 77% were normalised within 12 months. Conclusions: Litak? was well tolerated. Effectiveness in relapsing MS appeared similar to cladribine tablets and was encouraging in progressive MS. Our data suggest cladribine may be safe and effective in MS-patients irrespective of their disease stage.","output":"Subcutaneous cladribine to treat multiple sclerosis: experience in 208 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is a major public health challenge during the Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims towards the prevention of RTIs in 2018 and determine correlations among three domains. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards RTI prevention was assessed by using a validated self-administered questionnaire among pilgrims attending a weekly orientation course organized by private Hajj/Umrah companies. Out of 225 participants, 65.9% of respondents were female with the mean (SD) age of 46.74 (13.38) years. The interquartile range (IQR) score for knowledge is 18.0 (6.0), the mean scores of attitude and practice are 32.65 (4.72) and 25.30 (4.9). respectively. Significant and negative linear correlations between knowledge and practice (r = ?0.232, p < 0.001), and attitude and practice (r = 0.134, p = 0.045) were observed. Results from the current study showed good knowledge of RTIs among Malaysian pilgrims. However, a poor attitude was reflected in their preventive practice behaviors.

We point out some XR technologies used to deliver care for mental disorders, and to evaluate the effectiveness of using XR systems for anxiety and depression amidst other mental disorders. A search period of May 2017 and August 2021 was defined to filter out articles related to the usage of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (AR) in a mental health context. Search done on three databases namely Google Scholar, PubMED, and Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library yielded 689 articles. Also, 10 articles were recommended. Upon eligibility filtering, only 72 articles were found relevant and were utilized for the study. Results show that the 72 studies were done in only 23 countries across the globe, with the majority of studies being reported for developed countries such as USA (20.64%) and Germany (11.11%). Thus this could rapidly aid intervention of mental health disorder with XR. Meanwhile, none of the studies observed was from an African country. The majority of the articles reported that XR techniques led to significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression. The majority of studies (23, 36.51%) were published in the year 2021 of the total studies included. In a sense, this data might be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we report that the landscape of m(6)A deposition is drastically shifted during Kaposis sarcomaCassociated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic infection for both viral and host transcripts. In line with previous reports, we also saw an overall decrease in host methylation in favor of viral messenger RNA (mRNA), along with 5 hypomethylation and 3 hypermethylation. During KSHV lytic infection, a major shift in overall mRNA abundance is driven by the viral endoribonuclease SOX, which induces the decay of greater than 70% of transcripts. Here, we reveal that interlukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA, a well-characterized, SOX-resistant transcript, is m(6)A modified during lytic infection. Furthermore, we show that this modification falls within the IL-6 SOX resistance element, an RNA element in the IL-6 3 untranslated region (UTR) that was previously shown to be sufficient for protection from SOX cleavage. We show that the presence of this m(6)A modification is essential to confer SOX resistance to the IL-6 mRNA. We next show that this modification recruits the m(6)A reader YTHDC2 and found that YTHDC2 is necessary for the escape of the IL-6 transcript.

Development of multifunctional agents that can inhibit A aggregation, rapidly disaggregate fibrils, and image aggregates is one of the effective strategies to treat and diagnose AD. Herein, the multifunctionality of nitrogen-doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) targeting A aggregation is reported. CPDs inhibit the fibrillization of A monomers and rapidly disintegrate A fibrils by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with A in a time scale of seconds to minutes. Moreover, the interactions make CPDs label A fibrils and emit enhanced red fluorescence by the binding, so CPDs can be used for in vivo imaging of the amyloids in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 as an AD model. Importantly, CPDs are demonstrated to scavenge the in vivo amyloid plaques and to promote the lifespan extension of CL2006 strain by alleviating the A-triggered toxicity. Taken together, the multifunctional CPDs show an exciting prospect for further investigations in A-targeted AD treatment and diagnosis, and this study provides new insight into the development of carbon materials in AD theranostics.","output":"Nitrogen-Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots: A Potent Scavenger and Detector Targeting Alzheimer's -Amyloid Plaques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable changes in the delivery of primary care in the UK, including rapid digitalisation, yet the extent to which these have impacted on marginalised migrant groups - already facing existing barriers to NHS care - is unknown. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of health professionals and migrants will support initiatives to deliver more effective health services, including delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, to marginalised groups. Aim To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out. Design and Setting Primary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings. Methods In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. Results 64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacists); Phase 2 comprised administrative staff (11 PMs and 5 receptionists); and in Phase 3 we recruited 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). We found that digitalisation and virtual consultations (telephone, video, and online form-based) have amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. Use of virtual consultations has resulted in concerns around building trust and the risk of missing safeguarding cues. Participants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing healthcare due to the physical closure of surgeries. Participants reported indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. In addition, migrants reported a range of specific beliefs around COVID-19 and on potential COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. PCPs raised concerns that migrants may have increased risk factors for poor general health and to severe illness from COVID-19, in part due to their social and economic situation. Innovative opportunities were suggested to engage migrant groups through translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube which merit further exploration. Conclusion Pandemic-related changes in primary care delivery may be here to stay, and some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. As primary care networks operationalise the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, these findings provide critical information on specific strategies required to support migrant population to access primary care and overcome misinformation around COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Migrants' Access to Primary Care:A National Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In This paper presents an application for drone named VIRODRONE- A drone designed for Fighting Viral Diseases.

It is known that the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the manufacture of drugs and vaccines are still under investigation, but in infected patients, innate immune responses in the form of alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, airway epithelial cells, congenital lymphocytes, and neutrophils work together in the fight against infection. Next comes the adaptive immune response in the form of antibodies (immunoglobulins) which help in fighting infections due to SARS-CoV-2. These immune responses include increasing levels of cytokines, coagulation parameters, C-reactive protein, neutrophils, and decreasing total lymphocytes. It is also known that COVID-19 patients with severe disease often experience higher total antibody, IgM responses, and IgG responses than COVID-19 patients without congenital disease.

Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge. Our results underscore the potential use of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL as an adjuvant to achieve protection after single immunization with recombinant protein and inactivated vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.","output":"Sterilizing Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mice by a Single-Shot and Modified Imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 Agonist-Adjuvanted Recombinant Spike Protein Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most severe global health issue Abnormal liver functions are frequently reported in these patients However, liver function abnormality was often overlooked during COVID-19 treatment, and data regarding liver functions after cure of COVID-19 is limited This study aimed to reveal the changes of liver function tests (LFTs) during hospitalization, and its clinical significance in patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this retrospective, bi-center study, a total of 158 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China were included from January 22nd, 2020 to February 20th, 2020 Clinical features, laboratory parameters including LFTs, and treatment data were collected and analyzed LFTs included alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and total bilirubin Patients were considered with abnormal LFTs when any value of these tests was higher than upper limit of normal Results: Of 158 patients with COVID-19, 67 (42 41%) patients had abnormal LFTs on admission and another 50 (31 65%) patients developed abnormal LFTs during hospitalization The incidence of LFTs abnormality in severe COVID-19 cases was significantly higher than non-severe cases All LFTs in COVID-19 patients were correlated with oxygenation index There was no statistical difference in treatment between the patients with or without liver test abnormalities By the time of discharge, there were still 64 (40 50%) patients with abnormal LFTs Logistic regression analysis identified younger age, hypertension and low lymphocyte counts as independent risk factors for persistent abnormal LFTs during hospitalization Conclusion: Liver function tests abnormality was common in COVID-19 patients and was more prevalent in severe cases than in non-severe cases A substantial percentage of patients still had abnormal LFTs by the time of discharge","output":"A High Percentage of Patients Recovered From COVID-19 but Discharged With Abnormal Liver Function Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine protists are integral to the structure and function of pelagic ecosystems and marine carbon cycling, with rhizarian biomass alone accounting for more than half of all mesozooplankton in the oligotrophic oceans.

Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Some cases even remain asymptomatic. Data regarding the epidemiological and clinical features of children with COVID-19 are limited. Symptoms in children are thought to be atypical when compared with adults. As a result, diagnosis in many children is likely to be missed. Children presenting with atypical symptoms, especially those with a history of exposure, should be referred to early screening. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-month-old boy presented with a 2-day history of diarrhea. Chest computed tomography scan showed pneumonia. After admission to the hospital, the patient exhibited no diarrhea or other symptoms. Positive presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, was confirmed by 5 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was also found to have liver damage. DIAGNOSIS: Swabs were obtained for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by established methods. INTERVENTIONS: Chinese traditional medicine prescription OUTCOMES: Following treatment, signs of pneumonia on computed tomography scans were observed to be partially absorbed, and 2 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing of swab samples were negative. The patient was discharged on the 21st day after admission to the hospital. On the 21st day after discharge, the patient had no recurrence of disease, no recurrence of pulmonary lesions, and normal liver function. CONCLUSION: This case study suggests that diarrhea not explained by common causes, such as acute gastroenteritis, could be a preliminary symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Despite the lack of the presence of a fever or cough, lung pulmonary lesions were present in this child. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cause hepatic injury. Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovery period, IgM and IgG antibodies can be positive for a long time.","output":"A child infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presenting with diarrhea without fever and cough: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are on the front lines of changing policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant change was also observed in delaying the timing for monitoring therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors, assessing treatment response with imaging tests, and flushing central venous devices. Clinical research and scientific activities were reduced in 80.3% and 80.1% of respondents previously implicated in these activities, respectively. CONCLUSION Medical oncologists face many challenges in providing cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Although most of the changes in their attitudes and practice were reasonable responses to the current health care emergency without expected major negative impact on patient outcomes, some potentially alarming signals of undertreatment were observed.","output":"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Attitudes and Practice of Italian Oncologists Toward Breast Cancer Care and Related Research Activities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When an injured patient presents to a non-trauma hospital, and a provider determines that the needs of the patient exceed the capabilities of the hospital, she faces a critical decision: where to send the patient?

Most organizations and individuals with animals under their care had emergency preparedness plans in place for various scenarios; however, the restrictions on human movement to contain the spread of COVID-19, coupled with the economic impact and the health effects of COVID-19 on the skilled workforce, constituted a new threat to animal welfare for which there was no blueprint. The spontaneous formation of a national, multisectoral response group on animal welfare, consisting of more than 34 organizations with animals under their care, facilitated information flow during the crisis, which helped to mitigate some of the shocks to different organizations and to ensure continuity of care for animals during the pandemic. We conclude that animal welfare is a shared responsibility, and accordingly, a multisectoral approach to animal welfare during a crisis is required. Our experience demonstrates that to safeguard animal welfare during crises, nations should consider the following: a national risk assessment, clear communication channels, contingency plans for animal welfare, a crisis response group, and support systems for animal care providers. Our findings and recommendations from the Australian context may inform other countries to ensure that animal welfare is not compromised during the course of unpredictable events.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Welfare of Animals in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The circulation of heavy metals in nature is characterized by high toxicity. However, the effects depend on the amount of toxic, the form of exposure to toxicity, the types of species exposed, age, sex, genetics and nutritional status, and on the consequences in ecosystems. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental situation in some regions has deteriorated even more due to poor monitoring by state institutions. The challenges that await us in the future are complex and hence we risk not knowing how to meet the future challenges. The situation with toxicity and pollution is complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which for the first time in this century has turned into a global pandemic. Although we were not prepared to cope with this pandemic, still we succeeded to manage it better than the previous pandemics. High concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and nickel are among the metals that are dangerous for the public health of citizens. Metallic elements are characterized by toxic effects, especially with the consumption of food products. High concentrations cause great damage to human and animal organs but sometimes even small concentrations of it can have harmful effects. The increase in toxic concentration has affected industrial development, poor waste management, the release of toxic gases from industrial activities, as well as use of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture. High toxicity causes health damage, e.g. resulting from human exposure to metal toxicity and the use of contaminated foods. The heavy metals present in the environment such as Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn, Co, Cr, are essential nutrients required for various biochemical and physiological functions. ? 2022.

ANIMALS 56 crossbred steers. PROCEDURES Paired fecal samples and nasal swab specimens were obtained and were tested for BCV, using antigen-capture ELISA. Paired serum samples obtained were tested for antibodies to BCV, using antibody-detection ELISA. Information was collected on weight gain, clinical signs, and treatments for enteric and respiratory tract disease during the study period. RESULTS Number of samples positive for bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) or bovine enteric coro navirus (BECV) was 37/224 (17%) and 48/223 (22%), respectively. Some cattle (25/46, 45%) shed BECV and BRCV. There were 25/29 (86%) cattle positive for BECV that shed BRCV, but only 1/27 (4%) cattle negative to BECV shed BRCV. Twenty-seven of 48 (56%) paired nasal swab specimens and fecal samples positive for BECV were positive for BRCV. In contrast, only 10/175 (6%) paired nasal swab specimens and fecal samples negative for BECV were positive for BRCV. Only shedding of BECV was associated with significantly reduced weight gain. Seroconversion to BCV during the 21 days after arrival was detected in 95% of the cattle tested. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Feedlot cattle infected with BCV after transport shed BCV from the respiratory tract and in the feces.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the nursing home reported quality. DESIGN: We combined the COVID-19 data reported by the California Department of Public Health, quality ratings provided by Nursing Home Compare, and patient racial information from Long-Term Care Focus to examine the association between nursing home reported quality and COVID-19 cases and deaths. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data from 1223 California skilled nursing facilities with reported quality and longitudinal data of COVID-19 cases were used. METHODS: The dependent variable is COVID-19 residents' cases and deaths. The main independent variable is nursing home reported quality. Nursing home ownership, size, years of operation, and patient race composition are also included. RESULTS: Nursing home star ratings and greater percentage of residents from different racial and ethnicity groups were significantly (P < .01) related to increased probability of having a COVID-19 residents' case or death.

This procedure has not been reported using the laparoscopic or robotic approach. Although this technique, in low-volume centres, could lead to an increased risk of morbidity, in high-volume centres morbidity and mortality are similar to those of the standard D2 lymphadenectomy. Robotic surgery could overcome the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, especially in the removal of posterior nodal stations. In this report we describe the feasibility of fully robotic interaortocaval lymphadenectomy, following similar steps to those of the traditional open approach. METHODS The procedure was a total gastrectomy with oesophago-jejunal Roux-en-Y reconstruction in a 73 year-old male patient with clinically advanced (cT3) gastric adenocarcinoma, located in the lesser curvature (middle-upper third). The da Vinci? Si HD with a double-docking robot set-up was employed. RESULTS The histological specimen examination showed a pT4aN3bM0, Borrmann type III, intestinal histotype, G3 gastric adenocarcinoma. No involvement of resection margins was found (R0 resection). The numbers of total harvested and positive nodes were 57 and 41, respectively; the number of harvested interaortocaval nodes was 14, and all of them were negative for tumour involvement. Operative time for lymphadenectomy was comparable with that of the traditional open approach. The postoperative period was uneventful and hospital stay was 11 days. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted interaortocaval lymphadenectomy is a feasible technique in high-volume centres for gastric cancer surgery, and should be considered in curative surgery for selected advanced cases, especially for the high-risk group of lymph node metastases in the posterior area.","output":"Assessing the feasibility of full robotic interaortocaval nodal dissection for locally advanced gastric cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A major source of noise pollution is traffic. In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown caused a substantial decrease in mobility, possibly affecting noise levels. The aim is to analyze the effects of the lockdown measures on noise levels in the densely populated Ruhr Area. We focus on the analysis of noise levels before and during lockdown considering different land use types, weekdays, and time of day. METHODS: We used data from 22 automatic sound devices of the SALVE (Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments) project, running since 2019 in Bochum, Germany. We performed a pre/during lockdown comparison of A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels. The study period includes five weeks before and five weeks during the SARS-CoV-2 induced administrative lockdown measures starting on 16 March 2020. We stratified our data by land use category (LUC), days of the week, and daytime. RESULTS: We observed highest noise levels pre-lockdown in the 'main street' and 'commercial areas' (68.4 +/- 6.7 dB resp. 61.0 +/- 8.0 dB), while in 'urban forests' they were lowest (50.9 +/- 6.6 dB). A distinct mean overall noise reduction of 5.1 dB took place, with noise reductions occurring in each LUC. However, the magnitude of noise levels differed considerably between the categories. Weakest noise reductions were found in the 'main street' (3.9 dB), and strongest in the 'urban forest', 'green space', and 'residential area' (5.9 dB each). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with studies from European cities. Strikingly, all studies report noise reductions of about 5 dB. Aiming at a transformation to a health-promoting urban mobility can be a promising approach to mitigating health risks of noise in cities. Overall, the experiences currently generated by the pandemic offer data for best practices and policies for the development of healthy urban transportation-the effects of a lower traffic and more tranquil world were experienced firsthand by people during this time.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown Measures on Noise Levels in Urban Areas-A Pre/during Comparison of Long-Term Sound Pressure Measurements in the Ruhr Area, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Geometric attacks are still challenging issues in image watermarking.

METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.5) was used to project the lifetime costs and health outcomes of flash glucose monitoring and SMBG/POCT from a Chinese societal perspective. We considered both hospital and individual version flash glucose monitoring to reflect the clinical practice in China. The clinical inputs leveraged the outcomes from both clinical trials and real-world studies. Cohort characteristics, intervention costs, treatment-related disutility and mortality were extracted from the literature. We also conducted scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results. RESULTS: Compared with SMBG/POCT using efficacy results from clinical trial, flash glucose monitoring brought the incremental costs of Chinese yuan (CNY) 58,021 and CNY 90,997 and additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 1.22 and 0.65 for patients with T1D and patients with T2D, respectively. According to the WHO-CHOICE threshold of three times the gross domestic product per capita in China (CNY 217,341 in 2020) as cost-effectiveness threshold, flash glucose monitoring was cost-effective for both patients with T1D and patients with T2D with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of CNY 47,636 and CNY 140,297 per QALY gained, respectively. According to the real-world effectiveness data, flash glucose monitoring was dominant for patients with T1D (lower costs and better effectiveness) and cost-effective for patients with T2D with an ICER of CNY 124,169 per QALY gained compared with SMBG/POCT. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Flash glucose monitoring is likely to be considered as a cost-effective strategy compared to SMBG/POCT for Chinese patients with T1D and patients with T2D receiving insulin therapy.

Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way. We proposed the Bayesian hierarchical random-effects (random intercepts and random slopes) model under the context of generalised linear model to capture heterogeneity and variation on the individual, generation, and household levels. It was applied to empirical surveillance data on the influenza epidemic in Taiwan. The parameters of interest were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical models. Comparisons between models were made using the deviance information criterion. Based on the result of the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical method under the context of the ReedCFrost transmission model, the regression coefficient regarding the protective effect of vaccination varied statistically significantly from household to household. The result of such a heterogeneity was robust to the use of different prior distributions (including non-informative, sceptical, and enthusiastic ones).

Activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway has increasingly been implicated in the prothrombotic state observed in both sterile and infectious inflammatory conditions. We thus sought to assess activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway in subjects with COVID-19 infection. Baseline plasma levels of protease:serpin complexes indicative of activation of the contact and intrinsic pathwayswere measured in samples from inpatients with COVID-19 andhealthy individuals. Cleaved kininogen, a surrogate for bradykinin release, was measured by ELISA, while extrinsic pathway activation was assessed by microvesicle tissue factor-mediated factor Xa generation (MVTF). Samples were collected within 24 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty patients with COVID-19 and thirty age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Contact system and intrinsic pathway activation in COVID-19 were demonstrated by increased plasma levels offactor XIIa:C1 esterase inhibitor (FXIIa:C1), kallikrein:C1, FXIa:C1, FXIa:1antitrypsin, and FIXa:antithrombin (FIXa:AT). MVTF levels were also increased in COVID-19 subjects. Since FIXa:AT levels were associated with both contact/intrinsic pathway complexes and MVTF, activation of FIX likely occurs through both the contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Among the protease:serpin complexes measured, FIXa:AT complexes were uniquely associated with clinical indices of disease severity, specificallythe total length of hospitalization, length of ICU stay, and extent of lung CT changes.We conclude that the contact/intrinsic pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of the prothrombotic state in COVID-19.

This pedagogical study explored Aston Universitys Bioscience students experiences of studying from home, and the impact of the lockdown on mental wellbeing and quality of life. 151 students completed an online survey during August 2020, which included open and closed questions. Analysis of survey data revealed that a majority of students reported positive experiences of online open-book assessments and most would welcome this format in the future. The majority of students faced no technical issues, predominantly stating that they also had good internet connectivity. Shifting to remote learning and online classrooms uncovered conflicting preferences;despite wanting more interactive lectures, only half of the students were comfortable interacting using video cameras. Free text responses provided an insight into how some students reported an inadequate home working space/environment and lacked necessary items such as a desk, highlighting how remote working may intensify social and digital inequality - particularly for students from more deprived households.

This hype has raised awareness of the security issues associated with remote working, which obviously is a very positive acknowledgement that current security frameworks need to be improved to embrace the fast-growing use of technologies such as video conferencing, screen sharing and even Cloud identity management systems.

Odds of vaccine hesitancy were higher among patients aged 18-44 years versus those 45-64 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.5;95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0 to 2.3), Black patients versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 1.9;95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), Native Americans or Pacific Islanders versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 2.0;95% CI, 1.1 to 3.7), and women versus men (OR, 1.6;95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0). About half (53%) of patients who were vaccine hesitant expressed concerns about side effects. Responders' main information sources about COVID-19 vaccines were television news and dialysis staff (68% and 38%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis in the United States are hesitant about seeking COVID-19 vaccination. Facilitating uptake requires outreach to younger patients, women, and Black, Native American, or Pacific Islander patients, and addressing concerns about side effects.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Acceptability in Patients on Hemodialysis: A Nationwide Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carboxylesterases (CESs) play a key role in the metabolism of many small molecule therapeutics including Remdesivir, the first drug authorized by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The overall activity of CESs, however, can be drastically different person to person. This interindividual variability has been shown to influence the metabolism and, in some cases, clinical outcomes of patients treated with drugs that are substrates for carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). The factors that contribute to this interindividual variability have not been fully uncovered, despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism. We believe that this lack of knowledge is due to the scarcity and limitations of currently available approaches to study CES1 activity in live samples. To address these challenges, we have developed new fluorescent chemical tools that can specifically report on CES1 activity in live cells. Subsequently, we deployed our CES1 fluorescent chemical tools in a new chemical biology approach to monitor CES1 sequence-dependent activity variations in live cells. Overall, the tools and approaches we develop can help uncover factors that result in interindividual variability of CES1 activity.","output":"Revealing human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) sequence-dependent activity variations using fluorescent chemical tools."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to conduct analysis on the WHO dataset to produce predictive analysis applying different machine learning regression approaches such as decision trees, LSTM, and CNN regressor The primary data has 91 entries, which consists of data of various countries with respect to dates along with confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and recovered cases The dataset has been divided into 70:30 in which 70 percent is used for training and validation, and 30 percent is used for testing The coronavirus disease outbreak started in 2019, arising in Wuhan, China The key objective is to exercise different artificial intelligence approaches, we ought to predict the confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and recovered cases, and further, various visualization techniques have been used to deduce the meaningful inferences from the model's prediction and perform specific analytics on the results concluded The prediction models such as LSTM and CNN are evaluated on the basis of several loss functions such as R2 score and Mean Squared Error ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A Comparative Study of Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for COVID-19 Trends and Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A high percentage of patients with cancer experience cognitive impairment after cancer treatment, resulting in a decreased health-related quality of life and difficulty returning to work. Consequently, there is a need for effective treatment options to improve cognitive functioning in these patients. In a healthy aging population, multidomain web-based lifestyle interventions have been found to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the web-based lifestyle intervention Mijn Fitte Brein (My Fit Brain [MFB]) on cognitive functioning in patients with cancer returning to work. METHODS: The study consists of a feasibility study (N=10), followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=220). Patients will be recruited by their occupational physicians after their return to work following cancer treatment. Mijn Fitte Brein is organized into 4-week cycles in which patients set a lifestyle goal using the Goal Attainment Scale, receive weekly tips and support, and finally evaluate whether they succeeded in achieving this goal. Lifestyle goals are based on 6 domains: physical exercise, diet, sleep, stress, alcohol use, and smoking. In the feasibility study, data on user experience (structured interview) and usability, assessed with the Post-Study System Usability Scale, will be collected and used to optimize Mijn Fitte Brein. In the RCT, patients will be randomized 1:1 between an intervention group and a control group. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is subjective cognitive functioning, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog). Secondary outcome measures are lifestyle, objective cognitive functioning, and work and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Recruitment for the feasibility study has started in February 2020. As of July 2020, however, no patients have been enrolled (due to COVID-19 restrictions). The findings of the feasibility study will be used to optimize the Mijn Fitte Brein intervention. Enrollment for the RCT will continue when possible. The feasibility study will take 6 months (including making adjustments to the intervention), and the RCT will take 2 years. The final results are expected in 2024. The results of the feasibility study and the RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a multidomain web-based lifestyle intervention will be studied in patients with cancer. If Mijn Fitte Brein is found to be effective in decreasing cognitive complaints in these patients returning to work, it will be a promising treatment option because of being both affordable and accessible.

Data are from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and consider the years of 2002, 2007, and 2012. The results show evident ceiling effects with a threshold of 1588 m3/(capita/year) in the multiple predictor model. Above this value, the total renewable water resources per capita no longer have a considerable effect on cereal import dependency. Importantly, we found that if integrated water resource management improves, cereal import dependency will increase for countries with total renewable water resources per capita between 1588 m3/(capita/year) and 5000 m3/(capita/year), but not for countries below or equal to the threshold of 1588 m3/(capita/year). Water-scarce countries above the threshold use cereal imports as a coping strategy to save limited national water resources. This strategy might be suggested to extremely water-scarce countries below the threshold to increase their water use efficiency. Global solidarity of grain exporters with water-scarce countries is required to guarantee their food security, while water-scarce countries need to overcome their skepticism of foreign dominance through food imports.","output":"Scarce Water Resources and Cereal Import Dependency: The Role of Integrated Water Resources Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although vaccines against influenza A virus are the most effective method to combat infection, it is clear that their production needs to be accelerated and their efficacy improved.

To examine these concerns, the aim of the present study was to assess longitudinal changes in addictive and problematic behaviors (i.e., problematic social media use, Internet gaming disorder, gambling disorder, problematic pornography use, and compulsive sexual behavior disorder) over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three waves of data collection took place in different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hungary in a general population, from the first wave of lockdowns to the second and third waves of restrictions (May, 2020; N(T1) = 1747; JuneCAugust, 2020; N(T2) = 656; January, 2021; N(T3) = 411). Latent growth curve models were calculated to assess the potential changes in addictive and problematic behaviors over time. RESULTS: Latent growth curve models showed that the sample varied in their initial scores, but there were no significant changes over time in any of the examined behaviors, except for compulsive sexual behavior disorder, which demonstrated a small but significant increase (i.e., positive and significant slope factor). However, the rate of this change was negligible. Overall, there were no noteworthy changes over time regarding any of the examined addictive and problematic behaviors. CONCLUSION: Contrary to initial concerns, no substantial changes over time were observed regarding the examined addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. These findings indicate that those who had no previous problem with these addictive behaviors, might have not developed a problem, and those who had problem with either of the behaviors previously, might have not experienced a significant increase in their symptoms.","output":"No Significant Changes in Addictive and Problematic Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Lockdowns: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Catastrophes are known to have an impact on relationships as well as on mental health. This study evaluated differences in several mental health and well-being measures according to relationship quality during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures.

Relationship quality was measured with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI), and mental health measures included quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). ANOVAs with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests and Chisquared tests were applied. In all mental health scales, individuals with good relationship quality (n = 543) scored better than individuals with poor relationship quality (n = 190) or without relationship (n = 272). The odds ratios (OR) between the poor and good relationship quality groups were 3.5 for the PHQ-9, 3.4 for the GAD-7, and 2.0 for the ISI. Additionally, individuals without no relationship scored better on all scales than individuals with poor relationship quality (all p-values < .05). Relationship quality was related to mental health during COVID-19. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased according to relationship quality from 13% up to 35%.

We scoped the existing literature on the abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Google scholar and World Health Organization COVID-19 database. RESULTS: 35 studies were included in the final descriptive synthesis. Among the studies reporting positive abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, majority described imaging abnormalities of the GI tract (16 studies), of which bowel wall thickening was most frequently reported. Other findings noted were abdominal imaging manifestations of bowel ischemia with thrombosis of the splanchnic vasculature, and imaging features suggestive of pancreatitis. Imaging findings suggestive of solid organ infarction were reported in nine studies. An association between imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis and COVID-19 was noted in three studies. Incidental lung base findings on abdominal imaging were noted in 18 studies, where patients presented with predominant GI symptoms. The most common finding was bilateral ground glass opacities (90.7%) with predominant multilobar (91.1%) and peripheral (64.4%) distribution. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides insight into the abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these imaging manifestations will not only help in further research but also will aid in curtailing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.

Evaluating the possible impact on the invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence associated with a decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination is important to advocate the PCV programs. Using a deterministic, dynamic transmission model, the differential incidence and burden of IPD in children younger than 5 years in Japan were estimated between the rapid vaccination recovery (January 2021) and the delayed vaccination recovery (April 2022) scenarios for the next 10 years. In our model, the IPD incidence was reduced from 11.9/100,000 in 2019 to 6.3/100,000 in 2020, caused by a reduced transmission rate due to the COVID-19 mitigation measures. Assuming a recovery in the transmission rate in 2022 April, the incidence of IPD was estimated to increase with maximal incidence of 12.1 and 13.1/100,000 children under 5 years in the rapid and the delayed vaccination recovery scenarios. The difference in the total IPD incidence between these two scenarios was primarily driven by vaccine serotypes IPD incidence. The difference of incidence was not observed between the two scenarios after 2025. The persistent decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination rates due to the impact of COVID-19 might lead to an increased IPD incidence and an incremental disease burden.","output":"The incremental burden of invasive pneumococcal disease associated with a decline in childhood vaccination using a dynamic transmission model in Japan: A secondary impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background When a disaster occurs, a health response must adapt to meet the needs of the community.

Further, the disaster-related content that is important to be included in undergraduate nursing curricula is poorly understood. Methods This study used a modified three-round Delphi design guided by the principles of the Guidance on Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies . Data was collected from Australian clinical and academic nurses via online surveys. Analysis was undertaken using descriptive statistics including means of central tendency, with disaster content topic areas and statements considered a priority if they obtained a mean score of four out of five, or greater. Results A total of 38 nurses participated in this study. Across the three rounds, eight topic areas and 37 different statements were included. High priority statements for topic inclusions in undergraduate curricula were disaster knowledge, assessment and triage, critical thinking, and technical skills. Additionally, statements relating to mental wellbeing and teamwork in stressful situations were ranked as the highest. Conclusions Disaster-related content should be included in undergraduate nursing curricula. This content could be embedded within existing units of study and/or delivered as a standalone unit of study.

The clear causes of these TTS features are uncertain, given the limited understanding of this intriguing syndrome until now.

However, a systematic and comprehensive characterization of the genetic or epigenetic factors significantly associated with TTS is lacking. Thus, we here conducted a systematic review of the literature before June 2021, to contribute to the identification of potential genetic and epigenetic factors associated with TTS.

In this article, I draw on the work of William James and W. E. B. Du Bois to articulate a conception of ecclesial belonging as a social epistemological process engaging a complex, fluid multiplicity of knowers of various scales. I argue that, in this view, ecclesial rationality involves the construction of a concatenation of internal and external practices individual believers and groups can traverse so long as they consistently satisfy a plurality of desiderata. I suggest that what is irrational about religious-based defiance of COVID-19 guidelines is the church-sanctioned severance of internal from external practices. I suggest that this behavior is supported by a failure to grasp the demands of ecclesial rationality rather than embrace them, and that this conception of rationality may have been eroded by the value-neutral skepticism of secular rationality. ? 2021 Walter Scott Stepanenko, published by De Gruyter 2021.","output":"Ecclesial Belonging in a World of Pure Experience: William James, W.

This is mainly because childhood and adolescence represent key stages for addressing health, social, cognitive, emotional and educational development and influencing health behavior and healthy lifestyles over the life-course. The education sector is particularly important, and schools represent a critical setting to facilitate health literacy teaching and learning, for example in health education classes or whole-of-school approaches. Regarding the question of what makes health literacy so important for children and adolescents these days, there are three key themes and recent developments which amplified the meaning and relevance of health literacy for public health and societies: (i) A globalizing world: Globalization and digitalization change the ways in which health is negotiated and promoted, including that today health information is almost limitlessly accessible in everyday life. (ii) The information overload: The overload of information - a.k.a. infodemic (short for information epidemic) - makes health literacy a critical skill-set in managing the overabundance of information that is available through digital communication channels; while at the same time children and adolescents are increasingly turning to the Internet and social media as sources of health information and for communication about health issues with their peers or social contacts. (iii) The COVID-19 pandemic: The pandemic has once again underlined how important health literacy is not only for understanding public health recommendations, applying health behaviours, avoiding unnecessary risks, and protecting individual, family, and population health, but also to learn about the importance of vaccination, to become knowledgeable and skilled in navigating the infodemic, and to identifying fake news and disinformation about COVID-19. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together five contemporary projects on health literacy from Germany in and with schools that reflect the above issues: (i) A cross-sectional pen-and-paper survey in primary schools on children's health literacy; (ii) A survey on adolescents health literacy; (iii) The development of a toolbox for health literacy interventions in schools; (iv) An intervention for improving adolescent's mental health literacy in schools, (v) A whole school approach and organizational health literacy in schools. Each project will be given ample time to present their findings, which will be followed by Q&A and an open discussion with the audiences. This workshop offers a forum for researchers, practitioners and policymakers interested in school related health literacy and school health promotion. By dialogue and two-way communication, vivid interaction will be ensured, allow building synergies, and facilitate networking and capacity building. KEY MESSAGES: Health literacy contributes to promoting and maintaining child and adolescent health in times of crisis like the COVID19 pandemic. Health literacy needs to be strengthened through investments in the education sector and school health promotion programs.","output":"2.L.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated between 23 March 2020 and 14 June 2020, deemed exposed to the pandemic/lockdown, to patients treated between 18 December 2019 and 10 March 2020, deemed to be unexposed. Data came from electronic clinical records from secondary care mental health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment area population 0.86 million). Eligible patients were aged 65 years or over at baseline with at least 14 days' follow\\\\up, excluding patients diagnosed with confirmed or suspected SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. The primary outcome was all\\\\cause mortality. FINDINGS: In the two cohorts, 3,073 subjects were exposed to lockdown and 4,372 subjects were unexposed; the cohorts were followed up for an average of 74 and 78 days, respectively.

All these viruses are seasonal and generate short-term immunity. Like the highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the endemic coronaviruses have zoonotic origins. Thus, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of these human viruses might provide insight into the future trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Because the zoonotic sources of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are known, we applied a population geneticsCphylogenetic approach to investigate which selective events accompanied the divergence of these viruses from the animal ones. Results indicated that positive selection drove the evolution of some accessory proteins, as well as of the membrane proteins. However, the spike proteins of both viruses and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of HCoV-OC43 represented the major selection targets. Specifically, for both viruses, most positively selected sites map to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) and are polymorphic. Molecular dating for the HCoV-229E spike protein indicated that RBD Classes I, II, III, and IV emerged 3C9 years apart. However, since the appearance of Class V (with much higher binding affinity), around 25 years ago, limited genetic diversity accumulated in the RBD. These different time intervals are not fully consistent with the hypothesis that HCoV-229E spike evolution was driven by antigenic drift. An alternative, not mutually exclusive possibility is that strains with higher affinity for the cellular receptor have out-competed strains with lower affinity. The evolution of the HCoV-OC43 spike protein was also suggested to undergo antigenic drift. However, we also found abundant signals of positive selection in HE. Whereas such signals might result from antigenic drift, as well, previous data showing co-evolution of the spike protein with HE suggest that optimization for human cell infection also drove the evolution of this virus. These data provide insight into the possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, especially in case the virus should become endemic.","output":"Adaptation of the endemic coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E to the human host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is highly contagious and serious, it has posed a major threat to public health worldwide.

Therapeutic drug inhibitors targeting angiogenesis are clinically effective. We have previously identified GT198 (gene symbol PSMC3IP, also known as Hop2) as an oncoprotein that induces tumor angiogenesis in human cancers, including oral cancer. In this study, we show that the GT198 protein is a direct drug target of more than a dozen oncology drugs and several clinically successful anticancer herbs. GT198 is a DNA repair protein that binds to DNA. Using an in vitro DNA-binding assay, we tested the approved oncology drug set VII from the National Cancer Institute containing 129 oncology drugs. Identified GT198 inhibitors include but are not limited to mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, etoposide, dactinomycin, and imatinib. Paclitaxel and etoposide have higher binding affinities, whereas doxorubicin has higher binding efficacy due to competitive inhibition. GT198 shares protein sequence homology with DNA topoisomerases, which are known drug targets, so that GT198 is likely a new drug target previously unrecognized. To seek more powerful GT198 inhibitors, we further tested several anticancer herbal extracts. The positive anticancer herbs with high affinity and high efficacy are all clinically successful ones, including allspice from Jamaica, Gleditsia sinensis or honey locust from China, and BIRM from Ecuador. Partial purification of allspice using an organic chemical approach demonstrated great feasibility of natural product purification, when the activity is monitored by the in vitro DNA-binding assay using GT198 as a target.

However, the exact mechanism through which ORF6 prevents STAT1 nuclear trafficking remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that ORF6 directly binds to STAT1 with or without IFN stimulation, resulting in the nuclear exclusion of STAT1. ORF6 also recognizes importin  subtypes with different modes, in particular, high affinity to importin 1 but a low affinity to importin 5. Although ORF6 potentially disrupts the importin /importin 1-mediated nuclear transport, thereby suppressing the nuclear translocation of the other classical nuclear localization signal-containing cargo proteins, the inhibitory effect of ORF6 is modest when compared with that of STAT1. The results indicate that the drastic nuclear exclusion of STAT1 is attributed to the specific binding with ORF6, which is a distinct strategy for the importin 1-mediated pathway. Combined with the results from a newly-produced replicon system and a hamster model, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 acts as a virulence factor via regulation of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to accelerate viral replication, resulting in disease progression.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to advance viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To determine the prevalence and breakdown of pain complaints among COVID-19 patients admitted for non-pain symptoms, and the association between the presence of pain and ICU admission and death Patients and Methods In this multi-center prospective study, data on the intensity and type of pain was collected on 169 patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection at 2 teaching hospitals in the U S and Korea and on 8 patients with acute pain at another large teaching hospital between February 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020 Results Sixty-five (38 5%) of 169 patients reported an active pain condition The most common pain complaints were headache (n=22, 30 1%), chest pain (n=17, 23 6%), spinal pain (n=18, 24 7%), myalgia (n=13, 18 1%), abdominal or pelvic pain (n=13, 17 8%), arthralgia (n=11, 15 3%), and generalized pain (n=9, 12 5%) Those reporting headache as their main complaint were less likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission (P = 003) Acetaminophen or NSAIDs were prescribed to 80 8%, opioids to 17 8%, adjuvants to 8 2% and ketamine to 5 5% of pain patients When age  65 years and sex were controlled for in multivariable analysis, the absence of pain was associated with ICU admission (OR 2 92;95% CI 1 42C6 28;P = 004) and death (OR 3 49;95% CI 1 40C9 76;P = 01) Conclusions Acute pain is common during active COVID-19, and may affect multiple organ systems Reasons why pain may be associated with reduced mortality include that an intense systemic stimulus (e g respiratory distress) might inhibit pain signals or that the catecholamine surge associated with severe respiratory distress might attenuate nociceptive signaling","output":"Pain Manifestations of COVID-19 and Their Association With Mortality: A Multi-Center Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a common etiological agent of acute respiratory tract infections.

Results The cadaveric study confirmed that a small paramedian muscle-splitting approach allows sufficient exposure to approach many foramen magnum lesions. Our case series included 10 patients with meningioma, one brainstem glioblastoma, one posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, and one odontoid pannus. The exposure was adequate in all cases. For the meningioma patients, six had gross total resections and four had subtotal resection because of tumor adherence to neurovascular structures. Two patients experienced postoperative cardiovascular complications. There were no new neurologic deficits, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or wound complications.

Treatments consisted of indomethacin, low-dose aspirin, omeprazole, and a flavonoid-based food supplement, plus azithromycin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and betamethasone as needed. The association of treatment timeliness and of clinical variables with the duration of symptoms and with the risk of hospitalization was evaluated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n=85) was treated at the earliest possible time (<72 h from onset of symptoms), and group 2 (n=73) was treated >72 h after the onset of symptoms. Clinical severity at the beginning of treatment was similar in the 2 groups.

Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was repurposed as a potential PEP agent against COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic open-label, parallel, cluster-randomised superiority trial in four sites in Switzerland and Brazil between March 2020 to March 2021. Clusters were randomised to receive LPV/r PEP (400/100 mg) twice daily for 5 days or no PEP (surveillance). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a close contact of >15 minutes in <2 metres distance or having shared a closed space for 2 hours with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome is the occurrence of COVID-19 defined by a SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or a seroconversion) and 1 compatible symptom within 21 days post-enrolment. ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04364022); Swiss National Clinical Trial Portal: SNCTP 000003732. FINDINGS: Of 318 participants, 157 (49.4%) were women; median age was 39 (interquartile range, 28-50) years. A total of 209 (179 clusters) participants were randomised to LPV/r PEP and 109 (95 clusters) to surveillance. Baseline characteristics were similar, with the exception of baseline SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, which was 3-fold more frequent in the LPV/r arm (34/209 [16.3%] vs 6/109 [5.5%], respectively). During 21-day follow-up, 48/318 (15.1%) participants developed COVID-19: 35/209 (16.7%) in the LPV/r group and 13/109 (11.9%) in the surveillance group (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.44; 95% CI, 0.76-2.73). In the primary endpoint analysis, which was adjuted for baseline imbalance, the hazard ratio for developing COVID-19 in the LPV/r group vs surveillance was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.29-1.26; p =0.18). INTERPRETATION: The role of LPV/r as PEP for COVID-19 remains unanswered. Although LPV/r over 5 days did not significantly reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in exposed individuals, we observed a change in the directionality of the effect in favour of LPV/r after adjusting for baseline imbalance. LPV/r for this indication merits further testing against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.

In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending.

Methods: We sent an 18-item survey to 1,213 patients who underwent elective hand and upper extremity surgery at 1 academic institution from October 2020 to January 2021. The survey consisted of questions related to patient demographics, treatment delays due to COVID-19, and patient perceptions of COVID-19 precautions. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the survey responses. Responses for patients aged 18-50 and 51+ were compared using a chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a Student t-test for continuous variables. Results: Out of 1,213 invitations, 384 survey respondents completed the survey (31.6%). Of the respondents, 16.8% reported delaying medical treatment for an average of 123.2 days because of COVID-19. The preventative measures were found to be adequate by 95% of patients. Only 2.6% of patients reported experiencing surgical delays due to preoperative COVID-19 testing or other COVID-19-related precautions. COVID-19 testing was seen as necessary by 88% of patients, and 74% did not find COVID-19 testing to be a barrier to their surgery. Patients aged 51+ were more likely to delay seeking medical treatment than younger patients (19.3% vs 9.1%, respectively). Furthermore, those that did delay seeking treatment waited longer on average than their younger counterparts (136.1 vs 72.9 days, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, patients undergoing hand and upper extremity surgery typically do not find COVID-19 precautions to be a significant barrier to care and understand their importance. Despite this, many patients, particularly older ones, are delaying medical care for extended periods of time. It is important for hand surgeons to acknowledge their patients' perspectives and work to educate patients on evolving surgical safety guidelines.

Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazaruss transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. METHODS: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens was distributed via Concordia Universitys mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. RESULTS: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were very stressed and 452 were slightly worried about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook ((2)(3)=11.76, P=.008), television ((2)(3)=12.40, P=.006), YouTube ((2)(3)=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix ((2)(3)=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health not good were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F(1,637)=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F(1,637)=14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said good than others; F(1,637)=13.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news.

METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","output":"Localization of Cell Receptor-Related Genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kidney through Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research nurses, midwives and allied health professionals are members of an important emergent profession delivering clinical research and, in the United Kingdom, have been the focus of considerable investment by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals in the UK about their experiences of working in research delivery. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically coded and analysed. RESULTS: Our analysis highlights how research nurses, midwives and allied health professionals adjust to new roles, shift their professional identities and undertake identity work using uniforms, name badges and job titles as they negotiate complex identities. CONCLUSIONS: Research nurses, midwives and allied health professionals experience considerable challenges as they enter and transition to a research delivery role, with implications for their sense of professional identities. A change in the work that they undertake and how they are (or perceive they are) viewed by others (including clinical non-research colleagues and patients) has implications for their sense of professional and individual identity. The tensions involved extend to their views on symbols of professional identity, such as uniforms, and as they seek to articulate and demonstrate the value of their conjoined role in research and as a healthcare professional, within the unfolding landscape of health research.

Fortunately, unlike adults, most children who contract COVID-19 have a mild respiratory illness or asymptomatic. It is now evident that a small percentage of children develop a critical and novel illness with persistent fever , prominent GI symptoms , single or multi-organ dysfunction including shock and laboratory evidence of profound inflammation which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the CDC. Some of the reported cases share features with well-known inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and toxic shock syndrome. The temporal relationship of MIS-C and COVID-19 suggests a post-infectious immune dysregulation.

The conventional therapeutic use of Nigella sativa, in different ways, has been reported in several studies to treat different diseases including influenza, headache, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, eczema, fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and fever. Based on previously reported potential therapeutic uses of N. sativa compounds, and keeping in mind the dire need of time for the development of potent antiviral, a combined docking, ADMET properties calculation, molecular dynamics, and MM-PBSA approaches were applied in the current study to check the therapeutic potentials of N. sativa chief constituents against COVID-19. Among the studied compounds, we found that dithymoquinone (DTQ), with binding affinity of ?8.6 kcal/mol compared to a positive control (chloroquine, ?7.2 kcal/mol) , has the high potential of binding at SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface and thus could be predicted as a plausible inhibitor to disrupt viral-host interactions. Molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns well complemented binding affinity of the compound and revealed strong stability of DTQ at the docked site. Additionally, MM-PBSA also affirms the docking results. Compound DTQ of the present study, if validated in wet lab experiments, could be used to treat COVID-19 and could serve as a lead in the future for development of more effective natural antivirals against COVID-19.

However, there have not been systematic analyses documenting such costs for beneficiaries and caregivers seeking vaccination. METHODS We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue (IDCC) in 2019 for the costs for beneficiaries and caregivers to 1) seek and know how to access vaccination (i.e., costs to immunization programs for social mobilization and interventions to increase vaccination demand), 2) take time off from work, chores, or school for vaccination (i.e., productivity costs), and 3) travel to vaccination sites. We assessed if these costs were specific to populations that faced other non-cost barriers, based on a framework for defining hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations for vaccination. RESULTS We found 57 studies describing information, education, and communication (IEC) costs, social mobilization costs, and the costs of interventions to increase vaccination demand, with mean costs per dose at $0.41 (standard deviation (SD) $0.83), $18.86 (SD $50.65) and $28.23 (SD $76.09) in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, respectively. Five studies described productivity losses incurred by beneficiaries and caregivers seeking vaccination ($38.33 per person; SD $14.72; n = 3). We identified six studies on travel costs incurred by beneficiaries and caregivers attending vaccination sites ($11.25 per person; SD $9.54; n = 4). Two studies reported social mobilization costs per dose specific to hard-to-reach populations, which were 2-3.5 times higher than costs for the general population. Eight studies described barriers to vaccination among hard-to-reach populations. CONCLUSION Social mobilization/IEC costs are well-characterized, but evidence is limited on costs incurred by beneficiaries and caregivers getting to vaccination sites. Understanding the potential incremental costs for populations facing barriers to reach vaccination sites is essential to improving vaccine program financing and planning.","output":"Promoting, seeking, and reaching vaccination services: A systematic review of costs to immunization programs, beneficiaries, and caregivers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the most critical aspect that all countries worldwide are trying to overcome.

METHODS: Recovered adult COVID-19 patients, who complained unexplained persisting symptoms for more than 30 days during the follow-up visits, were invited to participate in the study. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were imaged by [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT). Whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT, performed according to good clinical practice, was qualitatively (comparison with background/liver) and semi-quantitatively (target-to-blood pool ratio calculated as average SUVmax artery/average SUVmean inferior vena cava) analyzed. Negative follow-up [18F]FDG-PET/CT images of oncologic patients matched for age/sex served as controls. Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences between groups. SPSS version 26 was used for analyses. RESULTS: Ten recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients (seven male and three females, median age 52 years, range 46-80) with persisting symptoms were enrolled in the study. Common findings at visual analysis were increased [18F]FDG uptake in bone marrow and blood vessels (8/10 and 6/10 cases, respectively). [18F]FDG uptake in bone marrow did not differ between cases and controls (p = 0.16). The total vascular score was similar in the two groups (p = 0.95). The target-to-blood pool ratio resulted higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients than in controls. CONCLUSION: Although the total vascular score was similar in the two groups, the target-to-blood pool ratio was significantly higher in three vascular regions (thoracic aorta, right iliac artery, and femoral arteries) in the recovered COVID-19 cohort than in controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 induces vascular inflammation, which may be responsible for persisting symptoms.","output":"Vasculitis changes in COVID-19 survivors with persistent symptoms: an [18F]FDG-PET/CT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The da Vinci(?)

The primary objective of this review will be to determine the characteristics including format and content of multicomponent tools designed to standardise or improve ICU care. Secondary objectives are to describe the outcomes reported in these tools, the type of patients and settings studied, and to understand how these tools were developed and implemented in clinical practice. METHODS: We will search the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, OpenGrey, NHS evidence and Trial Registries from January 2000 onwards. We will include primary research studies (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and qualitative studies) recruiting more than 10 adult participants admitted to ICUs, high dependency units and weaning centres regardless of length of stay, describing quality improvement tools such as structured care plans or checklists designed to standardize more than one aspect of care delivery. We will extract data on study and patient characteristics, tool design and implementation strategies and measured outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen citations for eligible studies and perform data extraction. Data will be synthesised with descriptive statistics; we will use a narrative synthesis to describe review findings.

Manufacturers provide lists of the side effects of their products. Adverse reactions are proof of the effectiveness of vaccines and that the immune system is responding. In this study, we compare the side effects of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. Our survey results show that the side effects of the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine are more common than after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most respondents in our survey reported at least one side-effect after the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccine, but these reactions were less common after the Pfizer preparation. PATIENTS AND METHODS A survey was distributed via the internet. It was conducted among people vaccinated with Pfizer or AstraZeneca. The respondents were asked about the side effects after the first and second doses of the vaccines, such as injection site pain, arm pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, and fatigue. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 705 people. 196 of them had been vaccinated with Pfizer and 509 with AstraZeneca. Among those vaccinated with the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, 96.5% reported at least one post-vaccination reaction. 17.1% of respondents reported all the side effects listed in the survey. Among those vaccinated with the first Pfizer dose, vaccine reactions were reported by 93.9% of respondents; 2% of respondents experienced all the side effects mentioned in the survey. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine caused post-vaccinal reactions in most of the subjects: 54.8% of respondents had more adverse reactions, and 15.8% had fewer adverse reactions than after the first dose of this vaccine; 29.4% experienced the same side effects after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. CONCLUSIONS Side effects as a result of vaccination are not rare and are proof that the immune system is responding. However, severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be dangerous, and they engender fear.

Two waves of COVID-19 infections were examined with cross-correlation analysis. In the first wave, all four indicators of going out reacted oppositely with the change in new PCR positive cases, showing a lag period of -1 to +6 weeks. In the second wave, the same relationship was only observed for the index of web searches for going outside.

DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING A survey was distributed to 292 HCWs (ie, internal medicine house staff, pulmonary and critical care fellows and faculty members, nurses, and respiratory care professionals) at 2 hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland. RESULTS Of the 292 HCWs, 256 (88%) completed the survey. Just over one-half of the respondents believed there is at least a 45% chance of an influenza pandemic within the next 5 years. However, only 41% reported knowing how to protect themselves during an outbreak.

Surgical acuity changed with 61% of all cases performed as inpatient transfers after cardiology admission in contrast with a 40% rate in 2019. Valve surgery continued at 89% of the expected rate; coronary artery bypass surgery was performed at 61% of the expected rate and major aortic surgery at 22%. Adult congenital heart cases were not performed in March or April 2020. One heart and one lung transplant were performed in this period. CONCLUSIONS: In March and April of 2020, the spread of COVID-19 and the resultant focus on its management resulted in a reduction in cardiothoracic surgery service delivery.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery and transplant services in Irelands National Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The restrictive measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic modified some previously consolidated drug use patterns. A focus on social networks allowed drug users to discuss, share opinions and provide advice during a worldwide emergency context. In order to explore COVID-19-related implications on drug trends/behaviour and on most popular psychotropic substances debated, the focus here was on the constantly updated, very popular, Reddit social platforms posts and comments. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of r/Drugs and related subreddits, using a social media listening netnographic approach, was carried out. The post/comments analysed covered the time-frame December 2019CMay 2020. Between December 2019 and May 2020, the number of whole r/Drugs subreddit members increased from 619,563 to 676,581 members, respectively, thus increasing by 9.2% by the end of the data collection. Both the top-level r/Drugs subreddit and 92 related subreddits were quantitatively analysed, with posts/comments related to 12 drug categories. The drugs most frequently commented on included cannabinoids, psychedelics, opiates/opioids, alcohol, stimulants and prescribed medications. The qualitative analysis was carried out focussing on four subreddits, relating to some 1685 posts and 3263 comments. Four main themes of discussion (e.g., lockdown-associated immunity and drug intake issues; drug-related behaviour/after-quarantine plans issues; lockdown-related psychopathological issues; and peer-to-peer advice at the time of COVID-19) and four categories of Redditors (e.g., those continuing the use of drugs despite the pandemic; the couch epidemiologists; the conspirationists/pseudo-science influencers; and the recovery-focused users) were tentatively identified here. A mixed-methods, social network-based analysis provided a range of valuable information on Redditors drug use/behaviour during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been shown to identify lung cancer at an earlier stage. A risk stratified approach to LDCT referral is recommended. Those at higher risk of developing lung cancer (aged 55 + , smoker, deprived area) are least likely to participate in such a programme and, therefore, it is necessary to understand the barriers they face and to develop pathways for implementation in order to increase uptake. METHODS: A 2-phased co-design process was employed to identify ways to further increase opportunity for uptake of a lung cancer screening programme, using a risk indicator for LDCT referral, amongst people who could benefit most. Participants were members of the public at high risk from developing lung cancer and professionals who may provide or signpost to a future lung cancer screening programme. Phase 1: interviews and focus groups, considering barriers, facilitators and pathways for provision. Phase 2: interactive offline booklet and online surveys with professionals. Qualitative data was analysed thematically, while descriptive statistics were conducted for quantitative data. RESULTS: In total, ten barriers and eight facilitators to uptake of a lung cancer screening programme using a biomarker blood test for LDCT referral were identified. An additional four barriers and four facilitators to provision of such a programme were identified. These covered wider themes of acceptability, awareness, reminders and endorsement, convenience and accessibility. Various pathway options were evidenced, with choice being a key facilitator for uptake. There was a preference (19/23) for the provision of home test kits but 7 of the 19 would like an option for assistance, e.g. nurse, pharmacist or friend. TV was the preferred means of communicating about the programme and fear was the most dominant barrier perceived by members of the public. CONCLUSION: Co-design has provided a fuller understanding of the barriers, facilitators and pathways for the provision of a future lung cancer screening programme, with a focus on the potential of biomarker blood tests for the identification of at-risk individuals. It has also identified possible solutions and future developments to enhance uptake, e.g. Embedding the service in communities, Effective communication, Overcoming barriers with options. Continuing the process to develop these solutions in a collaborative way helps to encourage the personalised approach to delivery that is likely to improve uptake amongst groups that could benefit most.","output":"Increasing uptake to a lung cancer screening programme: building with communities through co-design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The subject of this paper is the evaluation of the position of women entrepreneurs in Serbia in the aftermath of COVID19 outbreak.

Of 120 postgraduate students approached, 109 completed three self-report scales regarding those constructs. Correlation, regression and moderation analyses were performed. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation were positively associated with engagement, whereas amotivation was negatively associated with it. Engagement positively predicted intrinsic motivation. Self-criticism and self-compassion moderated the pathway from extrinsic motivation to intrinsic motivation: higher self-criticism weakened the pathway, while higher self-compassion strengthened it. Findings suggest the importance of engagement in relation to cultivating intrinsic motivation of education students.

It considers the various contributions of the special issue and shows how the Treaty emerged in an era of shifting cleavages, disputed steps towards a more political Union and rising populism. This legacy has led to more polarisation and politicisation - a phenomenon that the Treaty of Lisbon struggles to encapsulate and conciliate with the culture of consensus and compromise inherent to its institutional structures. As a result, we observe a bias towards policy stability - and even failure - that affects the legitimacy and democratic standards of the European Union. In a context of polycrisis, the difficulty to find compromises - especially in highly normative issues - leads to the de-politicisation of the EU and reinforces the gap between EU institutions and its citizens.

The characterization and understanding of the inflammatory metabolic pathways involved into volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production could bring exhaled breath analysis into clinical practice and thus open new therapeutic routes for inflammatory diseases. In this study, lung inflammation was simulated in vitro using A549 epithelial cells. We compared the VOC production from A549 epithelial cells after a chemically induced oxidative stress in vitro, exposing the cells to H2O2, and a biological stress, exposing the cells to an inflammatory pool of sputum supernatants. Special attention was devoted to define proper negative and positive controls (8 different types) for our in vitro models, including healthy sputum co-culture. Sputum from 25 asthmatic and 8 healthy patients were collected to create each pool of supernatants. Each sample type was analyzed in 4 replicates using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCGC-TOFMS). This approach offers high resolving power for complex VOC mixtures. According to the type of inflammation induced, significantly different VOCs were produced by the epithelial cells compared to all controls. For both chemical and biological challenges, an increase of carbonyl compounds (54%) and hydrocarbons (31%) was observed. Interestingly, only the biological inflammation model showed a significant cell proliferation together with an increased VOC production linked to asthma airway inflammation. This study presents a complete GCGC-TOFMS workflow for in vitro VOC analysis, and its potential to characterize complex lung inflammatory mechanisms.","output":"Comparison of the effect of chemically and biologically induced inflammation on the volatile metabolite production of lung epithelial cells by GCGC-TOFMS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

The data come from a nationally representative sample survey of 1,569 American adults. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between socioeconomic position, concern and knowledge about the threat, social networks for health advice or health care seeking, health consultations with doctors, and NPIs (including individuals social distancing behaviors and hygiene practices) and vaccine acceptance. Results. People with higher scores on health-related social networks, more knowledge or concern about A(H1N1), and those who have consulted their doctor were more likely than others to adopt NPIs. There was a significant association between being concerned about A(H1N1), having consulted a doctor, and seeking a vaccine. Conclusions. These findings suggest that interpersonal communication factors, such as health-related social networks and consultations with doctors, and intrapersonal factors, such as concern and knowledge, play a critical role in NPIs and vaccine uptake during pandemics and offer avenues for intervention.","output":"Facing a Health Threat in a Complex Information Environment: A National Representative Survey Examining American Adults Behavioral Responses to the 2009/2010 A(H1N1) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 2, 2020, Saudi Arabia identified the first positive COVID-19 case.

The objective of this study is to describe the pattern and characteristics of Emergency Department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic period, compared with the same period in the previous year, including the patients demographic information, acuity level, length of stay, and admission rate. METHODS: Data were collected from King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The health records of all the patients who presented at the Emergency Department from January 2019 to September 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The variations in the patient and the visit characteristics were described for the periods before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: The records of 209,954 patients who presented at the Emergency Department were retrieved. In contrast to 2019, the number of visits during the pandemic period reduced by 23%. A dramatic decrease was observed after the announcement of the first COVID-19 diagnosed case in Saudi Arabia, and subsequently the numbers gradually increased. The patients who presented at the Emergency Department during the pandemic period were slightly older (mean age, 43.1 versus 44.0 years), more likely to be older, more urgent and had a higher admission rate compared to the pre-pandemic period. There was a slight increase in visits during the daytime curfew hours and a decrease during the nighttime. CONCLUSION: We report a considerable decrease in the number of Emergency Department visits. The reduction was higher in non-urgent and less urgent cases.

This study is an evaluation of students' (N = 33 912) SRL and integration in remote learning in Finnish lower secondary schools when educational institutions all over the world were urgently closed and teaching was arranged in remote settings due to COVID-19. Neither the teachers nor the students had time to prepare themselves for the transition, resulting in variations in coping. To learn from experiences during the pandemic, we evaluated students' remote learning experiences by using a nationally representative survey. Results of SEM reveal that students better preparedness for SRL and positive experiences related to clear guidelines and encouraging feedback from teachers predict more time invested in studying. Surprisingly, regulation of peer learning during remote learning period had the strongest correlation with positive experiences, indicating the need for social interaction when schools were closed. Moreover, results show that girls and non-binary students were slightly more concerned about the amount and quality of support for learning during remote learning compared to boys. Overall, when teaching is implemented via technology, students should not be left to cope with the skills they have, but instead, strategies to regulate their learning should be taught consistently. Opportunities for peer learning need to be kept in mind as they can easily be forgotten when students study online.

According to the course of the pandemic, governments encouraged best practices and then ruled out temporary restrictions on daily lives. In this scenario, non-essential labor-intensive sectors were forced to put on hold operations producing massive temporary layoffs. In gradually restoring the economic activities, governments passed several laws to passively mitigate the pathogen transmission in indoor working environments. However, several COVID19-related injuries were filled by manufacturing companies. According to the outlined conditions, this paper proposes an original and advanced hardware and software architecture to prevent the COVID19 transmission in indoor production environments. The aim is to increase the safety of whichever indoor productive workplace through a contact tracing approach. Indoor positioning systems due to their ability to accurately track the movement of tagged entities compose the hardware part. For this purpose, human operatives are equipped with adequate wearable sensors. Raw data acquired are properly mined through advanced algorithms to quantitatively assess the degree of safety of any working setting. Indeed, having as a reference the epidemiological evidence the software part defines an innovative risk index along two correlated dimensions. While the first defines the risk of any worker getting infected during the shift, the other one expresses the degree of COVID19-safety of the shop floor defined by the displacements of the anchors. Benefitting from these targeted and quantitative hints, plant supervisors may redesign the production settings to lower the chances of COVID19 infection.

For this, tests of statistical significance are used, provided that the errors obey the same distribution. If the test statistic exceeds the specified threshold, the hypothesis that the distributions are identical is rejected.

It is well known that melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) are key regulators of appetite and energy homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the GPCR partners of MC3R and MC4R are not well understood. Our objective is to analyze single cell RNA-seq datasets of the hypothalamus to explore and identify novel GPCR partners of MC3R and MC4R and examine the pharmacological effect on the downstream signal transduction and membrane translocation of melanocortin receptors. METHODS: We conducted an integrative analysis of multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets to reveal the expression pattern and correlation of GPCR families in the mouse hypothalamus. The emerging GPCRs with important metabolic functions were selected for cloning and co-immunoprecipitation validation. The positive GPCR partners were then tested for the pharmacological activation, competitive binding assay and surface translocation ELISA experiments. RESULTS: Based on the expression pattern of GPCRs and their function enrichment results, we narrowed down the range of potential GPCR interaction with MC3R and MC4R for further confirmation. Co-immunoprecipitation assay verified 23 and 32 novel GPCR partners that interacted with MC3R and MC4R in vitro. The presence of these GPCR partners exhibited different effects in the physiological regulation and signal transduction of MC3R and MC4R.

We aimed to describe GHE in these schools and determine whether some may teach GH concepts without labeling them as such. METHODS In 2019, 161 Chinese medical schools eligible for accreditation by the Ministry of Education were invited to complete a questionnaire as part of a national survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, Chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and logit models. RESULTS Approximately 57% of schools completed the survey (n = 93). 33 (35.5%) indicated that GHE was included in the curriculum. Although the majority of responding schools reported the absence of GH in the curriculum, GH topics were identified at many institutions. Schools affiliated with the central government or an aspiring world-class university were more likely to report the inclusion of GHE and offered more opportunities at international away sites. CONCLUSIONS Chinese medical schools are frequently teaching GH topics, but may not label the instruction as such.

Those patients usually underwent a stage of excessive inflammation before developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we test the hypothesis that short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids would benefit patients when used in the early phase of excessive inflammation, namely, the therapeutic window. Among a Shanghai cohort and a validation cohort, we enrolled COVID-19 patients showing marked radiographic progression. Short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids were considered for them. After identifying the possible markers for the therapeutic window, we then divided the patients, based on whether they were treated with corticosteroids within the therapeutic window, into the early-start group and control group. We identified that the therapeutic window for corticosteroids was characterized by a marked radiographic progression and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) less than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The Shanghai cohort comprised of 68 patients, including 47 in the early-start group and 21 in the control group. The proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly lower in the early-start group than in the control group (10.6% vs. 33.3%, difference, 22.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.6-44.8%).

The fixation of mesh through penetrating techniques using staples, clips or screws is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing a post-herniotomy pain syndrome. AIM To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the self-fixating anatomical Parietex ProGrip laparoscopic mesh (Sofradim Production, Trvoux France) used with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair. The incidence of chronic post-herniotomy pain and recurrence rate in the follow-up after 12 months were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data analysis included all patients who underwent inguinal hernia surgery at our Surgical Department within the period from 1.05.2013 to 31.12.2014, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Standard surgical technique was used. Data were prospectively entered and subsequently analyzed on the Herniamed platform. Herniamed is an internet-based register in German and English language and includes all data of patients who underwent surgery for some types of hernia. RESULTS There were 95 patients enrolled in the group and there were in total 156 inguinal hernias repaired. The mean follow-up was 15.52 months. At the assessment at 1 year mild discomfort in the groin was reported in 2 patients (3.51%) (1-3 VAS). No recurrence or chronic postoperative pain was reported. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair using the transabdominal preperitoneal technique with implantation of the ProGrip laparoscopic mesh is a fast, effective and reliable method in experienced hands, which according to our results reduces the occurrence of chronic post-operative inguinal pain with simultaneously a low recurrence rate.","output":"Reduction of chronic post-herniotomy pain and recurrence rate.

None of the isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and the definitive species identification was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No reference spectra of the Anaerococcus species were present in the MALDI-TOF MS database. Eight isolates were finally identified as A. octavius, one isolate as A. tetradius and the other as A. urinomassiliensis. The majority of these infections were seen in patients aged >70 years. Risk factors for anaerobic infection were observed in eight patients, especially diabetes mellitus, surgery, and the presence of cancer. Fever was present in all patients. Three patients died, but only one death was attributed to the infection. Mean detection time of positive blood cultures was 47.5 h. (range 24-92 h.). Antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam was tested using the gradient diffusion technique and EUCAST breakpoints (except for moxifloxacin). No resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole, imipenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam was detected; however, the majority of isolates were resistant to clindamycin.

Although MT has been utilized in various medical treatments based on its potential role for increasing the blood flow to the local muscle, a quantitative validation of local muscle blood flow in MT remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate bedside evaluation techniques. Therefore, we investigated changes in the local blood flow to the muscle undergoing MT by employing diffuse correlation spectroscopy, a portable and emerging optical measurement technology that non-invasively measures blood flow in deep tissues. This study investigated the changes in blood flow, heart rate, blood pressure, and autonomic nervous activity in the trapezius muscle through MT application in 30 volunteers without neck and shoulder injury. Five minutes of MT significantly increased the median local blood flow relative to that of the pre-MT period (p < 0.05). The post-MT local blood flow increase was significantly higher in the MT condition than in the control condition, where participants remained still without receiving MT for the same time (p < 0.05). However, MT did not affect the heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac autonomic nervous activity. The post-MT increase in muscle blood flow was significantly higher in the participants with muscle stiffness in the neck and shoulder regions than in those without (p < 0.05).

It was suggested that preoperative diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS) could increase the IVR rate after RNU. However, the available data are often conflicting. Thus, in this systematic review and meta-analysis we sought to synthesize available data for the impact of pre-RNU URS for UTUC on IVR and other oncological outcomes. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed in June 2021. Cumulative analyses of hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were conducted. The primary endpoint was intravesical recurrence-free survival (IVRFS), with the secondary endpoints being cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Results: Among a total of 5489 patients included in the sixteen selected papers, 2387 (43.4%) underwent diagnostic URS before RNU and 3102 (56.6%) did not. Pre-RNU diagnostic URS was significantly associated with worse IVRFS after RNU (HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29C1.61, p < 0.001) than RNU alone. However, subgroup analysis including patients without biopsy during URS revealed no significant impact of diagnostic URS on IVRFS (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.90C1.80, p = 0.16). The results of other analyses showed no significant differences in CSS (HR = 0.94, p = 0.63), OS (HR: 0.94, p = 0.56), and MFS (HR: 0.91, p = 0.37) between patients who underwent URS before RNU and those who did not. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis confirm that diagnostic URS prior to RNU is significantly associated with worse IVRFS, albeit with no concurrent impact on the other long-term survival outcomes. Our results indicate that URS has a negative impact on IVRFS only when combined with endoscopic biopsy. Future studies are warranted to assess the role of immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy in patients undergoing biopsy during URS for suspected UTUC.","output":"The Impact of Diagnostic Ureteroscopy Prior to Radical Nephroureterectomy on Oncological Outcomes in Patients with Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 commonly designated as COVID-19 has been declared by World health Organisation (WHO) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

The present study investigates outcomes with respect to cardiopulmonary arrest rates in institutions with and without rapid response systems (RRSs) and the current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate in tertiary hospitals. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on data from 14 tertiary hospitals. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate reports were obtained from each hospital to include the number of cardiopulmonary arrest events in adult patients in the general ward, the annual adult admission statistics, and the structure of the RRS if present. RESULTS: Hospitals with RRSs showed a statistically significant reduction of the CPR rate between 2013 and 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577 to 0.927; P = 0.009). Nevertheless, CPR rates of 2013 and 2015 did not change in hospitals without RRS (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.868 to 1.124; P = 0.854). National university-affiliated hospitals showed less cardiopulmonary arrest rate than private university-affiliated in 2015 (1.92 vs. 2.40; OR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020).

Predicting future outbreaks or epidemics disease based on past incidence data can help health departments take targeted measures to prevent diseases in advance. In this study, we propose a multistep prediction strategy based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for HFRS as an extension of the one-step prediction model. Moreover, the fitting and prediction accuracy of the XGBoost model will be compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model by different evaluation indicators. METHODS: We collected HFRS incidence data from 2004 to 2018 of mainland China. The data from 2004 to 2017 were divided into training sets to establish the seasonal ARIMA model and XGBoost model, while the 2018 data were used to test the prediction performance. In the multistep XGBoost forecasting model, one-hot encoding was used to handle seasonal features. Furthermore, a series of evaluation indices were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the multistep forecast XGBoost model. RESULTS: There were 200,237 HFRS cases in China from 2004 to 2018. A long-term downward trend and bimodal seasonality were identified in the original time series. According to the minimum corrected akaike information criterion (CAIC) value, the optimal ARIMA (3, 1, 0)  (1, 1, 0)(12) model is selected. The index ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE, and MASE indices of the XGBoost model were higher than those of the ARIMA model in the fitting part, whereas the RMSE of the XGBoost model was lower. The prediction performance evaluation indicators (MAE, MPE, MAPE, RMSE and MASE) of the one-step prediction and multistep prediction XGBoost model were all notably lower than those of the ARIMA model. CONCLUSIONS: The multistep XGBoost prediction model showed a much better prediction accuracy and model stability than the multistep ARIMA prediction model. The XGBoost model performed better in predicting complicated and nonlinear data like HFRS. Additionally, Multistep prediction models are more practical than one-step prediction models in forecasting infectious diseases.

Low response rate, although not unexpected due to the circumstances, limits the generalization of findings. The present data suggest that in addition to issues related to contagion and specific restricted measures to contain the spread of the disease, the personal reorganization of life required to maintain activities at home and work can be an important contributor to pandemic-related psychological distress.","output":"Longitudinal Distress among Brazilian University Workers during Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate an outbreak of COVID\\\\19 in Sydney, Australia. Methods: Epidemiological linking and analysis of cases of COVID\\\\19 across multiple outbreak sites. Results: Fifteen cases of COVID\\\\19 and 41 contacts were identified and linked in a cluster that included one workplace and five households. The mean incubation period in the cases ranged from 4.6 to 6.4 days, while the median incubation period was shorter, ranging from 3 to 5 days. The overall range of incubation periods was 2 to 12 days. Differential attack rates were found within households (86% adults vs. 9% children) and workplace (32%) settings. Conclusions and implications for public health: Our investigation links cases between multiple households and a workplace. When exploring these links using a rapid workplace assessment, real\\\\time cluster data along with objective measurements of exposure, such as with the Australian Government COVIDSafe app, may have allowed these links to be identified more readily and potentially reduced further spread of COVID\\\\19.

Drastic changes in daily lives as a result of lockdown may expose individuals to high stress levels, which might make them vulnerable to mental health issues. It is important to identify and understand these difficulties, which can help mental health professionals and policy makers address these issues. Aim: The present study aimed to screen mental health problems and to gain insight into resilience among Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Materials and Methods: The study was cross sectional, using online survey method. Sociodemographic datasheet, a self-designed questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire and Brief Resilience Scale were entered into Google Form, and was sent using E-mails and WhatsApp to the personal contacts of the investigators. The link was also posted in social media groups. The participants were requested to complete the survey and then forward the link to their contacts. Inclusion criteria laid for the study included English speaking males and females, 18 years or older, and living in India. A total of 348 individuals filled in the forms, of which 327 were complete and included for analysis. Results: Fifty percent of the participants surveyed had symptoms of common mental disorders. Thirty-three percent had elevated scores needing diagnostic evaluation for somatoform disorder, 33% for generalized anxiety disorder, and 35% for depression. 8% reported developing interpersonal difficulties with family members, 17% reported financial stress, 23.5% were worried about job loss, and 35% found the lockdown very stressful. Elevated scores on patient health questionnaire-somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were associated with financial stressors, worries about job loss, and lockdown stress. Ten percent of the participants indicated a need to talk to psychologist, and 40% were not aware of tele counselling facilities. Higher resilience was associated with lower odds of developing psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: The results offer preliminary data-based insight into the impact of the lockdown, and are suggestive of increased stress and mental health liabilities. Fostering resilience may be critical to prevent or reduce mental health problems in general population during the pandemic.","output":"Stress, mental health, and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Preliminary findings of an online survey in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 initially emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.","output":"Acceptance of a Symptom-Based Approach for COVID-19 rtRT-PCR Testing to Conserve Resources in a Lower Middle-Income Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 disease has reduced the loading of anthropogenic aerosols. However, AOD distribution over South Asia during the lockdown period shows a dipole pattern: reduction over North Indian and enhancement over the Myanmar region. This dipole pattern is evident in some datasets (MODIS, MERRA, and CALIPSO). MODIS fire counts collocated with CALIPSO smoke aerosols show enhancement over Myanmar indicating the contribution from fires. However, over the North India region number of fires during the lockdown period are less compared to climatology. Thus, the observed reduction in AOD is due to fires and anthropogenic sources. Our analysis shows that aerosols originating from biomass burning forms a layer (900C600 hPa) over the Myanmar region that produces atmospheric heating (0C2.8 K/day) that eventually leads to cloud dissipation/burning (negative in-atmospheric cloud radiative forcing  ?13 W/m2) and precipitation reduction (?1 to ?4 mm) over Myanmar. In contrast, the aerosol reduction over North India favors cloud formation, that is, increase in cloud cover and reduction in specific cloud liquid water content leading to precipitation enhancement, indicating the anti-Twomey effect.

While a cadre of willing and able health workers is essential for an effective epidemic response, health workforce capacity in times of crisis may be significantly impacted by how risks are perceived by health staff. This study aimed to explore how risk perceptions influenced healthcare workers willingness to respond during this outbreak. METHODS: Through in-depth interviews with 11 front-line international health care workers who chose to respond to the West Africa outbreak, this qualitative study explores how perceptions of risk developed and subsequently mediated the decision to respond to the outbreak. Data was thematically organized using NVivo 10. RESULTS: We found that numerous individual and social-level factors played a role in modifying risk perception in health workers. Institutional trust emerged as a key risk attenuator, as did past experience, self-efficacy, duty of care, humanitarian ethos, and cognitive heuristics. Feelings of risk were amplified by infections of co-workers, and risk perceptions of family members and the public, which were mainly informed by media reports, also hampered willingness to respond in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the risk perceptions of health workers, institutions, and the public, while complex and interdependent, are each crucial to understand for an effective public health response to epidemics, and as such should be taken into consideration in future program planning and research.","output":"The role of risk perception in willingness to respond to the 2014C2016 West African Ebola outbreak: a qualitative study of international health care workers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a total of 55 928 327 confirmed cases and 1 344 003 deaths as of November 19, 2020 But so far the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes this pandemic has remained undetermined The purpose of this study is to review the current research of SARS-CoV-2 and the existing problems therein, which may provide inspiration for further researches Existing evidence suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be derived from bat coronavirus 40-70 years ago During the evolution, this virus underwent extensive variations in the process of mutations and natural selection Different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 may have different selection pressures, but all of which increase the difficulty of tracing the origin of this virus A wide variety of animals have been considered as potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2, including cats, lions, tigers, dogs and minks SARS-CoV-2 has a chance to transmit from humans to animals and can be transmitted among animals Current research evidence has shown that China is not the original source of SARS-CoV-2 It is still unclear how the virus spreads to human, and efforts are still need to be made to explore the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its hosts and intermediate hosts, and the mechanism of its transmission across different species of animals","output":"[Progress in source tracking of SARS-CoV-2]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-COV-2 virus pandemic is a challenge for healthcare across the globe. Although COVID-19 is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, the collateral damage caused by this disease might influence patients with cardiovascular disease, especially acute coronary syndromes (ACS) very prone to treatment delay and lack of infrastructure and staff availability. Additionally lock-down causes patients concern and reluctance which further delays the invasive. treatment. PURPOSE: In our report we sought to analyse the incidence and course of ACS patients following the first wave of COVID-19 pandemy in Poland. METHODS: The report represents multiinstitutional registry, with 10 interventional cardiology departments included. The data was gathered from a timeframe separating two waves of the pandemy (June-October), which reflects the situation directly following the first lockdown in Poland (30 March- 31 May 2020) and limitations in planned medical care. The data was compared to same timeframe in year 2019. Patients who were admitted with ACS were included. In hospital outcome was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 2801 patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome in 2019 (Jun-Oct) and 2620 in 2020 (Jun-Oct), which is respectively 52.8% and 57.9% of coronary artery disease admissions (p<0.0001). Patient baseline characteristics and in hospital outcomes are presented in table 1. In 2020 patient presented more often with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and smoking history when compared to 2019. However, myocardial infarction was more frequent in 2019. There was a visible trend for higher mortality in 2020. More patient were admitted with acute heart failure in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic affects both ACS patient profile and course of treatment, which became apparent already after first wave of pandemic. Patient admitted after lockdown has more risk factors, there was a trend toward higher mortality and patient presented more often with acute heart failure, more likely due to delay in treatment or no invasive treatment for MI.

Little is known about the prevalence and pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children affected by SARS-CoV-2. Dehydration seems to be the most common trigger factor, and meticulous attention to fluid status is imperative. The principles of initiation, prescription, and complications related to renal replacement therapy are the same for coronavirus disease (COVID) patients as for non-COVID patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains the most common modality of treatment. When to initiate and what modality to use are dependent on the available resources. Though children are less often and less severely affected, diversion of all hospital resources to manage the adult surge might lead to limited CRRT resources. We describe how these shortages might be mitigated. Where machines are limited, one CRRT machine can be used for multiple patients, providing a limited number of hours of CRRT per day. In this case, increased exchange rates can be used to compensate for the decreased duration of CRRT. If consumables are limited, lower doses of CRRT (15C20 mL/kg/h) for 24 h may be feasible. Hypercoagulability leading to frequent filter clotting is an important issue in these children. Increased doses of unfractionated heparin, combination of heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation, or combination of prostacyclin and heparin might be used. If infusion pumps to deliver anticoagulants are limited, the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin might be considered. Alternatively in children, acute peritoneal dialysis can successfully control both fluid and metabolic disturbances. Intermittent hemodialysis can also be used in patients who are hemodynamically stable. The keys to successfully managing pediatric AKI in a pandemic are flexible use of resources, good understanding of dialysis techniques, and teamwork.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury and Special Considerations during Renal Replacement Therapy in Children with Coronavirus Disease-19: Perspective from the Critical Care Nephrology Section of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing healthcare services commands the largest allocation of public funding on both sides of the Irish border and concerns over the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems are perennial Over the past two decades health has been identified as a key area for cross-border collaboration However, in the absence of an overarching framework or strategy, there is little clarity about objectives Using the responses to the Covid-19 pandemic as a case study it demonstrates that even in the face of an existential crisis, political leaders default to debates over culture and identity The paper sets out how the healthcare systems in the two jurisdictions share similar core principles and values and face similar social, economic and political pressures They have adopted broadly comparable approaches to tackling systemic issues, such as an ageing and growing population, evolving healthcare needs, work-force planning and financial pressures It argues that there is potential for greater cross-border cooperation but this requires high-level political agreement and must be based on robust evidence As this paper shows, there are significant barriers to developing all-island approaches, but these are not insurmountable ? 2021, Royal Irish Academy All rights reserved","output":"Cross-border cooperation health in ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compare the expected all-cause mortality with the observed one for different age classes during the pandemic in Lombardy, which was the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy.

Historically, given the differences in corporate profit tax rates across jurisdictions, companies have manipulated pricing to reduce their total tax burden. With advanced economies shifting to the innovation-intensive knowledge-based mode in the post-1980 period, taxing returns to capital became even more challenging since intangible capital assets can be parked in a low tax jurisdiction of choice. Furthermore, this rise of the intangibles economy has posed numerous governance problems, including how we measure economic activity, how we classify products, and importantly how and where economic returns are booked C and thus where and how they are taxed. The rise of the intangibles economies has led to a significant erosion of corporate tax revenue in the innovation-intensive advanced economies, even as the share of national income flowing to capital rose. For developing countries, the erosion is worse and comes on top of substantial erosion of corporate tax revenues from the tangibles economy due to weak tax administration and corruption. However, addressing the erosion would likely have significant redistributive impacts across economies, thereby creating political economy problems for designing and implementing reforms. The intangibles economy thus clearly poses a taxing problem that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the digital transformation, thereby escalating the problems facing governments in taxing intangibles, while at the same time blowing large holes in public finances thereby making it all the more urgent to stop the erosion. In this paper, we take up the following questions: how big is the taxing problem, whose problem is it, and the prospects for success of the various approaches to addressing, including inter alia the various digital services taxes that have been proposed or implemented and the proposed OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. We conclude that the importance of tax reform in the modern digitalizing economy goes beyond preventing base erosion and profit shifting for it is about sustainable development and future prosperity.

METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among the general Greek population from 11th September to 7th October 2020 after institutional ethics approval, using a non-probability, convenience sampling method. The survey consisted of socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude, and perception questions towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statistical analyses conducted were appropriate according to the type of variable and the research question. RESULTS: We collected a total of 9,309 questionnaires with a completeness rate estimated at 98.3 %. The median knowledge score regarding COVID-19 was 72.7 %, exhibiting variation depending on socio-demographic subgroups. Individuals were better informed about coronavirus modes of transmission (86.4 %). The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population was 25.9 %, while 43 % of participants remained undecided about being vaccinated. A significant part of the respondents experienced a health issue for which they had to visit a hospital, but they did not do so due to the fear of possible infection by SARS-CoV-2.

All cases had clear contact histories, primarily from Guangdong or Hong Kong. The second stage resulted in a large outbreak in a municipal hospital, and quickly spread to northern and southern Taiwan from late April to mid-June. During this stage, there were some sporadic cases with untraceable contact histories. To investigate the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV in Taiwan's epidemic, we conducted a systematic viral lineage study by sequencing the entire viral genome from ten SARS patients. SARS-CoV viruses isolated from Taiwan were found closely related to those from Guangdong and Hong Kong. In addition, all cases from the second stage belonged to the same lineage after the municipal hospital outbreak, including the patients without an apparent contact history. Analyses of these full-length sequences showed a positive selection occurring during SARS-CoV virus evolution. The mismatch distribution indicated that SARS viral genomes did not reach equilibrium and suggested a recent introduction of the viruses into human populations.

Until now, most psychosocial research in dementia has focused either on the person with dementia (PWD) or the caregiver separately. The previous literature examining relationship characteristics and their role in outcomes for the caregiver and PWD is scant and suffers from methodological issues that limit the understanding of which relationship characteristics most influence outcomes for caregivers and care-receivers and what other factors may mitigate or exacerbate their effects. METHODS We will enroll 300 dyads and collect information via online interviews of each member of the couple, every 6 months for 3 years. Relationship characteristics will be measured with a set of short, well-validated, and reliable self-report measures, plus the newly developed \\"Partnership Approach Questionnaire.\\" Outcomes include global quality of life, subjective physical health, mental health (depression and anxiety), and status change (transitions in levels of care; i.e., placement in a nursing home). Longitudinal data will be used to investigate how relationship characteristics are affected by cognitive, functional, and behavioral changes, and the impact of these changes on health outcomes. Qualitative data will also be collected to enrich the interpretation of results of quantitative analyses. DISCUSSION Psychosocial interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting the wellbeing of PWD and their caregivers.

Various online courses were created and the utilisation by the students was analyzed. Material & methods: Examination videos, surgical images and videos were created and live lectures were held. In addition, patient cases of common otorhinolaryngological diseases were reconstructed on an interactive platform. A total of 16 cases were offered in weekly rotation. These cases are provided with gap texts, open and selection questions, links and videos and thematically appropriate digression offers. The time-consuming creation was carried out as a HTML 5 learning package with the authoring program Exelearning 2.5. Each case was to be evaluated separately after being worked on by the students. Results: The direct feedback and the evaluation results of the students on the internship and case presentations were consistently positive. However, on average only 50.72% of the registered students took part in the weekly video meetings. In the course of the semester, the willingness to participate decreased. In addition, the willingness to evaluate the patient cases was low. Discussion: With the case presentation tool, concrete patient examples can be well presented, especially when patient contact is not possible (especially in an ENT clinic due to violation of distance and hygienic rules). Even though the evaluations were positive in terms of content, the frequency of utilisation and also the motivation for feedback seems disappointing. This seems to be associated above all with an increasing return to everyday life after the end of the lockdown.","output":"Digital teaching with interactive case presentations of ENT diseases - discussion of utilisation and motivation of students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interprofessional and intraprofessional collaboration in crises situations in the intensive care unit regarding COVID-19 - a qualitative, retrospective analysis Abstract. Background: Interprofessional collaboration is elementary in the intensive care unit, a success factor in difficult patient situations and complex therapies. The COVID-19-pandemic challenged newly composed treatment teams, however, experience does not exist. Aim: We analyzed personal experiences and views on inter- and intraprofessional collaboration in intensive care units during the COVID-19-pandemic and identified influencing factors. Methods: We used a qualitative, retrospective study design, collected data from physicians, nurses in intensive care, anesthesia and surgery and physiotherapists during group discussions using the story / dialogue method. We analyzed the data according to Mayring's Qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified two main categories, each with three sub-categories: 1. Mastering a exceptional situation actively (Recognizing a common goal; Acting in solidarity; Getting to know each other in inter- / intraprofessional collaboration), 2. Having overcome the exceptional situation in retrospect (Maintaining personal contacts; Gaining new knowledge and perspectives; Taking what has been learned into the future). The participants rated the interprofessional and intraprofessional collaboration as good to very good.

METHODS: Excess age-specific mortality during periods of influenza activity was evaluated in Israel during the period 1999C2006 for three death categories. For each respiratory year, the lowest monthly moving average for the mortality rate was subtracted from each month in the period of influenza activity. Average mortality rates in years with minimal influenza activity were deducted from corresponding months to exclude winter mortality unrelated to influenza. The sums of these results were used as estimates of excess mortality rates. RESULTS: Overall excess mortality rates ranged from 7.7 to 36.1 per 100,000 for all causes, and from 4.4 to 24.4 per 100,000 for respiratory and circulatory causes. Influenza was associated with an average of 869 (range 280C1,516) deaths annually from respiratory and circulatory diseases during seasons with significant influenza activity. About 90% of the influenza-associated mortality from respiratory and circulatory diseases was in the age group 65+ years and about 1% in the age group <50 years. The age group <50 years accounted for an annual average of seven deaths from respiratory and circulatory diseases. CONCLUSION: Annual mortality associated with seasonal influenza is highly variable. Under the age of 50 years, there is minimal seasonal influenza associated mortality. This information provides an important baseline for evaluating the severity of the A(H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic, where persons under 50 years of age were often disproportionately represented.","output":"Excess mortality from seasonal influenza is negligible below the age of 50 in Israel: implications for vaccine policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomaterials offer elegant frameworks to uncover mysteries of biology and vital tools to treat diseased or damaged tissues.

The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.","output":"Statistical Decision Properties of Imprecise Trials Assessing COVID-19 Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The incidence and the clinical presentation of neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear No data regarding the use of neuromonitoring tools in this group of patients are available Methods: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data The primary aim was to assess the incidence and the type of neurological complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients and their effect on survival as well as on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay The secondary aim was to describe cerebral hemodynamic changes detected by noninvasive neuromonitoring modalities such as transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and automated pupillometry Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU from February 28 to June 30, 2020, were included in this study Fifty-three patients underwent noninvasive neuromonitoring Neurological complications were detected in 50% of patients, with delirium as the most common manifestation Patients with neurological complications, compared to those without, had longer hospital (36 8  25 1 vs 19 4  16 9 days, p &lt; 0 001) and ICU (31 5  22 6 vs 11 510 1 days, p &lt; 0 001) stay The duration of mechanical ventilation was independently associated with the risk of developing neurological complications (odds ratio 1 100, 95% CI 1 046-1 175, p = 0 001) Patients with increased intracranial pressure measured by ONSD (19% of the overall population) had longer ICU stay Conclusions: Neurological complications are common in critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and are associated with prolonged ICU length of stay Multimodal noninvasive neuromonitoring systems are useful tools for the early detection of variations in cerebrovascular parameters in COVID-19","output":"Neurological Complications and Noninvasive Multimodal Neuromonitoring in Critically Ill Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19, is a highly contagious viral disease associated with acute, severe respiratory syndrome, which is based on the development of pronounced thrombo-inflammatory syndrome.

We first compared the distinctive protein fingerprints of local inflammation in synovial fluid with systemic profiles within matched plasma samples. The synovial fluid proteome at the time of joint inflammation was then evaluated across clinical subgroups to identify early disease associated proteins. We measured the synovial fluid and plasma proteomes using the two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis approach. Image analysis software was used to highlight the expression levels of joint and subgroup associated proteins across the study cohort (n =32). A defined subset of 30 proteins had statistically significant differences (p <0.05) between sample types such that synovial fluid could be differentiated from plasma. Furthermore distinctive synovial proteome expression patterns segregate patient subgroups. Protein expression patterns localized in the chronically inflamed joint therefore have the potential to identify patients more likely to suffer disease which will spread from a single joint to multiple joints. The proteins identified could act as criteria to prevent disease extension by more aggressive therapeutic intervention directed at an earlier stage than is currently possible.","output":"Comparative analysis of synovial fluid and plasma proteomes in juvenile arthritis C Proteomic patterns of joint inflammation in early stage disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative agent of a global outbreak of respiratory tract disease (COVID-19). In some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with common cold coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.","output":"Phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. SETTINGS: Clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing students from nine Belgian nursing schools. METHODS: All students enrolled in nursing education are eligible to participate. The survey consists of five dimensions: demographics, risk perception, self-efficacy, support and communication, and resilience. RESULTS: The gaps that were identified by students focused on the need for more psychosocial support, establishing (regular) contact with their clinical placement supervisor, recognition of the difficult work situation, and the need for more space to unwind. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students expressed a strong need to be heard, prepared, and supported. Most students felt supported by their nursing schools. Because of COVID-19, the role of the preceptor became more important. However, due to several reasons, the perceptor did not always meet the student's expectations. Preparing students for specific competencies is needed. In spite of the efforts of nursing schools and clinical sites, students often got lost in the chaos of the pandemic. This resulted in practical worries, fewer learning opportunities, and even fundamental doubts about their choice to become a nurse. Finally, it crucial that nursing schools and clinical sites communicate about matters such as the responsibility for testing nursing students, the provisions of uniforms and personal protective equipment, and structurally sharing guidelines with students to provide safe patient care.","output":"Clinical placement experience of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

AIM To explore bereaved relatives' experiences of quality of care and family support provided during the last days of life; to identify the impact of factors associated with perceived support. DESIGN A national, observational, open online survey was developed and disseminated via social media, public fora and professional networks (June-September 2020). Validated instruments and purposively designed questions assessed experiences. Analysis used descriptive statistics, logistic regression and thematic analysis of free-text responses. PARTICIPANTS Individuals (?18 years) who had experienced the death of a relative/friend (all care settings) within the United Kingdome during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Respondents (n = 278, mean 53.4 years) tended to be female (n = 216, 78%); over half were 'son/daughter' (174, 62.6%) to the deceased. Deceased individuals (mean 81.6 years) most frequently died in their 'usual place of care' (n = 192, 69.3%). Analysis established five conceptual themes affecting individualised care: (1) public health restrictions compounding the distress of 'not knowing'; (2) disparate views about support from doctors and nurses; (3) challenges in communication and level of preparedness for the death; (4) delivery of compassionate care; (5) emotional needs and potential impact on grief. Male respondents (OR 2.9, p = 0.03) and those able to visit (OR 2.2, p = 0.04) were independently associated with good perceptions of family support.

Survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ARDS are at risk of considerably impaired physical function that can persist for years. An early pathogenic mechanism of lung injury in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrin deposition, leading to thrombosis of the microvasculature and hyaline membrane formation in the air sacs. The main aim of this study was to determine if nebulised heparin, which targets fibrin deposition, would limit lung injury and thereby accelerate recovery of physical function in patients with or at risk of ARDS. METHODS: The Can Heparin Administration Reduce Lung Injury (CHARLI) study was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial across nine hospitals in Australia. Adult intensive care patients on invasive ventilation, with impaired oxygenation defined by a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of less than 300, and with the expectation of invasive ventilation beyond the next calendar day were recruited. Key exclusion criteria were heparin allergy, pulmonary bleeding, and platelet count less than 50 X 10(9)/L. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, with stratification by site and using blocks of variable size and random seed, via a web-based system, to either unfractionated heparin sodium 25 000 IU in 5 mL or identical placebo (sodium chloride 09% 5 mL), administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 h to day 10 while invasively ventilated. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function Score (out of 100) of survivors at day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, included development of ARDS to day 5 among at-risk patients, deterioration of the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) to day 5, mortality at day 60, residence of survivors at day 60, and serious adverse events. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. There was no imputation of missing data. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612000418875 . FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Aug 23, 2018, 256 patients were randomised. Final follow-up was on Feb 25, 2019. We excluded three patients who revoked consent and one ineligible participant who received no intervention. Of 252 patients included in data analysis, the mean age was 58 years (SD 15), 157 (62%) were men, and 118 (47%) had ARDS. 128 (51%) patients were assigned to the heparin group and 124 (49%) to the placebo group, all of whom received their assigned intervention. Survivors in the heparin group (n=97) had similar SF-36 Physical Function Scores at day 60 compared to the placebo group (n=94; mean 536 [SD 316] vs 487 [357]; difference 49 [95% CI ?48 to 145]; p=032). Compared with the placebo group, the heparin group had fewer cases of ARDS develop to day 5 among the at-risk patients (nine [15%] of 62 patients vs 21 [30%] of 71 patients; hazard ratio 046 [95% CI 022 to 098]; p=00431), less deterioration of the MLIS to day 5 (difference ?014 [C026 to ?002]; p=00215), similar day 60 mortality (23 [18%] of 127 patients vs 18 [15%] of 123 patients; odds ratio [OR] 129 [95% CI 066 to 253]; p=046), and more day 60 survivors at home (86 [87%] of 99 patients vs 73 [73%] of 100 patients; OR 245 [118 to 508]; p=00165). A similar number of serious adverse events occurred in each group (seven [5%] of 128 patients in the heparin group vs three [2%] of 124 patients in the placebo group; OR 233 [059 to 924]; p=023), which were a transient increase in airway pressure during nebulisation (n=3 in the heparin group), major non-pulmonary bleeding (n=2 in each group), haemoptysis (n=1 in the heparin group), tracheotomy site bleeding (n=1 in the heparin group), and hypoxaemia during nebulisation (n=1 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with or at risk of ARDS, nebulised heparin did not improve self-reported performance of daily physical activities, but was well tolerated and exploratory outcomes suggest less progression of lung injury and earlier return home. Further research is justified to establish if nebulised heparin accelerates recovery in those who have or are at risk of ARDS.

Here, we observed delayed induction and reduced magnitude of vaccine induced antibody titers in children 5-11 years receiving two doses of the age recommended 10 g dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine compared to adolescents (12-15 years) or adults receiving the 30 g dose. Conversely, children mounted equivalent or more robust neutralization and opsonophagocytic functions at peak immunogenicity, pointing to a qualitatively more robust humoral functional response in children. Moreover, broad cross-variants of concern responses were observed across children, with enhanced IgM and parallel IgG cross-reactivity to variants of concern (VOCs) in children compared to adults. Collectively, these data argue that despite the lower magnitude of the BNT162b2 induced antibody response in children, vaccine induced immunity in children target VOCs broadly and exhibit enhanced functionality that may contribute to attenuation of disease.","output":"BNT162b2 induces robust cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 immunity in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, febrile, viral disease of small ruminants that has a significant economic impact. For many viral diseases, vaccination with virus-like particles (VLPs) has shown considerable promise as a prophylactic approach; however, the processes of assembly and release of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) VLPs are not well characterized, and their immunogenicity in the host is unknown. In this study, VLPs of PPRV were generated in a baculovirus system through simultaneous expression of PPRV matrix (M) protein and hemaglutin in (H) or fusion (F) protein. The released VLPs showed morphology similar to that of the native virus particles. Subcutaneous injection of these VLPs (PPRV-H, PPRV-F) into mice and goats elicited PPRV-specific IgG production, increased the levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, and promoted lymphocyte proliferation. Without adjuvants, the immune response induced by the PPRV-H VLPs was comparable to that obtained using equivalent amounts of PPRV vaccine. Thus, our results demonstrated that VLPs containing PPRV M protein and H or F protein are potential differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccine candidates for the surveillance and eradication of PPR.","output":"Self-Assembly and Release of Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus-Like Particles in an Insect Cell-Baculovirus System and Their Immunogenicity in Mice and Goats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erratum In the JanuaryCFebruary 2022 issue, the essay by Lawrence O.

DVA victims attending hospital are often at highest risk of harm, yet DVA support in hospitals has been inadequate. A targeted service supportinghigh risk DVA victims, was implemented at a hospital Trust in North West England. The service was provided by Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs).An evaluation exploredthe processes and outcomes associated with the service. The evaluation coincided with the COVID-19 pandemicand societal restrictions (lockdown), during which concern about DVA increased. This paper examines the hospital-based IDVA service during the COVID-19 period and addresses the research questions: What was the demand for the service? How did the service respond? What facilitated this response? Methods: A mixed-methods study was undertaken. Quantitative data on referrals to the service were examined using simple descriptive statistics and compared to other DVA services.Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with IDVAs and other hospital staff involved with the service and the data subjected to thematic analysis. Results: The quantitative analysis showed that referrals dropped at the start of lockdown, then increased and continued to rise;the qualitative findings reiterated this pattern. Referrals came from a range of departments across the Trust, with the majority from A&E. Pre-pandemic, the population supported by the service included higher proportions of males and people aged 40 and over than atother IDVA services;this continuedduring the pandemic. The qualitative findings indicated an effective, flexible response during the pandemic, enabled by strong working relationships and by using workarounds. Conclusions: The hospital-based IDVA service provided a robust response to victims during the COVID-19 pandemic. Referrals increased during the firstlockdown and subsequent relaxing of restrictions. Locating the IDVAswithina team working across the organisation, and building good working relationships facilitatedan effective disclosure and referral route, which endured through social restrictions. The IDVAs supported high-risk victims who may otherwise not have been identified in traditional community-based DVA settings during the pandemic. Hospital-based IDVA services can broaden accessby supporting vulnerable, at risk populations whose needs may not be identified at other services.","output":"A Hospital-Based Independent Domestic Violence Advisor Service: Demand and Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAlthough high vaccine effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines was reported in studies in several countries, data is limited from Asian countries, especially against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant.

Vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated. Waning immunity among patients aged 16 to 64 was also assessed. ResultsWe enrolled 1936 patients, including 396 test-positive cases and 1540 test-negative controls for SARS-CoV-2. The median age was 49 years, 53.4% were male, and 34.0% had underlying medical conditions. Full vaccination (receiving two doses []14 days before symptom onset) was received by 6.6% of cases and 38.8% of controls. Vaccine effectiveness of full vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 88.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.8-93.9) among patients aged 16 to 64 and 90.3% (95% CI, 73.6-96.4) among patients aged []65.

Previous work showed that salivary gland tissue-resident CD8(+) T cells elicited by viruses were poorly functional ex vivo. Using a model of persistent murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, we now show that CD8(+) T cells in the salivary gland and other non-lymphoid tissues of mice express multiple molecules associated with T cell exhaustion including PD-1, CD73 and CD39. Strikingly however, these molecules were expressed independently of virus or antigen. Rather, PD-1-expressing T cells remained PD-1(+) after migration into tissues regardless of infection, while CD73 was activated on CD8(+) T cells by TGF- signaling. Blockade of PD-L1, but not CD73, improved cytokine production by salivary gland T cells ex vivo and increased the expression of granzyme B after stimulation within the salivary gland. Nevertheless, salivary-gland localized CD8(+) T cells could kill PD-L1-expressing targets in vivo, albeit with modest efficiency, and this was not improved by PD-L1 blockade. Moreover, the impact of PD-L1 blockade on granzyme B expression waned with time. In contrast, the function of kidney-localized T cells was improved by CD73 blockade, but was unaffected by PD-L1 blockade. These data show that tissue localization per se is associated with expression of inhibitory molecules that can impact T cell function, but that the functional impact of this expression is context- and tissue-dependent.","output":"Inhibitory Molecules PD-1, CD73 and CD39 Are Expressed by CD8(+) T Cells in a Tissue-Dependent Manner and Can Inhibit T Cell Responses to Stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Food preferences are often modified in populations during stressful, unanticipated events.

The collaborative care model (CoCM) has robust evidence for clinical effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. However, evidence from real-world implementation of CoCM is necessary to inform its expansion in low-resource settings. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year mixed-methods study to assess the implementation and clinical impact of CoCM using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme protocols in a primary care clinic in rural Nepal. We used the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) implementation research framework to adapt and study the intervention. To assess implementation factors, we qualitatively studied the impact on providers' behaviour to screen, diagnose and treat mental illness. To assess clinical impact, we followed a cohort of 201 patients with moderate to severe depression and determined the proportion of patients who had a substantial clinical response (defined as &#8805;50% decrease from baseline scores of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to measure depression) by the end of the study period. RESULTS: Providers experienced improved capability (enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge), greater opportunity (via access to counsellors, psychiatrist, medications and diagnostic tests) and increased motivation (developing positive attitudes towards people with mental illness and seeing patients improve) to provide mental healthcare. We observed substantial clinical response in 99 (49%; 95% CI: 42% to 56%) of the 201 cohort patients, with a median seven point (Q1:-9, Q3:-2) decrease in PHQ-9 scores (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Using the COM-B framework, we successfully adapted and implemented CoCM in rural Nepal, and found that it enhanced providers' positive perceptions of and engagement in delivering mental healthcare. We observed clinical improvement of depression comparable to controlled trials in high-resource settings. We recommend using implementation research to adapt and evaluate CoCM in other resource-constrained settings to help expand access to high-quality mental healthcare.","output":"Collaborative care model for depression in rural Nepal: a mixed-methods implementation research study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Japanese idol culture, meet-and-greet events where fans were allowed to handshake with an idol member for several seconds were regarded as its essential component until the spread of COVID-19. Now, idol groups are struggling in the transition of such events to computer-mediated communication because these events had emphasized meeting face-to-face over communicating, as we can infer from their length of time. I anticipated that investigating this emerging transition would provide implications because their communication has a unique characteristic that is distinct from well-studied situations, such as workplace communication and intimate relationships. Therefore, I first conducted a quantitative survey to develop a precise understanding of the transition, and based on its results, had semi-structured interviews with idol fans about their perceptions of the transition. The survey revealed distinctive approaches, including one where fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from the idol member by an acrylic plate and talked via a video call. Then the interviews not only provided answers to why such an approach would be reasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap between conventional offline events and emerging online events in their perceptions. Based on the results, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support this transition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture, such as computer-mediated performing arts.","output":"No More Handshaking: How have COVID-19 pushed the expansion of computer-mediated communication in Japanese idol culture?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic disease coupled with kidney dysfunction is increasing worldwide. This triad of disorders is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality as well as a substantial economic burden. Further understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is important to develop novel preventive or therapeutic approaches. Among the proposed mechanisms, compromised nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity associated with oxidative stress is considered to be important. NO is a short-lived diatomic signalling molecule that exerts numerous effects on the kidneys, heart and vasculature as well as on peripheral metabolically active organs. The enzymatic l-arginine-dependent NO synthase (NOS) pathway is classically viewed as the main source of endogenous NO formation. However, the function of the NOS system is often compromised in various pathologies including kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. An alternative pathway, the nitrateCnitriteCNO pathway, enables endogenous or dietary-derived inorganic nitrate and nitrite to be recycled via serial reduction to form bioactive nitrogen species, including NO, independent of the NOS system. Signalling via these nitrogen species is linked with cGMP-dependent and independent mechanisms. Novel approaches to restoring NO homeostasis during NOS deficiency and oxidative stress have potential therapeutic applications in kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.","output":"Nitric oxide signalling in kidney regulation and cardiometabolic health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, an unprecedented public global health emergency caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in national governments' imposing confinement measures.

The dearth of evidence on OV in the Eastern Mediterranean Region poses a knowledge gap requiring research to improve rights-based and respectful health practice and policy. While efforts to improve the quality of maternal health have long-existed, women's experiences of childbirth and perceptions of dignity and respect are not adequately or systematically recorded, especially in the said region. AIM: This study centered on the experiences of women's mistreatment in childbirth to provide an overview of OV and offer recommendations to improve RMC. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted, and a total of 38 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed using Bowser and Hill's framework of the seven typologies of Disrespect and Abuse (D&A) in childbirth. D&A in childbirth (or violations to RMC) is a manifestation of OV and served as a proxy to analyze its prevalence in the EMR. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: This study indicated that across the EMR, women experienced every type of D&A in childbirth. This happens regardless of health systems' strength or country's income, with 6 out of 7 types of D&A found in almost two-thirds of included countries. In the EMR, the most common types of D&A in childbirth are physical abuse (especially overused routine interventions) and non-dignified care (embedded in patriarchal socio-cultural norms). The intersections of these abuses enable the objectification of women's bodies and overuse of unconsented routine interventions in a hierarchical and patriarchal system that regards the power and autonomy of doctors above birthing women. If unchecked, the implications include acceptance, continuation, and underreporting of D&A in childbirth, as well as passivity toward human-rights violations, which all further cause the continuing the cycle of OV. CONCLUSION: In order to eliminate OV, a paradigm shift is required involving infrastructure changes, education, empowerment, advocacy, a women-centered and gender-sensitive approach to health system strengthening, and policy development. Recommendations are given at individual, community, health systems, and policy levels to ensure that every woman achieves her right to health and birth in a dignified, respectful, and empowered manner.","output":"Exposing Obstetric Violence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: A Review of Women's Narratives of Disrespect and Abuse in Childbirth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacting the way we learn;information and communication technologies (ICTs) play an ever-increasing role in young childrens learning making it crucial to understand the importance and challenges of using ICTs in kindergartens from teachers perspectives.

Current regenerative approaches implement exogenous systems, including stem cells, scaffolds, growth factors, and plasmid DNA/viral vectors, that induce variable clinical outcomes. An innovative approach that is safe, effective, and inexpensive is needed. The lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) platform has proven to be a successful vaccine modality against coronavirus disease 2019, demonstrating safety and high efficacy in humans. The same fundamental technology platform could be applied to facilitate the development of mRNA-based regenerative therapy. While the platform has not yet been studied in the field of oral tissue regeneration, mRNA therapeutics encoding growth factors have been evaluated and demonstrated promising findings in various models of soft and hard tissue regeneration such as myocardial infarction, diabetic wound healing, and calvarial and femoral bone defects. Because restoration of both soft and hard tissues is crucial to oral tissue physiology, this new therapeutic modality may help to overcome challenges associated with the reconstruction of the unique and complex architecture of oral tissues. This review discusses mRNA therapeutics with an emphasis on findings and lessons in different regenerative animal models, and it speculates how we can apply mRNA-based platforms for oral tissue regeneration.","output":"The Impact of mRNA Technology in Regenerative Therapy: Lessons for Oral Tissue Regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses unexpected challenges to social and healthcare systems worldwide.

However, there is still little research exploring this issue. This study aimed to characterize telework during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal and to identify the major predictors of telework satisfaction. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study aimed at all teleworkers working in Portugal, during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Data were collected through a Google Forms platform online questionnaire distributed by a snowball method on social networks. Descriptive statistics included crude and relative frequency data. The associations between sociodemographic characteristics, self-perceived health, organization of working time, concentration at work, work-life balance, work disconnection, working conditions, and organizational demands (flexibility and organizational trust based on E-work Life Scale) with telework satisfaction were estimated through logistic regression. RESULTS: This study included 1004 participants. Teleworkers satisfaction levels were high (69%). Better concentration at work (OR = 1.54; 95%CI 1.01C2.34); the satisfaction with the balance between work life and extra work when teleworking (OR = 1.79; 95%CI 1.17C2.74); and higher work flexibility (OR = 2.26; 95%CI 1.46C3.49) were good predictors of greater levels of satisfaction with telework. However, its major predictors were the companys trust in teleworkers (OR = 4.50; 95%CI 2.89C7.02) and feeling good in the workspace at home (OR = 3.72; 95%CI 1.46C9.49). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point that work environment and organizational culture play a crucial role in affecting telework satisfaction. More studies are needed to monitor telework satisfaction and its effects on physical and mental health, so that Public and Occupational Health (and Safety) can be able to identify and implement the best interventions that allow promoting individual health and foster a healthy work environment for teleworkers.","output":"Telework during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal and determinants of job satisfaction: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the outbreak of novel coronavirus in December 2019, lockdown has been identified as the only effective measure across the world to stop the community spread of this pandemic. India implemented a complete shutdown across the nation from March 25, 2020 as lockdown I and went on to extend it by giving timely partial relaxations in the form of lockdown II, III & IV. This paper statistically analyses the impact of relaxation during Lockdown III and IV on coronavirus disease (COVID) spread in India using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to forecast the number of active cases using time series analysis and hence the required medical infrastructure for the period of next six months. The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it.","output":"Assessment of impact of relaxation in lockdown and forecast of preparation for combating COVID-19 pandemic in India using Group Method of Data Handling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: While disparities in COVID-19 infections and mortality have been documented for older Black and Latinx populations, pandemic-related economic impacts have been less studied for these groups. Minoritized older adults may be particularly vulnerable to financial hardships given their precarious socioeconomic positions. Thus, we aim to highlight the devastating economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic recession on older Black and Latinx adults, with a particular focus on the foreign-born population. METHODS: This study used data from the 2020 COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study. The sample included adults >50 years of age who were U.S.-born non-Latinx White and Black, U.S.-born Latinx, and foreign-born Latinx (n=2,803). We estimated age-standardized prevalence and means of variables indicating financial impact and economic hardship during the pandemic. We further examined differences in these measures across racial/ethnic and nativity groups. RESULTS: Our findings document stark racial/ethnic inequalities in the pandemics economic impact on older adults. Results show the pandemic has negatively affected older Black and Latinx adults across a host of economic factors (e.g., paying bills, affording health-related needs, or purchasing food), with foreign-born Latinx experiencing greater economic hardships relative to other groups. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, older Black and Latinx adults are experiencing disparate economic effects, including lacking money to cover basic needs, compared to older White adults. The implications of the economic shocks of the pandemic for the health and well-being of older Black and Latinx adults warrant policy-oriented action towards promoting equity.","output":"The Devastating Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Older Black and Latinx Adults: Implications for Health and Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated attempts to curb its spread have led to a significant increase in mental health issues. Evidence suggests that sleep provides a protective resilience against the adverse effects of stress. Moreover, sleep disruption is often considered the hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here we hypothesized that insomnia would increase during the first six months of the pandemic, and that higher insomnia would be associated with elevated rates of PTSD. METHODS: A total of 6,190 adults ranging in age from 18 to 84 years (53.6% female), completed an online cross-sectional survey at one of six time points between April and September 2020 (~1,000 per administration). Instruments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Primary Care PTSD Checklist (PC-PTSD), and the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5). Standard clinical cutoffs were used for ISI (10) and PCL-5 (38). Data were analyzed with analysis of variance, chi-square contingency tables, and bivariate correlations. RESULTS: Over the first six-months of the pandemic, PTSD increased with each passing month on both the PC-PTSD (p=.001) and PCL-5 (p<.0001). Similarly, ISI scores increased month-by-month (p<.0002). Insomnia scores were highly correlated with PCL-5 PTSD scores (r=.62, p<.0001), even when sleep items on the scale were excluded (r=.60, p<.0001). Finally, the rate of PTSD remained below 5% across all months for those without insomnia, but among those with insomnia, the prevalence of PTSD increased between May (26% positive) and September (40% positive), representing an increase of 56% over the data collection period (interaction p=.0004). CONCLUSION: Both insomnia and PTSD have increased dramatically over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, insomnia appears to be highly linked with the emergence of PTSD during this time. While it is not possible to make causal attributions from these cross-sectional findings, the steadily increasing rates of PTSD over time only among those with insomnia, raise the possibility that sleep disruption could act as a diathesis for the development of PTSD symptoms in response to the pandemic. Addressing insomnia during the pandemic may be an important aspect of maintaining psychological resilience in the populace.

Therefore, systemic elucidation of compatibility mechanism using in vivo comparative exposure is particularly crucial to improve the safety dose window of Shenfu prescriptions. A high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed for quantification of 11 aconitines in SD rat plasma within 9 min, and a systemic comparison with their pharmacokinetic characteristics after oral administration of a safe dosage of 2 g/Kg of Fuzi and Ginseng-Fuzi decoction for 24 h was conducted.

In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (N = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, womens COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function.

Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of TET2 gene mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms. The findings may be helpful for future research, diagnoses and the identification of better therapeutic strategies to manage the diseases. ABSTRACT: Multiple recurrent somatic mutations have recently been identified in association with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This meta-analysis aims to assess the pooled prevalence of TET2 gene mutations among patients with MPN. Six databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Embase) were searched for relevant studies from inception till September 2020, without language restrictions. The eligibility criteria included BCR-ABL-negative MPN adults with TET2 gene mutations. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses explored results among different continents and countries, WHO diagnostic criteria, screening methods and types of MF. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020212223). Thirty-five studies were included (n = 5121, 47.1% female). Overall, the pooled prevalence of TET2 gene mutations in MPN patients was 15.5% (95% CI: 12.1C19.0%, I(2) = 94%).

A negotiated immune system is a common risk factor for all viral infections, including COVID-19. To date, no specific therapies or vaccines have been approved for coronavirus. In these circumstances, antiviral and immune boosting foods may ensure protection against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2 by reducing risk and ensuring fast healing of SARS-CoV-2 illness. SCOPE AND APPROACH: In this review, we have conducted an online search using several search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to find out some traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species), which have antiviral and immune-boosting properties against numerous viral infections, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs) and others RNA-virus infections. Our review indicated some foods to be considered as potential immune enhancers, which may help individuals to overcome viral infections like COVID-19 by modulating immune systems and reducing respiratory problems. Furthermore, this review will provide information regarding biological properties of conventional foods and their ingredients to uphold general health. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed some foods with antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which possess bioactive compounds that showed significant antiviral properties against different viruses, particularly RNA viruses such as CoVs. Interestingly, some antiviral and immune-boosting mechanisms were very much similar to the antiviral drug of COVID-19 homologous SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The transient nature and the devastating spreading capability of COVID-19 lead to ineffectiveness of many curative therapies.

We anticipated low evidence quality; therefore, a standardised evaluation was not performed. RESULTS We explored 68 articles and 99 web resources. After reviewing the full text, 12 scientific articles and 11 web resources were included. As general guidelines, we found that the most frequent suggestion is the design of a specific structured mental health programme within universities, one that should be multidisciplinary, inclusive, dynamic and culturally sensitive. All actions taken by the university should be reported and published periodically so that students and other members of the university community are clear about them. Ideally, it is suggested to keep them until the post-pandemic period and include alumni. Regarding a) promotion and prevention, digital psychoeducation was recommended, with information about healthy lifestyles, common emotional reactions to epidemics, coping strategies and warning signs. Peer participation is suggested as a support strategy, as well as spaces for social interaction that focus not only on academic aspects but also on leisure. Screening for mental symptoms is suggested through frequent submission of online forms or mobile applications. In addition to mental health, it is important to inquire about the degree of satisfaction of basic and technology-related needs. For b) the care of mental symptoms, one of the actions commonly identified was a consulting centre that can provide mental health care by telephone, by technology, and even in person --if required --, with permanent availability with rapid response teams for crisis situations, such as suicidal behaviour and domestic violence. For c) pedagogical adaptations, fluent communication is an indispensable requirement; having clear instructions on academic activities can reduce uncertainty and therefore anxiety. The teaching and pedagogical staff at the institution can offer direct advice (via video calls or online group meetings) to provide support in study habits, degree-specific material and mental health. CONCLUSIONS Included resources suggest the creation of a programme that specifically addresses the mental health of students. This synthesis can provide guidelines that facilitate decision-making by the university, without losing sight of the fact that the institution and the student are immersed in a complex context, with circumstances and other actors at various levels that also intervene in mental health. Research is required on the evolution of the mental health situation and the effect of the actions that are being taken.","output":"Mental health interventions for college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a critical synthesis of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Covidization of research: what are the risks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 incidence and case fatality rates (CFR) differ among ethnicities, stimulating efforts to pinpoint genetic factors that could explain these phenomena.

In old age, high metallothionein (I+II) (MT) sequesters a substantial number of intracellular zinc ions consequently leading to low zinc ion bioavailability for an adequate immune response. Corticosterone and IL-6 affect MTmRNA induction in inflammation and after pHx against oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by MT in conferring immune plasticity in ageing and in very old age using the pHx model. 48 h after their partial hepatectomy, the crude zinc balance was negative in young, old and very old mice coupled with increased MT, corticosterone, sIL-6R and IL-6. Concomitantly, Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and IL-2 production decreased. Complete restoration of the nutritionalCendocrineCimmune parameters occurred 15 days from the surgical procedures in young and very old mice, but not in old or transgenic mice overexpressing MT. A significant positive or inverse correlation among nutritionalCendocrineCimmune parameters exists in young and very old mice, but not in old mice during liver regeneration. Since MT also affects c-myc, the gene expression of c-myc declines from 48 h to days 7 and 15 after pHx in young and very old mice, but remains constantly high in old pHx mice for the same days. This circumstance leads to the appearance of tumours in the long run in old pHx mice and survival times that are shorter than old sham controls. Because complete remodelling also occurs in IL-6 and in sIL-6R in very old mice during liver regeneration, the pre-existing inflammation is not detrimental in very old age. As such, very old mice are still responsive to large inflammation, such as pHx, thanks to correct MT homeostasis. Correct MT homeostasis, via c-myc, is therefore pivotal in both suitable liver regeneration and in conferring immune plasticity with subsequent successful ageing. High MT plays an extremely harmful role in ageing: on one hand it lowers zinc ion bioavailability levels required for immune efficiency and on the other hand it increases c-myc expression. The combination of immune depression and enhanced c-myc, via high MT, may trigger the appearance of age-related degenerative diseases.","output":"Metallothionein (I+II) confers, via c-myc, immune plasticity in oldest mice: model of partial hepatectomy/liver regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory gene therapy has been considered for the treatment of a broad range of pulmonary disorders.

This analysis aimed to compare descriptively the extent to which influenza surveillance systems were adapted and enhanced and how COVID\\\\19 surveillance could ultimately benefit or disrupt routine influenza surveillance. METHODS: We used a previously developed framework in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom to describe COVID\\\\19 surveillance and its impact on influenza surveillance. The framework divides surveillance systems into seven subsystems and 20 comparable outcomes of interest and uses five evaluation criteria based on WHO guidance. Information on influenza and COVID\\\\19 surveillance systems were collected from publicly available resources shared by European and national public health agencies. RESULTS: Overall, non\\\\medically attended, virological, primary care and mortality surveillance were adapted in most countries to monitor COVID\\\\19, although community, outbreak and hospital surveillance were reinforced in all countries. Data granularity improved, with more detailed demographic and medical information recorded. A shift to systematic notification for cases and deaths enhanced both geographic and population representativeness, although the sampling strategy benefited from the roll out of widespread molecular testing. Data communication was greatly enhanced, contributing to improved public awareness.

Thromboembolic events have a higher incidence among patients with COVID-19, but there are few reports on the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (PubMed), the Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for case-control studies that included data on vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 and were published in English, between January 1 and July 25, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the included data were confirmed, the prognoses of patients with and without concurrent thromboembolic events were compared, and the odds ratio (OR) was used as the effect size. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (2,030 patients) were included. Thromboembolic events complicated a total of 609 COVID-19 patients. The combined OR of the mortality of COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic events was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.13-3.27), that of ICU treatment rate was 2.63 (95% CI: 1.49-4.67), and that of treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.14 (95% CI: 1.97-5.02).

METHODS An EGFR-specific Affibody molecule, ZEGFR:1907, and its dimeric form, (ZEGFR:1907)2, were labeled with 111In using benzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and with 125I using p-iodobenzoate. Affinity and cellular retention of conjugates were evaluated in vitro. Biodistribution of radiolabeled Affibody molecules was compared in mice bearing EGFR-expressing A431 xenografts. Specificity of EGFR targeting was confirmed by comparison with biodistribution of non-EGFR-specific counterparts. RESULTS Head-to-tail dimerization of the Affibody molecule improved the dissociation rate. In vitro, dimeric forms demonstrated superior cellular retention of radioactivity. For both molecular set-ups, retention was better for the 111In-labeled tracer than for the radioiodinated counterpart. In vivo, all conjugates accumulated specifically in xenografts and in EGFR-expressing tissues. The retention of radioactivity in tumors was better in vivo for dimeric forms; however, the absolute uptake values were higher for monomeric tracers.

As a possible consequence, parents often do not dispense optimal analgesic medications to their children after surgery, putting their children at risk of suffering from postsurgical pain. The objective of this research was to assess ethnicity as a predictor of both pain and opioid consumption, and to examine how Hispanic/Latinx and Non-Hispanic White parents alter their child's opioid consumption in response to significant postsurgical pain. METHODS Participants were 254 children undergoing outpatient tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy surgery and their parents. Longitudinal multilevel modeling examined changes in both parent-reported pain and hydrocodone/APAP consumption (mg/kg) on days 1 to 7 after surgery. RESULTS Parent reports of postoperative pain were higher in Hispanic/Latinx patients compared to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts ( = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.01).

Two inbred lines of BB have been used in the majority of published studies using this model system; these rats are designated as diabetes prone (DP-BB/Wor) and diabetes resistant (DR-BB/Wor). This unit presents two protocols for the diagnosis and prevention of spontaneous IDDM in DP-BB/Wor rats. Two alternate protocols are given for the induction of autoimmune disease in DR-BB/Wor rats and for the adoptive transfer of autoimmunity into histocompatible athymic WAG nu/nu recipient rats. Support protocols are also given for diagnosis of insulitis, treatment of diabetic rats with insulin, and serological analysis of blood samples from sentinel rats to monitor the pathogen status of the colony.","output":"The BB rat as a model of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although some intravenous drugs have been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no effective antiviral agents are currently available in the outpatient setting. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of 14-day ciclesonide treatment vs. standard care for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. A randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of ciclesonide inhalers was conducted in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Patients were enrolled within 3 days of diagnosis or within 7 days from symptom onset and randomly assigned to receive either ciclesonide (320 g inhalation twice per day for 14 days) or standard care. The primary endpoint was the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) eradication rate on day 14 from study enrollment. Clinical status was assessed once daily, and serial nasopharyngeal viral load was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. There were 35 and 26 patients in the ciclesonide and standard care groups, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 eradication rate at day 14 was significantly higher in the ciclesonide group (p = 0.021). In multivariate analysis, SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion within 14 days was 12 times more likely in the ciclesonide group (95% confidence interval, 1.187C125.240). Additionally, the clinical failure rate (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation) was significantly lower in the ciclesonide group (p = 0.034). In conclusion, ciclesonide inhalation shortened SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding duration, and it may inhibit the progression to acute respiratory failure in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

These studies identified atovaquone as a promising candidate for inhibiting viral replication. MethodsA 2-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Enrolled patients were randomized 2:1 to atovaquone 1500 mg BID versus matched placebo. Patients received standard of care treatment including remdesivir, dexamethasone, or convalescent plasma as deemed necessary by the treating team. Saliva was collected at baseline and twice per day for up to 10 days for RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. The primary outcome was the between group difference in log-transformed viral load (copies/mL) using a generalized linear mixed-effect models of repeated measures from all samples. ResultsOf the 61 patients enrolled; 41 received atovaquone and 19 received placebo. Overall, the population was predominately male (63%) and Hispanic (70%), with a mean age of 51 years, enrolled a mean of 5 days from symptom onset. The log10 viral load was 5.25 copies/mL vs. 4.79 copies/mL at baseline in the atovaquone vs. placebo group. Change in viral load did not differ over time between the atovaquone plus standard of care arm versus the placebo plus standard of care arm. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of atovaquone plasma concentration demonstrated a wide variation in atovaquone levels, with an inverse correlation between BMI and atovaquone levels, (Rho -0.45, p=0.02). In post hoc analysis, an inverse correlation was observed between atovaquone levels and viral load (Rho -0.54, p= 0.005). ConclusionIn this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, atovaquone did not demonstrate evidence of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance compared with placebo. However, based on the observed inverse correlation between atovaquone levels and viral load, additional PK-guided studies may be warranted to examine the antiviral effect of atovaquone in COVID-19 patients. clincialtrials.gov (NCT04456153).","output":"Atovaquone for Treatment of COVID-19: A Prospective Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two experiments to measure the size of microscopic dielectric spherical particles immersed in purified water with spheres of a nominal diameter 5.2  0.15 m have been carried out in order to revisit Mie scattering techniques.

The distribution of the scattered light intensity is recorded experimentally, and since the theoretical background has been known for several decades (see references), only a modest amount of theory is included. We considered the Mie scattering by a set of spheres of different diameters in our case with a distribution of sphere diameters with mean diameter 5.2 m and standard deviation 0.15 m. Our measured Mie scattering angular distribution accounts for the effect of the diameter distribution, which we assume to be a Gaussian distribution.

Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits both membrane-bound and soluble IL6R and is used to treat inflammatory conditions, including COVID-19. Despite the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 among underserved, racial, and ethnic minority populations, the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients from these populations is unclear. In this work, three genetic markers for the IL6R gene were analyzed across diverse ethnic backgrounds to identify population differences in response to tocilizumab treatment. Genetic structure analyses showed that African populations were significantly different from other described populations. In addition, mapped frequencies of these alleles showed that Sub-Saharan African populations were 3.4x more likely to show an impaired response to tocilizumab than East Asian populations, and 1.8x more likely than European ancestry populations. Existing IL6R genotype results may identify populations at increased therapeutic failure risk. As results from current clinical trials on the efficacy of tocilizumab treatment for extreme COVID-19 infections are conflicting, more studies are needed across diverse patient backgrounds to better understand the genetic factors necessary to predict treatment efficacy.

Methods: Individuals who were pregnant any time since January 2020, the beginning of the pandemic, were invited to participate in an online, national US survey (EuroQol grant: 260-2020RA). Respondents were asked to self-report their experiences with COVID-19, to complete the EQ-5D-5L, and other measurements of HRQoL. To estimate the association between COVID-19 infection with the EQ-5D-5L outcomes, we used median regression for the EQ-5D utility and EQ-VAS scores, and ordinal logistic regressions for the EQ-5D-5L health items. Post-stratification weights were used to ensure representation by age, race and US census region. Results: Among pregnant or postpartum persons, the median EQ-5D-5L utility score was 0.87 and EQ-VAS was 0.80. The median EQ-5D-5L utility score increased by 0.0058 (95% CI 0.0026, 0.009) for each additional year of age of the respondent. We observed no change in EQ-5D-VAS utility measures by maternal age (?= 0.00;95% CI -0.09, 0.09). On average, comparing Black pregnant persons to White, EQ-5D-5L utility values were 0.44 points lower, and EQ-5D-VAS scores were 0.31 points lower. Although median EQ-5D-5L utility values were similar for those with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.87 and 0.88), utility values declined by 0.022 (95% CI -0.040, -0.010) for each unit increase in perceived COVID-19 severity.

Monitoring of changes in trade policy in the context of the spread of COVID-19 allowed to identify groups of countries that have introduced restrictive measures in trade policy: in 24 countries no export-import restrictions were introduced, in 19 countries indirect measures were implemented to protect the economy. To offset the negative effects on business, governments are developing aid packages to support it. These are mainly the following instruments: loans at reduced rates, the grace period for the payment of tax liabilities, cash grants. It was established that only some developing countries impose temporary foreign trade restrictions to avoid shortages in the domestic market. Most countries use other economic incentives to mitigate the effects of a pandemic. Ukraine is implementing economic measures and temporary trade restrictions to counter the pandemic. In particular, the Government of Ukraine introduced temporary restrictions on exports with the establishment of a zero quota for alcohol, buckwheat and anti-epidemic goods. The alcohol export ban not only did not worsen the situation on Ukraine's foreign markets, but also marked almost triple their extension.

DATA AND METHODS A two-part model was applied to estimate smoking participation, smoking intensity price and income elasticity. The first part of the model applies logit regression, while the second uses Deaton's model to improve the validity and objectivity of conditional (smoking intensity) elasticity results. A generalised linear model (GLM) was applied to verify robustness. The reason for this is that Deaton's model is commonly used in the analysis of Household Budget Survey (HBS) data, especially when households do not report the market price. Moreover, using this model, it is possible to capture the shading of quality to price change. The analysis used HBS data (2006-2017). RESULTS The estimates indicate that tobacco pricing policies had a much higher impact on smoking prevalence in the low-income group (price elasticity of -0.595) relative to the high-income group (price elasticity of -0.344). The same conclusion could be drawn for the smoking intensity elasticity: the high-income group was the least affected by changes in price (price elasticity of -0.258). At the same time, the most affected was the low-income group, with price elasticity of -0.424. Poorer households spent a larger share of their budget on cigarettes. The simulation results confirm that increases in the specific excise taxes of 58.3% on tobacco would reduce total cigarette consumption by 11.25% while increasing the collection of government revenue by 8.07%. CONCLUSION Smoking prevalence and consumption are very responsive to price and income changes, with considerable differences in elasticities between income groups. The taxation policy has a positive impact on changing patterns of consumption and public revenues across each income group. Low-income and middle-income households would benefit the most, while on the other hand, the highest revenue collection was generated from the wealthiest group. Our results align with results obtained so far for other low-income and middle-income countries.

INTERVENTIONS: The authors collected demographic, mechanical ventilation, imaging, laboratory, and outcome data. Primary outcome was the incidence of PNX/PMD. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of PNX/PMD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PNX/PMD occurred in a total of 28 patients (24.1%), with 22 patients developing PNX (19.0%) and 13 developing PMD (11.2%). Mean time to development of PNX/PMD was 14  11 days from intubation. The authors found no significant difference in mechanical ventilation parameters between patients who developed PNX/PMD and those who did not. Mechanical ventilation parameters were within recommended limits for protective ventilation in both groups. Ninety-five percent of patients with PNX/PMD had the Macklin effect (linear collections of air contiguous to the bronchovascular sheaths) on a baseline computed tomography scan, and tended to have a higher lung involvement at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score 32.2  13.4 v 18.7  9.8 in patients without PNX/PMD, p = 0.08).

We evaluated five different point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kits against PCR, finding concordance across the assays (n = 15). We subsequently tested 200 patients using the OrientGene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and find a sensitivity of 74% in the early infection period (day 5-9 post symptom onset), with 100% sensitivity not seen until day 13, demonstrating inferiority to PCR testing in the infectious period. Negative rate was 96%, but in validating the serological tests uncovered potential false-negatives from PCR testing late-presenting cases.

Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death characterized by lipid-based reactive oxygen species accumulation. However, it is still unclear how miR-34c-3p influences the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by regulating ferroptosis. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of miR-34c-3p in OSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of miR-34c-3p in OSCC and matched normal tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, the effect of miR-34c-3p overexpression on cell proliferation and ferroptosis was evaluated using CCK8, colony formation assays, Live/Dead staining, Western blotting analysis, ROS, MDA, and GSH assay. RESULTS: The results showed lower expression of miR-34c-3p in OSSC compared with normal tissues. Overexpression of miR-34c-3p in SCC-25 cells suppressed cell proliferation. In addition, the overexpression of miR-34c-3p promoted ferroptosis by increasing ROS, MDA, and iron and decreasing GSH and GPX4 levels in SCC-25 cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed a novel strategy to upregulate erastin-induced ferroptosis in OSCC through the miR-34c-3p/SLC7A11 axis, suggesting new insights into OSCC and a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for OSCC.","output":"MiR-34c-3p upregulates erastin-induced ferroptosis to inhibit proliferation in oral squamous cell carcinomas by targeting SLC7A11"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments had to use the adoption of severe measures to counteract the spread of the infection.

Evolutionary analysis of data such as DNA sequences is highly important in biological studies. As alignment methods are ineffective for analyzing large-scale data due to their inherently high costs, alignment-free methods have recently attracted attention in the field of bioinformatics. In this paper, we introduce a new positional correlation natural vector (PCNV) method that involves converting a DNA sequence into an 18-dimensional numerical feature vector. Using frequency and position correlation to represent the nucleotide distribution, it is possible to obtain a PCNV for a DNA sequence. This new numerical vector design uses six suitable features to characterize the correlation among nucleotide positions in sequences. PCNV is also very easy to compute and can be used for rapid genome comparison. To test our novel method, we performed phylogenetic analysis with several viral and bacterial genome datasets with PCNV. For comparison, an alignment-based method, Bayesian inference, and two alignment-free methods, feature frequency profile and natural vector, were performed using the same datasets. We found that the PCNV technique is fast and accurate when used for phylogenetic analysis and classification of viruses and bacteria.","output":"Positional Correlation Natural Vector: A Novel Method for Genome Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 and appeared in the United States 1 month later.

Involving members of the public in research is becoming increasingly commonplace, in the UK and internationally. It is essential that public involvement is inclusive of individuals and their diverse life experiences, including challenging experiences that may be associated with stigma and social exclusion. The involvement of people with lived/living experience of substance use and homelessness in research is increasing in response to increased recognition of the importance of inclusion and the benefits conferred to research. MAIN BODY: In this commentary, we share our own experiences of being part of a Patient and Public Involvement group that was convened during a feasibility study of a peer-delivered harm reduction intervention. We are a diverse group but share experience of the field of substance use/homelessness, as people with lived/living experience, and as researchers and practitioners. We share our reflections and learning, as well as offer recommendations for researchers working in our field. Our group worked together to make a positive and deliberate contribution to the study. This did not happen by chance but required the development of mutual trust and respect, with each member having a commitment to support the group for its two-year duration. SHORT CONCLUSION: It is important for researchers to appreciate that meaningful Patient and Public Involvement is very valuable but requires a commitment from all involved. Regarding our field of substance use and homelessness specifically, it is essential that people with these experiences have opportunities to contribute to research and can do so in a meaningful way. People with lived/living experience are able to bring to life the rich tapestry of others experiences. However, the involvement must be neither tokenistic nor indifferent to the wider challenges common to these experiences.","output":"PPI?

We find that the US-China trade war poses more opportunities and risks than done-deal Brexit in the immediate term. Furthermore, thus far, the Taiwanese semiconductor industry appears to be a beneficiary of the US-China trade dispute, as Taiwans leading firms, notably TSMC, are pleasing the USA and China.

This study aims to identify the factors associated with scam susceptibility in older Black adults. METHODS Participants were 383 older Black adults living in the Chicago metropolitan area (mean age = 78 years and 82% female). A scam susceptibility measure assessed perceptions and behaviors that predispose older adults to fraud and scams. Categories of age-associated factors, including cognition, physical health, psychosocial factors, personality, and behavioral economics, were measured using uniform systematic assessments. For each category separately, measures associated with scam susceptibility were identified via stepwise variable selection. RESULTS Older age was associated with greater scam susceptibility. Further, the analysis revealed a robust association of cognitive health with scam susceptibility, particularly the domains of semantic and working memory. Psychological well-being was associated with susceptibility, as was neuroticism. Behavioral economic measures including financial and health literacy and financial and health decision-making ability were also implicated. In a final model that included all the measures initially retained by variable selection, semantic memory, psychological well-being, and financial and health literacy were independently associated with scam susceptibility. Moreover, the association of age was attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for these correlates. DISCUSSION Age-associated vulnerabilities, rather than age itself, predispose older Black adults to financial fraud and scams.

C57BL/6J mice were randomized to the following arms in two consecutive studies: sham-TBI [400 mg/kg, oral gavage (OG)], TBI/BM2.5 (400 mg/kg, OG), sham-TBI [200 mg/kg, subcutaneous (SC) injection], TBI/BM2.5 (200 mg/kg, SC), sham-TBI (100 mg/kg, SC), or nonirradiated [200 mg/kg, intramuscular (IM) injection]. The PK profile was also established in NHP exposed to TBI/BM5.0 (100 mg/kg, BID, OG). Genistein-aglycone serum concentrations were measured in all groups using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. The PK profile demonstrates 11% and 19% reductions in Cmax and AUC0-inf, respectively, among mice administered 400 mg/kg, OG, after TBI/BM2.5 compared to the sham-TBI control arm. Administration of 200 mg/kg SC in mice exposed to TBI/BM2.5 showed a 53% increase in AUC0-inf but a 28% reduction in Cmax compared to the sham-TBI mice. The relative bioavailability of the OG route compared to the SC and IM routes in mice was 9% and 7%, respectively. After the OG route, the dose-normalized AUC0-inf was 13.37 (ng.h/mL)/(mg/kg) in TBI/BM2.5 mice compared to 6.95 (ng.h/mL)/(mg/kg) in TBI/BM5.0 NHPs.

SS is considered to be an inflammatory and fibrotic disorder pathologically. However, there is no consensus on the most effective conservative treatment for fibrosis. Given that human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived extracellular vesicles (BMSC-EVs) displayed promising therapeutic effects for various tissues, we investigated the therapeutic effect of BMSC-EVs on fibrosis in a mice immobilization model and two cell models. By conducting a series of experiments, we found that BMSC-EVs can significantly inhibit the fibrogenic process both in vitro and in vivo. In detail, BMSC-EVs suppressed the aberrant proliferation, high collagen production capacity, and activation of fibrotic pathways in TGF--stimulated fibroblasts in vitro. Besides, in vivo, BMSC-EVs reduced cell infiltration, reduced fibrotic tissue in the shoulder capsule, and improved shoulder mobility. In addition, via exosomal small RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis, let-7a-5p was verified to be the highest expressed miRNA with predicted antifibrotic capability in BMSC-EVs. The antifibrotic capacity of BMSC-EVs was significantly impaired after the knockdown of let-7a-5p. Moreover, we discovered that the mRNA of TGFBR1 (the membrane receptor of transforming growth factor ) was the target of let-7a-5p.

Considering this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested reusing N95 respirators and recommended the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for sterilizing the respirators. However, only a few reports have described UVGI protocols for sterilizing the N95 respirators for reuse. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop and evaluate a novel method for the reuse of N95 respirators after sterilization by UVGI. Methods Before conducting the study, the function of N95 respirators after multiple UVGI with a total dose of up to 10 J (1 J/cm(2) or more per dose) was assessed by measuring the particle collection efficiency and ventilation resistance. The participants used N95 respirators during work if they passed the fit test. After use, the respirators were sterilized using UVGI (1 J/cm(2)) and stored in a breathable paper bag for a week. The procedure was repeated up to three times after confirming the successful results of the fit tests. Results The particle collection efficiency without UVGI was 96.7%, while those after one, five, and 10 cycles of UGVI were 96.8%, 97.2%, and 97.2%, respectively. Ventilation resistance without UVGI was 42 Pa, and 43 Pa, 42 Pa, and 41 Pa after one, five, and 10 cycles of UVGI, respectively, which satisfied the Japanese national certification standard DS2. All 43 participants passed the fit test before the first reuse, and 39 participants (90.7%) completed the entire study protocol. The results of this study showed that N95 respirators could be used safely after repeated UVGI treatment. Conclusions This study developed a novel method for reusing the N95 respirators.

In response to this global pandemic, this article summarizes proven strategies that could be employed to combat the COVID-19 disease outbreak, taking a cue from lessons learned from the Ebola virus disease response.","output":"Lutte contre la pandmie de maladie  coronavirus (Covid-19): tirer les le?ons de la rponse  la maladie du virus Ebola./ [Fighting the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic: Employing Lessons from the Ebola Virus Disease Response]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is clinically defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and the lack of membrane overexpression or gene amplification of receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2/HER2. Due to TNBC heterogeneity, clinical biomarkers and targeted therapies for this disease remain elusive. We demonstrated that ErbB-2 is localized in the nucleus (NErbB-2) of TNBC cells and primary tumors, from where it drives growth. We also discovered that TNBC expresses both wild-type ErbB-2 (WTErbB-2) and alternative ErbB-2 isoform c (ErbB-2c). Here, we revealed that the inhibitors of the retrograde transport Retro-2 and its cyclic derivative Retro-2.1 evict both WTErbB-2 and ErbB-2c from the nucleus of BC cells and tumors. Using BC cells from several molecular subtypes, as well as normal breast cells, we demonstrated that Retro-2 specifically blocks proliferation of BC cells expressing NErbB-2. Importantly, Retro-2 eviction of both ErbB-2 isoforms from the nucleus resulted in a striking growth abrogation in multiple TNBC preclinical models, including tumor explants and xenografts. Our mechanistic studies in TNBC cells revealed that Retro-2 induces a differential accumulation of WTErbB-2 at the early endosomes and the plasma membrane, and of ErbB-2c at the Golgi, shedding new light both on Retro-2 action on endogenous protein cargoes undergoing retrograde transport, and on the biology of ErbB-2 splicing variants. In addition, we revealed that the presence of a functional signal peptide and a nuclear export signal (NES), both located at the N-terminus of WTErbB-2, and absent in ErbB-2c, accounts for the differential subcellular distribution of ErbB-2 isoforms upon Retro-2 treatment. Our present discoveries provide evidence for the rational repurposing of Retro-2 as a novel therapeutic agent for TNBC.","output":"Halting ErbB-2 isoforms retrograde transport to the nucleus as a new theragnostic approach for triple-negative breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By modelling the evaporation and settling of droplets emitted during respiratory releases and using previous measurements of droplet size distributions and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, estimates of the evolution of the liquid mass and the number of viral copies suspended were performed as a function of time from the release.

Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent future consequences. The purpose of this Quality Improvement project was to optimize the institutions Epic Best Practice Advisory (BPA) screening tool and synthesize new patient questionnaires to diagnose MD in athletes greater than 12 years of age presenting to a pediatric sports medicine clinic. METHODS: Using Quality Improvement methodology, we evaluated clinic flow, the Epic BPA tool, and actions by the physician following the appropriate triggering of the BPA. Diagnoses targeted were primary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or irregular menstruation unspecified. Areas for intervention were global staff education, patient education, and provider alert fatigue. Our team implemented interventions using monthly Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to address our key drivers. Proper implementation of questionnaire data and restructuring of the Epic BPA promoted identification and diagnosis of MD. The clinician discussed the diagnosis with the patient and family and provided an educational handout on MD. RESULTS: The rate of appropriate diagnosis of MD in athletes greater than 12 years of age seen at a pediatric sports medicine clinic increased from a baseline of 2.1% to 30% over ten months. Identification of three key drivers ultimately drove the success and achievement of our aim. CONCLUSIONS: Using Quality Improvement methodology, we optimized the EPIC BPA and subsequently increased the rate of appropriate diagnosis of MD. Identification of the proper diagnosis improves our patient education.

Since this can be due to infusion of tumour cells contaminating the PBPC grafts, we initiated a feasibility study in which PBPC grafts from HD patients were purged by CD34(+) cell enrichment. Controversy exists about whether the use of CD34(+) enriched stem cells leads to a delayed haematological and immune reconstitution. We compared these parameters, including risk of infections and clinical outcome after HDT, in patients with HD given either selected CD34(+) cells or unmanipulated PBPC as stem cell support. From October 1994 to May 2000, 40 HD patients with primary refractory disease or relapse were treated with HDT and supported with either selected CD34(+) cells (n = 21) or unmanipulated PBPC (n = 19) as stem cell support. All patients had chemosensitive disease at the time of transplantation. A median of 5.8 (range 2.7C20.0) vs 4.5 (range 2.3C17.6)  10(6) CD34(+) cells per kilo were reinfused in the CD34(+) group and PBPC group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups with regard to time to haematological engraftment, reconstitution of B cells, CD56(+) cells and T cells at 3 and 12 months and infectious episodes after HDT. Two (5%) treatment-related deaths, one in each group, were observed.

Delays to treatment are particularly prevalent when patients require a transfer from hospitals without EVT capability onsite. A novel computer aided triage system, Viz LVO, has the potential to streamline workflows. This platform includes an image viewer, communication system, and an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that automatically identifies suspected LVO strokes on CTA imaging and rapidly triggers alerts. We hypothesize that the Viz application will decrease timeto- treatment. Methods: A prospective database was assessed for patients who presented to a stroke center utilizing Viz LVO in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York and underwent EVT following transfer for LVO stroke between July 2018 and March 2020. This time period was chosen due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting stroke workflow after March 2020. Time intervals were compared for 55 patients divided into Pre- and Post-Viz cohorts. Results: The median initial door-to-neuroendovascular team (NT) notification time interval was significantly faster (25.0 minutes [IQR=12.0] vs 40.0 minutes [IQR=61.0];p=0.01) with significantly less variation (p&lt;0.05). The median initial door-to-skin puncture time interval was 25 minutes shorter in the Post-Viz cohort, although not statistically significant (p=0.15). Post Viz LVO implementation, the Viz notification was the first NT notification 38% (10/26) of the time. Conclusions: Our preliminary results have shown that Viz LVO implementation is associated with earlier, more consistent NT notification times and potentially treatment times. This platform presents a novel application of AI that can serve as an early warning system and a failsafe to ensure that no LVO is left behind.

A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media-Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961-8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736-1.952).

However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs).

As the duration of summer break in the prior four seasons of LaLiga (from 2015-2016 to 2018-2019) was of similar length to the suspension of the championship due to COVID-19 (~12 weeks), we have analysed the running performance of teams competing in LaLiga in these four seasons to anticipate players physical performance after the resumption of the competition. The analysis includes the average running distance per game for each of the 38 matchdays that compose LaLiga. One-way ANOVA revealed that there was a main effect of the matchday on total running distance per match (p = 0.001), and in the distance covered between 14.0 and 20.9 km/h (p < 0.001), between 21.0 and 23.9 km/h (p < 0.001) and at above 24.0 km/h (p < 0.001). Overall, the post-hoc analysis revealed that the running patterns progressively increased during the first 8-10 matchdays and then reached a plateau which was significantly different to matchday-1 (p < 0.05). This analysis reveals that, in the prior four competitive seasons of LaLiga, players physical performance was lower at the beginning of the season and the teams needed approximately 8-10 matchdays to reach a steady state running performance.

In this process, following translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) and termination at the stop codon, a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF, which is typically in close proximity. Consistent with this, the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF (UAA) in the pentanucleotide UAA UG. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we confirm that MNV VP2 expression is regulated by termination-reinitiation and define the mRNA sequence requirements. Efficient reintiation is dependent upon 43 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG site. Chemical and enzymatic probing revealed that the RNA in this region is not highly structured and includes an essential stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 (Motif 1). The relative position of Motif 1 with respect to the UAA UG site impacts upon the efficiency of the process. Termination-reinitiation in MNV was also found to be relatively insensitive to the initiation inhibitor edeine. CONCLUSIONS: The termination-reinitiation signal of MNV most closely resembles that of influenza BM2. Similar to other viruses that use this strategy, base-pairing between mRNA and rRNA is likely to play a role in tethering the 40S subunit to the mRNA following termination at the VP1 stop codon. Our data also indicate that accurate recognition of the VP2 ORF AUG is not a pre-requisite for efficient reinitiation of translation in this system.","output":"Expression of the VP2 Protein of Murine Norovirus by a Translation Termination-Reinitiation Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is likely to be androgen mediated"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is fast becoming a key intervention against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic We conducted cross-sectional online surveys to investigate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across nine Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs;N = 10,183), assuming vaccine effectiveness at 90% and 95% The prevalence of vaccine acceptance increased from 76 4% (90% effectiveness) to 88 8% (95% effectiveness) Considering a 90% effective vaccine, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and five African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Uganda, Malawi, and Mali) had lower acceptance odds compared to Brazil Individuals who perceived taking the vaccine as important to protect themselves had the highest acceptance odds (aOR 2 49) at 95% effectiveness Vaccine acceptance was also positively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, worry/fear regarding COVID-19, higher income, younger age, and testing negative for COVID-19 However, chronic disease and female gender reduced the odds for vaccine acceptance The main reasons underpinning vaccine refusal were fear of side effects (41 2%) and lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness (15 1%) Further research is needed to identify country-specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy in order to develop mitigation strategies that would ensure high and equitable vaccination coverage across LMICs","output":"Factors Affecting COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: An International Survey among Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human (h) carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) function depends upon IgV-mediated homodimerization or heterodimerization with host ligands, including hCEACAM5 and hTIM-3, and a variety of microbial pathogens.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as the most common mental illness after an epidemic, must be seriously addressed. This study aimed to investigate the subjective fear of the Chinese general public during COVID-19 and to explore how it affected the development of PTSD. Methods: An online questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,009 people from January 30 to February 14, 2020 (about 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak). The subjective fear was measured by a self-reported single-choice question. Four items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure the subjects' sleep quality. Their post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Pearson correlation, hierarchical multivariate regression analysis, multiple mediator model, and bootstrapping were used in statistical analyses. Results: Different people showed different levels of subjective fear in response to the outbreak. There was a significant positive correlation between subjective fear and the total score of PCL-5 (R = 0.513, P < 0.01), meaning that the higher the degree of subjective fear, the more severe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress are. Subjective fear was an important predictor of PTSS, accounting for 24.3% of the variance. The total effect of subjective fear on PCL-5 scores was significant (total effect = 7.426, SE = 0.405, 95% CI = 6.631C8.221).

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), offer infinite resources for newly synthesized human islets. Recent advancements in hPSCs technology have enabled direct differentiation to human islet-like clusters, which can sense glucose and secrete insulin, and those islet clusters can ameliorate diabetes when transplanted into rodents or non-human primates (NHPs). However, the generated hPSC-derived human islet-like clusters are functionally immature compared with primary human islets. There remains a challenge to establish a technology to create fully functional human islets in vitro, which are functionally and transcriptionally indistinguishable from cadaveric human islets. Understanding the complex differentiation and maturation pathway is necessary to generate fully functional human islets for a tremendous supply of high-quality human islets with less batch-to-batch difference for millions of patients. In this review, I summarized the current progress in the generation of 3D-structured human islets from pluripotent stem cells and discussed the importance of adapting physiology for in vitro functional human islet organogenesis and possible improvements with environmental cues.","output":"Adapting Physiology in Functional Human Islet Organogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From 22 March until 18 May 2020, a complete lockdown in Italy was ordered as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study presents, for the first time, laboratory data on the use of alcohol and drugs in a high-risk population during Italys first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty subjects with SUDs were monitored for the use of illicit drugs and alcohol every 3 months before, during and after the lockdown, by hair analysis. The number of samples positive for heroin, cocaine, MDMA and cannabis fell considerably during the lockdown and then resumed to pre-lockdown levels when the period of confinement was over. Interestingly, the consumption of benzodiazepines and alcohol followed the opposite trend; both the number of benzodiazepine-positive samples and the level of alcohol consumption increased and remained high, even at the end of the lockdown. The confinement measures produced significant changes in drug/alcohol use patterns, with a shift toward the use of substances that were more easily accessible, used as self-medication for negative feelings, and used to alleviate the effects of abstinence from drugs that were no longer readily available.","output":"Changes in Drug Use Patterns during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Monitoring a Vulnerable Group by Hair Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine development.","output":"Vaccination with single plasmid DNA encoding IL-12 and antigens of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus elicits complete protection in IFNAR knockout mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The confluence (sangam) of India's two major rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, is located in the city of Allahabad. Ritualistic dips in these river waters are revered for their believed curative power against infections, and salvation from the karmic cycles of birth and rebirth. The sacred and geographic propensities of the rivers have mythic valences in Hinduism and other religious traditions. Yet the connection of these river waters with curativeness also has a base in historical microbiology: near here, the British bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin, in 1896, first described the 'bactericidal action of the waters of the Jamuna and Ganges rivers on Cholera microbes', predating the discovery of bacterial viruses (now known as bacteriophages) by at least two decades. Pursuing the record of these purificatory waters in sacred writings and folklore, and later elaboration in the work of Hankin, this paper traces an epistemology of time that connects the mythic to the post-Hankin modern scientific, asking how imaginations of the waters' antibacterial properties are articulated through idioms of faith, filth and the phage. The paper explores how the bacteriophage virus comes to be spoken about within secular and sacred epistemes of infection and riverine pollution, among contemporary historians, biologists and doctors, and in the city's museums. At the same time, it traces the phage in histories arcing from the ancient religious literature, to colonial disease control efforts, to today, where bacteriophages are being conceived as a potential response to the crisis of planetary antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Allahabad presents a 'cosmotechnics' where faith, filth and phage are inextricably intertwined, generating complex triangulations between natural ecologies, cultural practices and scientific imaginations. Cosmotechnics therefore opens up novel avenues to reimagine the phage as a protean object, one that occupies partial and multiple spaces in the historico-mytho-scientific arena of Allahabad today.","output":"The virus in the rivers: histories and antibiotic afterlives of the bacteriophage at the sangam in Allahabad."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Persistent somatic symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, have been referred to as somatization. Somatization is commonly associated with histories of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although previous research has demonstrated that PTSD can predict somatic problems, there has been no examination of this at the level of PTSD symptom clusters and multidimensional assessment of somatic symptoms. We examined the association between the three International Classification of Disease (11th Edition) PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing in the here and now, avoidance, and sense of threat), measured in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic as the stressor, and somatic symptoms while statistically adjusting for confounding variables. METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1041 adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland. Physical health problems across the domains of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the International Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sense of threat was associated with the presence of pain (? = 0.254), fatigue (? = 0.332), gastrointestinal (? = 0.234), and cardiovascular symptoms (? = 0.239). Avoidance was associated with pain (? = 0.347). Reexperiencing was not associated with any physical health variable. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of COVID-19, the sense of threat symptoms in PTSD is most strongly related to somatic problems.

The Self-efficacy in Palliative Care Scale (SEPC) is considered a valid and reliable assessment scale to evaluate confidence when delivering palliative care. Currently, there is not a reliable instrument aimed to measure healthcare professionals confidence in palliative care in Swedish. Therefore, this study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the SEPC-scale for use in a Swedish healthcare context. METHODS: This study applied the World Health Organizations (WHO) guidelines for translating and adapting instruments, using forward and back-translation, an expert panel, and cognitive interviews. Swedish experts in palliative care (n = 6) assessed the Swedish version of the SEPC-scale based on its relevance, understandability, clarity, and sensitivity on a Likert scale. Methods involved calculation of content validity index (CVI) with modified kappa statistics and cognitive interviewing with healthcare professionals (n = 10) according to the think-aloud method. RESULTS: Calculation of I-CVI (Item-CVI) showed that the Swedish SEPC-scale was considered relevant but needed some modifications to improve its understandability and clarity. The experts recognized an absence of precision in some items that affected clarity and understanding. Likewise, the healthcare professionals highlighted some challenges with understandability and clarity. They indicated that the scale was relevant, but a few items needed adjustment to fit a broader range of healthcare professionals. Items that referred to death and dying could be sensitive but were considered relevant.

We hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses, hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected 35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and their association with various disease outcomes.","output":"Ontology-based systematic classification and analysis of coronaviruses, hosts, and host-coronavirus interactions towards deep understanding of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for detecting Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done between July 2019 and January 2020 involving parents of all students aged 2C5 years, attending 2 kindergarten schools in Thiruvalla using a self-administered questionnaire. Parents also used the Werner David Development pictorial scale (WDDPS), a screening tool to report cognitive development. The schools were sampled based on convenience. RESULTS: Of the 189 children included in the study, 89.4% had excess screen use (> 1 h per day) and the average use was 2.14 h. 45.0% of parents supervised screen use inconsistently (self-reported). Meal-time screen use (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3C10.8), receiving screen on demand (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2C11.3), and using devices other than computers (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.6C26.8) were significantly associated with excess screen use in pre-school children.

To address this socio-ecological problem, Shiga Prefectural Government implemented a public program to remove overgrown weeds and compost them ashore to conserve the lake environment, while coastal inhabitants and occasional volunteers remove weeds from the beaches to maintain the quality of the living environment. However, these effects are limited because of disjointed social networks. We applied an adaptive and abductive approach to develop community capability to jointly address this problem by sharing academic knowledge with local actors and empowering them. The initial multifaceted reviews, including interviews and postal questionnaire surveys, revealed that the agro-economic value of composted weeds declined in historical and socio-psychological contexts and that most of the unengaged public relied on local governments to address environmental problems. These findings were synthesized and assessed with workshop participants, including local inhabitants, governmental agents, businesspeople, social entrepreneurs, and research experts, to unearth the best solution.

METHODOLOGY: Our study retrospectively investigated three groups of patients: the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Restrictions' when the restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection; the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Normalization' when normalization attempts were made and the restrictions were lifted; and the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' exactly 1 year before the normalization period, which would reflect the normal functioning of the emergency service at that time. The three groups were compared with respect to the demographic characteristics and patient outcomes (death/hospitalization/discharge). RESULTS: A total of 69,474 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' whereas 21,278 patientswere admitted in the 'Period of Restrictions'. The number of emergency service admissions in the 'Period of Restrictions' was significantly lower (p<0.01).

However, tack fixation poses the risk of adhesions and injury to the intestine. We report the case of spiral tacks adherent to the small bowel after IPOM repair for incisional hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE 64 years old male patient who underwent laparoscopic IPOM repair for incisional hernia 1 year after open sigmoid resection. A laminated polypropylene mesh was fixed with titanium spiral tacks. 4 years later, elective open cholecystectomy was performed. Two spiral tacks integrated in the seromusular layer of the small bowel were encountered. Tacks were removed and bowel lesions oversewn with interrupted seromuscular stitches. DISCUSSION According to the current literature, complications related to metal spiral tacks in IPOM mesh repair such as intestinal perforation or strangulation ileus seem to be rare. To our knowledge, spiral tacks adherent to the intestine have not yet been published to date. Alternative techniques for mesh fixation are transfascial sutures with single stitches, continuous sutures or fibrin glue, as already used in TAPP and TEP procedures for inguinal hernia repair. The ideal and safest technique for mesh fixation in IPOM repair for incisional hernias remains controversial. CONCLUSION Spiral tacks used for intraperitoneal mesh fixation can lead to adhesions and bowel lesions. Sutures, absorbable tacks or fibrin glue are alternatives for mesh fixation. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safest technique of laparoscopic IPOM incisional hernia repair.","output":"Small bowel lesion due to spiral tacks after laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair for incisional hernia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic contact dermatitis is a condition seen in individuals when sensitized to an allergen through skin then exposure to the sensitized substance or cross-reacting to it (1).

The aim of this article was to describe our experience with the rollout and use of a virtual pretransplantation evaluation platform to facilitate ongoing transplant waitlisting during the early peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis of the process improvement project implemented to continue the evaluation of potential kidney transplantation candidates and ensure waitlist placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational metrics include transplantation volume per month, referral volume per month, pretransplantation patients halted before completing an evaluation per month, evaluations completed per month, and patients waitlisted per month. RESULTS: Between April and September 2020, a total of 1,258 patients completed an evaluation. Two hundred and forty-seven patients were halted during this time period before completing a full evaluation. One hundred and fifty-two patients were presented at selection and 113 were placed on the waitlist. In addition, the number of patients in the active referral phase was able to be reduced by 46%. More evaluations were completed within the virtual platform (n = 930 vs n = 880), yielding similar additions to the waitlist in 2020 (n = 282) vs 2019 (n = 308) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The virtual platform allowed continued maintenance of a large kidney transplantation program despite the inability to have in-person visits. The value of this platform will likely transform our approach to the pretransplantation process and provides an additional valuable method to improve patient equity and access to transplantation.","output":"Maintaining Equity and Access: Successful Implementation of a Virtual Kidney Transplantation Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid distribution of viral\\\\induced diseases and weaknesses of common diagnostic platforms for accurate and sensitive identification of infected people raises an urgent demand for the design and fabrication of biosensors capable of early detection of viral biomarkers with high specificity.

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Internet addiction (IA) prevalence and analyzed the correlated factors during quarantine and pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was generated, comprising of a sociodemographic section, Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), Symptoms Checklist-90, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The hyperlink was disseminated through social media, companies, and universities. Overall, 4,734 adults, (mean age 31.84  7.73 years old and 55.2% males) representing all 34 provinces of Indonesia, gave valid responses. RESULTS: Point prevalence of IA during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.4% in Indonesian adults. Online duration increased by 52% compared to before the pandemic. Physical distancing was not established as a risk of IA. Increased daily online duration, specific motivations, types of application, and having confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household were predictive of IA. All subscales of SCL-90 and PSQI were higher in the group with positive/suspect cases of COVID-19 within households and were correlated to higher scores of IA. DISCUSSION: Physical distancing alone was not associated with an increased risk of IA. The prevalence of IA during COVID-19 was higher than the previously proposed rate among Indonesian adults, which might be related to digital activities associated with COVID-19 and the popularity of virtual socializing. Furthermore, psychopathologies and sleep disruptions were related to IA occurrences and especially prevalent in groups with proximity to COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 contraction and rampant misinformation of COVID-19 probably contributed to these factors, which potentially harbor long-term consequences. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated a high point prevalence of IA and identified several preventable factors predictive of IA during home-quarantine and COVID-19, especially in adults with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household. However, physical distancing did not increase the odds of IA. Public health agencies should maintain physical distancing advisory while providing adaptive psychiatric education and service.","output":"The Impact of Physical Distancing and Associated Factors Towards Internet Addiction Among Adults in Indonesia During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Web-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A critical component of the worldwide response to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has been providing the general public with information about the virus and the health measures designed to slow its spread Much of this information has been presented as visual graphics Have people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) been able to gain access to this information through nonvisual media and, if so, how?

There are limited data on participant demographic characteristics in vaccine trials despite the importance of these data to current trials aimed at preventing coronavirus disease 2019. Objective: To investigate whether racial/ethnic minority groups and female and older adults are underrepresented among participants in vaccine clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study examined data from completed US-based vaccine trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2020. The terms vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and inoculation were used to identify trials. Only those addressing vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy of preventative vaccines were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The numbers and percentages of racial/ethnic minority, female, and older individuals compared with US census data from 2011 and 2018. Secondary outcome measures were inclusion by trial phase and year of completion. Results: A total of 230 US-based trials with 219a?555 participants were included in the study. Most trials were randomized (180 [78.3%]), included viral vaccinations (159 [69.1%]), and represented all trial phases. Every trial reported age and sex; 134 (58.3%) reported race and 79 (34.3%) reported ethnicity. Overall, among adult study participants, White individuals were overrepresented (77.9%; 95% CI, 77.4%-78.4%), and Black or African American individuals (10.6%; 95% CI, 10.2%-11.0%) and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-0.5%) were underrepresented compared with US census data; enrollment of Asian individuals was similar (5.7%; 95% CI, 5.5%-6.0%). Enrollment of Hispanic or Latino individuals (11.6%; 95% CI, 11.1%-12.0%) was also low even among the limited number of adult trials reporting ethnicity. Adult trials were composed of more female participants (75a?325 [56.0%]), but among those reporting age as a percentage, enrollment of participants who were aged 65 years or older was low (12.1%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.3%). Black or African American participants (10.1%; 95% CI, 9.7%-10.6%) and Hispanic or Latino participants (22.5%; 95% CI, 21.6%-23.4%) were also underrepresented in pediatric trials. Among trials reporting race/ethnicity, 65 (48.5%) did not include American Indian or Alaska Native participants and 81 (60.4%) did not include Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that among US-based vaccine clinical trials, members of racial/ethnic minority groups and older adults were underrepresented, whereas female adults were overrepresented. These findings suggest that diversity enrollment targets should be included for all vaccine trials targeting epidemiologically important infections.","output":"Assessment of the Inclusion of Racial/Ethnic Minority, Female, and Older Individuals in Vaccine Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES. To investigate socioeconomic and ethnic group inequalities in prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the 27 federative units of Brazil. METHODS. In this cross-sectional study, three household surveys were carried out on May 14-21, June 4-7, and June 21-24, 2020 in 133 Brazilian urban areas. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 250 individuals in each city to undergo a rapid antibody test. Subjects answered a questionnaire on household assets, schooling and self-reported skin color/ethnicity using the standard Brazilian classification in five categories: white, black, brown, Asian or indigenous. Principal component analyses of assets was used to classify socioeconomic position into five wealth quintiles. Poisson regression was used for the analyses. RESULTS. 25 025 subjects were tested in the first, 31 165 in the second, and 33 207 in the third wave of the survey, with prevalence of positive results equal to 1.4%, 2.4%, and 2.9% respectively. Individuals in the poorest quintile were 2.16 times (95% confidence interval 1.86; 2.51) more likely to test positive than those in the wealthiest quintile, and those with 12 or more years of schooling had lower prevalence than subjects with less education. Indigenous individuals had 4.71 (3.65; 6.08) times higher prevalence than whites, as did those with black or brown skin color. Adjustment for region of the country reduced the prevalence ratios according to wealth, education and ethnicity, but results remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS.

Most frontline healthcare professionals have never witnessed anything like this before. As a result, staff may experience numerous and continuous traumatic events, which in many instances, will negatively affect their psychological well-being. Particularly, nurses face extraordinary challenges in response to shifting protocols, triage, shortages of resources, and the astonishing numbers of patients who require care in expedited time constraints. As most healthcare workers are passionate nursing professionals, frustration and often a sense of powerlessness occur when they find themselves unable to provide needed care to their patients. The overwhelming number of deaths, patients isolated and dying alone, and the ever-present fear of being infected and then infecting colleagues, family, friends due to the lack of protective gear or known protocols takes its toll on emotional and psychological well-being. For nurses, the experience of this significant (hopefully once-in-a-lifetime) event can inflict on-going moral injury. Nurses affected by this trauma require education, coping tools, and therapy to help avoid or alleviate the adverse effects on their well-being.

Advances in preventing and responding to sexual harassment contribute to highlighting the intervention as being crucial to supporting survivors against retaliation. A lack of support provides a general explanation on why bystanders tend not to intervene and highlights the reality that reprisals are suffered by those who support victims. METHODS: From the existing knowledge about sexual harassment prevention and response mechanisms, this paper analyzes scientific evidence through a review of the literature published in databases, as well as legislation, reports, and other materials. RESULTS: The context that enables SOV legislation is grounded in three realms: (1) bystander intervention and protection, (2) the role of support networks in protecting survivors, and (3) awareness and legislation of SOSH. An active bystander refers to the involvement of someone who is aware of potential sexual harassment situations. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of legislation against SOSH limits bystander intervention and support; therefore, legislating protection for supporters has become urgent and necessary. Legislating SOSH has great social implications because gender equality cannot be fully achieved if bystander protection is not legally considered. Policy Implications: As no legal system has previously contemplated SOSH, its pioneering parliamentarian approval and establishment by Catalan law constitute a legal key innovation for the field of gender and womens studies. In fact, evidence reported here are important in developing further regulations and policy.

However, few have focused on the specific needs of Asian Americans (AA). We examine the prevalence of HRSN during a period spanning the COVID-19 pandemic to inform strategies to improve cancer screening and primary care among AA patients. Methods: We implemented a self-administered HRSN screening tool in English and Chinese, traditional (T) or simplified (S) text, within a hospital-affiliated, outpatient primary care practice predominantly serving AA in New Jersey. HRSN items included food insecurity, transportation barriers, utility needs, interpersonal violence, housing instability, immigration history, and neighborhood perceptions on cohesion and trust. We conducted medical chart reviews for a subset of participants to explore the relationship between HRSN and history of cancer screening. Results: Among 236 participants, most were Asian (74%), non-US born (79%), and privately insured (57%). One-third responded in Chinese (37%). Half reported having 1 HRSN. Interpersonal violence was high across all participants. Transportation needs were highest among Chinese-T participants, while food insecurity and housing instability were higher among Chinese-S participants. Lower-income patients had higher odds of having 2 HRSN (OR:2.53, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.98). Older age and public insurance/uninsured were significantly associated with low neighborhood perceptions. Conclusions: We observed higher than anticipated reports of HRSN among primary care patients in a suburban, hospital-affiliated practice serving AA. Low neighborhood perceptions, particularly among Chinese-S participants, highlight the importance of addressing broader SDOH among insured, suburban AA patients. These study findings inform the need to augment HRSN identification to adequately address social needs that impact health outcomes and life course experiences for Asian patients. As HRSN measuring efforts continue, and COVID-19's impact on the health of minority communities emerge, it will be critical to develop community-specific referral pathways to connect AA to resources for HRSN and continue to address more upstream social determinants of health for those who are disproportionately impacted.","output":"Health Related Social Needs Among Chinese American Primary Care Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Cancer Screening and Primary Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Whereas data from the pre-pandemic era have demonstrated that tracheostomy can accelerate liberation from the ventilator, reduce need for sedation, and facilitate rehabilitation, concerns for healthcare worker safety have led to disagreement on tracheostomy placement in COVID-19 patients. Data on COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy may inform best practices. Thus, we report a retrospective institutional cohort experience with tracheostomy in ventilated patients with COVID-19, examining associations between time to tracheostomy and duration of mechanical ventilation in relation to patient characteristics, clinical course, and survival. Methods Clinical data were extracted for all COVID-19 tracheostomies performed at a quaternary referral center from April-July 2020. Outcomes studied included mortality, adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to decannulation. Results Among 64 COVID-19 tracheostomies (13% of COVID-19 hospitalizations), patients were 64% male and 42% African American, with a median age of 54 (range, 20-89). Median time to tracheostomy was 22 (range, 7-60) days and median duration of mechanical ventilation was 39.4 (range, 20-113) days. Earlier tracheostomy was associated with shortened mechanical ventilation (R2=0.4, P<0.01). Median decannulation time was 35.3 (range, 7-79) days. There was 19% mortality and adverse events in 45%, mostly from bleeding in therapeutically anticoagulated patients. Conclusions Tracheostomy was associated with swifter liberation from the ventilator and acceptable safety for physicians in this series of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The goal of this study was to investigate individual- and household-level predictors of food and water stockpiling (FWS) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic among Non-Latino Black and Latino adults. This study was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Participants were 2,174 Non-Latino Black (66.4%) and Latino (33.6%) adults residing in a Midwestern state, who completed the survey in either May or June/July 2020. Participants were asked to self-report (yes or no) if they stockpiled food and/or water in the prior 7 days in response to the pandemic. A variety of variables was examined, including education level, annual income, employment status, concerns about COVID-19, and self-quarantine status. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were used to identify variables associated with FWS. Non-Latino Black participants had lower odds of reporting FWS compared to Latinos (OR 0.64;95% CI, 0.51-0.79). Similarly, participants who were not concerned about COVID-19 had lower odds of FWS compared with those extremely concerned (OR 0.37;95% CI, 0.20 C 0.71). In contrast, odds of FWS were higher among participants who were self-quarantining all the time compared to those who were not (OR 2.16;95% CI, 1.31 C 3.59). Results showed that Latinos, adults concerned about COVID-19, and self-quarantine status had significantly higher odds of FWS during the pandemic. None.

The study took place in Israel during the last week of the first COVID-19 lockdown, when citizens were restricted to remain within 100 m of home. A survey company distributed questionnaires among 776 individuals. The questionnaires included demographic variables (gender, ethnic and cultural groups, age, income loss due to the pandemic), contact with nature variables (Nature near home, Nature viewed from home windows, and being in nature on the preceding day), and well-being measures (positive affect, negative affect, vitality, happiness, and stress). Before completing the well-being questionnaire, participants took part in an experiment that tested the effect of viewing nature images or urban images on well-being measures. The results showed that nature near home and nature viewed from the windows contributed to higher levels of well-being, and that being in nature on the preceding day was associated with higher levels of positive affect. These benefits emerged even among those who had been economically harmed by the pandemic. Viewing nature images was also associated with level of well-being, mainly to reduced level of stress and negative affect. The current findings extend the understanding of the benefits of access to nature during stressful times, particularly during emergencies when accessing remote nature is impossible. Furthermore, the findings highlight the dual effect of contact with nature on well-being: enhancement of positive affect together with reduction of negative affect and stress. The findings indicate that exposure to nature is much more valuable for women than for men. These findings are highly important in view of gender differences in pandemic's impact on people's well-being. Graphical abstract Image 1","output":"See or Be?

This situation can generate sudden illness and work accidents where the need to have knowledge in emergency first response (EFR) is necessary for all. Unfortunately, workshops and courses to certify EFR individuals are usually taught only to healthcare professionals. Therefore, to address this need a EFR project has been developed at the Tecnolgico de Monterrey (TEC) which consists of a multidisciplinary challenge to train, certify, and evaluate students competency as emergency first responders in medical emergencies and healthcare awareness. This EFR project has been performed for one week, every year since 2015, and constitutes a joint venture among academic departments, faculty, and industrial/government institutions, which work together in multidisciplinary projects, providing a source of innovative proposals. The EFR project at TEC has provided instruction and certification for 966 students between 2015 to 2019 and this study has analyzed results considering a sample size of 197 participants. The combination of exam evaluation, medical emergency skills verification, and project proposal results indicate that most students reach skill levels between 2 and 3 in EFR competency after successfully completing the program, regardless of their year of study or the undergraduate program they are enrolled on.

Methods After obtaining IRB approval, we conducted telephone surveys of HTR (n=30) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate their experience with acute COVID-19 illness and assess symptoms of Long COVID-19. Symptoms at onset and also beyond 6, 12, and 24 weeks of the initial diagnosis were recorded. Additionally, medical charts were reviewed for detailed information regarding transplant history, immunosuppression, COVID-19 management and hospitalization, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results As noted in Table 1, among the 30 participants, 10 (33%) had symptoms consistent with Long COVID-19. Those with Long COVID-19 were more symptomatic during acute illness, with 40% of patients reporting cough, fevers or chills, and headaches, compared with 15%, 25%, and 20% respectively in those without Long COVID-19. Emergency department visits at initial illness (80% vs. 20%) and admission to the intensive care unit were more frequent (60% vs. 5%) in the Long COVID-19. Symptoms of Long COVID-19 lasted for a median of 9 weeks with 30% reporting ongoing symptoms at week 24. The most common persistent symptoms were depression, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Conclusion This study is an early investigation of a complex syndrome of Long COVID-19 in transplant patients. Long COVID-19 is not well described in the transplant setting. HTR at our center with Long COVID-19 were sicker at their initial COVID-19 diagnosis and had more emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and longer hospital stays than those without subsequent Long COVID-19. Although, recall bias could affect participants ability to remember details and symptoms, this would have impacted both groups similarly as the time since COVID-19 diagnosis to study enrollment was similar between the two groups.

The initial diagnostic of COVID-19 is based on the test of Sputum, Blood and SWAB of throat and nose. The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours but shortened to minimum of 45 hr.

Among the first promising repurposing agents proposed for treatment and prophylaxis, 2 antimalarial agents came into limelight: chloroquine and its less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Intense research and public debates have followed. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY As HCQ is still used and studied, future research may bring novel evidence, modifying the state-of-the-art. Despite the lack of a single randomized control trial (RCT) with positive results, there are currently (as for the search on 30th of August 2020) more than 250 RCT registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with HCQ in COVID patients, and more than 150 of them are \\"still recruiting\\" or \\"not yet recruiting\\" patients. DATA SOURCES Our study combines a therapeutic evaluation of RCT data with a sociological analysis of related controversies, examining scientific and public arena discourses. RESULTS Although any hope of a positive effect was brought exclusively by some and not all of the observational studies, none of the 7 RCT published until now have found any benefit. From a sociological perspective, the HCQ controversy is a useful case study for understanding the construction of plausibility in a cultural context polarized into competing versions of reality, with different epistemologies and ideologies. CONCLUSIONS The results of the first RCTs have been published, and they are disappointing; beneficial effects of HCQ could not be proven either for negative conversion on polymerase chain reactions of COVID patients or for postexposure prophylaxis. The question to be asked is: how many studies do we need until HCQ is abandoned? Argumentative time work, appealing to temporal properties of HCQ including its historical use, accumulation of evidence, alternative therapeutic scenarios, and sensationalist tempo for rhetorical purpose, plays a significant role in its continuing legitimation.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19: Lack of Efficacy and the Social Construction of Plausibility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins are made of atoms constantly fluctuating, but can occasionally undergo large-scale changes. Such transitions are of biological interest, linking the structure of a protein to its function with a cell. Atomic-level simulations, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD), are used to study these events. However, molecular dynamics simulations produce time series with multiple observables, while changes often only affect a few of them. Therefore, detecting conformational changes has proven to be challenging for most change-point detection algorithms. In this work, we focus on the identification of such events given many noisy observables. In particular, we show that the No-prior-Knowledge Exponential Weighted Moving Average (NEWMA) algorithm can be used along optical hardware to successfully identify these changes in real-time. Our method does not need to distinguish between the background of a protein and the protein itself. For larger simulations, it is faster than using traditional silicon hardware and has a lower memory footprint. This technique may enhance the sampling of the conformational space of molecules.

DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: ICUs at a large academic medical center in the United States. SUBJECTS: Adult, critically ill patients admitted to ICU, with 27 patients admitted for acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 37 patients admitted for diagnoses other than coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Review of electronic health record. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Many U.S. states released crisis standards of care guidelines with algorithms to allocate scarce healthcare resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We compared state guidelines that represent different approaches to incorporating disease severity and comorbidities: New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. Following each algorithm, we calculated priority scores at the time of ICU admission for a cohort of patients with primary diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 and diseases other than coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 64). We assessed discrimination of 28-day mortality by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We simulated real-time decision-making by applying the triage algorithms to groups of two, five, or 10 patients. For prediction of 28-day mortality by priority scores, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.56, 0.49, 0.53, 0.66, and 0.69 for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. For groups of five patients, the percentage of decisions made without deferring to a lottery were 1%, 57%, 80%, 88%, and 95% for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. The percentage of decisions made without lottery was higher in the subcohort without coronavirus disease 2019, compared with the subcohort with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of comorbidities does not consistently improve an algorithms performance in predicting 28-day mortality. Crisis standards of care algorithms result in a substantial percentage of tied priority scores. Crisis standards of care algorithms operate differently in cohorts with and without coronavirus disease 2019.

However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework and contrast how content features differ with sociocultural background in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms. METHODS: We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications. RESULTS: There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues.

Furthermore, inflammatory markers and N-terminal-proB-type-natriuretic peptide were higher in COVID-19-positive AMI patients. Only 20.0% (17) of COVID-19-positive patients underwent coronary angiography. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in AMI patients with concomitant COVID-19-positive status (27.9%) than in patients without COVID-19 during the same period (3.7%; p < 0.001). Patients with AMI and COVID-19 tended to be older, with more co-morbidities, when compared to those with an AMI and without COVID-19. In conclusion, myocardial infarction with concomitant COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Efforts should be focused on the early recognition, evaluation, and treatment of these patients.","output":"Comparison of Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction With Versus Without Coronarvirus-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Rapid intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is crucial for improving outcomes. However, randomized trials to reduce in-hospital delay are clearly limited in China. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a multi-component intervention on thrombolytic door-to needle time (DNT) of AIS patients via video teleconference based on the Behavior Change Wheel method. Methods: This trial randomly allocated 22 hospitals equally to PEITEM (Persuasion Environment reconstruction Incentivisation Training Education Modeling) intervention or routine care plus stroke registry and subsequently enrolled 1634 AIS patients who receiving IVT within 4.5 hours upon stroke onset from participant hospitals. The PEITEM group received a one-year PEITEM intervention based on the behavioral theory monthly via video teleconference. Results: A total of 1, 634 patients from the 22 hospitals were enrolled. The proportion of DNT  60 minutes was 82.0% in the PEITEM group and 73.7% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42 to 2.42, P<0.001). The average DNT was 43 minutes in the PEITEM group and 50 minutes in the control group (: -9.00;95% CI, -11.37 to 6.63, P<0.001). Favorable neurological outcomes were achieved in 55.6% patients in the PEITEM group and 50.4% patients in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34;95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75;P=0.04). Conclusions: The teleconference-delivered PEITEM intervention resulted in a moderately but clinically relevant shorter DNT and better neurological outcomes in the AIS treated with the IVT.

We found that the pristine ZnO nanosheet weakly interacts with the HCHO with adsorption energy (Ead) of -9.3 kcal/mol, and the sensing response (S) value of 2.2 at 623 K. After the Al-doping process, the Ead and S values increase to -40.7 kcal/mol and 83.9, respectively, indicating an excellent agreement with the experimental results. We showed a relation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the S value, confirming with the experimental results. Also, the proposed Al-doped ZnO nanosheet shows a good selectivity to HCHO gas at the presence of H2, NH3, C2H5OH, CO, and CH4 gases. A short recovery time of 18 s is predicted for Al-ZnO-based sensor which is comparable with the experimental value of 26 s.

The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it may take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and after development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma therapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight COVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19 infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and will result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions (complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread until the vaccine development.

However, the application of these models needs to solve complicated differential equations, enabling use of these models only by professional researchers. In this study, a simple, SIR-like but individual-based model, the l-i AIR model, is presented.

The nth terms of the three variables are derived, which can be easily calculated in Microsoft Excel, making the program easy to be used in most offices. A transmission coefficient k and a transient incidence rate of the infected people are induced in the model to examine the effect of social distancing and the testing capacity of coronavirus on the epidemic curves.

METHODS: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey in France from March 17 to May 11, 2020. Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a PWD living at home (HC) and 159 accompanying a PWD living in a nursing home (NHC) participated in the study.

RESULTS: Half of the caregivers exhibited PMH, including depression, anxiety, or self-reported stress. Similar PMH rates were provided whatever the PWD place of residence. Regarding HC, our results also highlighted a number of risk factors for PMH, including the fact that caregiver live with PWD, to give increased support to PWD, and to feel more isolated for managing PWD since lockdown. CONCLUSION: PMH was observed for caregivers of PWD during lockdown, whatever PWD living place, suggesting that concern for PWD may explain more of caregiver distress than increased material tasks.

One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. OBJECTIVE: From statistical perspectives, we identify several key issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. METHODS: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) to analyze the reconstructed data. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We use the restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) as a global and robust measure for efficacy. RESULTS: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups at day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in the recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles.

Conclusions Viral lysis buffer maintains the integrity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for up to 48 hours even at room temperature and supports delayed diagnosis with an overwhelming sample load in testing laboratories.","output":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Viral Lysis Buffer Stored at Different Temperatures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we argue that the design and timing of regulatory responses, as well as the adherence of the population to the relevant rules, have a critical impact on the progression and public health consequences of the pandemic. This hypothesis is empirically tested using the example of Poland, a country which experienced, compared to its Western European neighbours, relatively mild first phase of the pandemic. In this context, we compare Poland with selected Western European countries, including France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and supplement them by examples from other Visegrad Four (V4) countries C Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary. On that basis, we conclude that while the observed differences between the countries in the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic are the result of a multitude of complex and interrelated reasons (such as demographic structure, population density and connectivity or cultural factors), well-designed public health measures, which are implemented early as a part of the proactive strategy that anticipates and reacts quickly to changing circumstances can effectively decrease number of COVID-19 infections and related deaths, provided that adherence of a relevant population is high.","output":"Do Regulations Matter in Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic?

The most common symptoms of a disease are fever, cough, generalized body ache, weakness, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Among vascular complications of COVID-19, the venous thrombotic complications, like pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep veins thrombosis, are not uncommon. But data about arterial thrombotic complications of COVID-19, especially carotid thrombosis, are still limited. We are describing a case of stroke due to thrombosis of the right carotid arteries, in a patient who had recovered from asymptomatic COVID-19. A 66-year-old male with arterial hypertension presented to the emergency department with a history of repeated collapse, dysarthria, weakness in the left extremities, and a drop in the left angle of his mouth (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]-4). The patient was swabbed for COVID-19 which was negative. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was obtained which showed thrombosis in the branching point of the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT) continuing into the right subclavian artery (SA) and also into the right common carotid artery (CCA), with a subtotal occlusion of the right CCA, extending into the internal carotid artery (ICA) as well. From the apical lung tissue caught during the CT scan, bilateral, irregular widespread ground-glass opacifications, as well as consolidations and small reticular changes were seen in the lungs, which is typical for COVID-19 infection. A quantitative antibody test for COVID-19 infection was performed with the results showing a strong positivity for IgG antibodies, indicating previous COVID-19 infection. The patient was indicated for a standard carotid thrombectomy, which was performed without complications. It seems that one of the important factors that led to the formation of the thrombus in the carotid arteries was COVID-19 infection-induced inflammation in the atherosclerotic carotid vessels and generalized hypercoagulability as well as hyperviscosity. COVID-19 infection is an independent and important risk factor for the formation of an arterial thrombus during the acute illness and in the early post-COVID-19 period also, regardless of the severity of its course.

METHODS A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.","output":"Motives and considerations regarding PGT in couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality: a qualitative exploration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Hospital policies forbidding or limiting families from visiting relatives on the intensive care unit (ICU) has affected patients, families, healthcare professionals, and patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). We sought to refine evidence-informed consensus statements to guide the creation of ICU visitation policies during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics and to identify barriers and facilitators to their implementation and sustained uptake in Canadian ICUs. METHODS: We created consensus statements from 36 evidence-informed experiences (i.e., impacts on patients, families, healthcare professionals, and PFCC) and 63 evidence-informed strategies (i.e., ways to improve restricted visitation) identified during a modified Delphi process (described elsewhere). Over two half-day virtual meetings on 7 and 8 April 2021, 45 stakeholders (patients, families, researchers, clinicians, decision-makers) discussed and refined these consensus statements. Through qualitative descriptive content analysis, we evaluated the following points for 99 consensus statements: 1) their importance for improving restricted visitation policies; 2) suggested modifications to make them more applicable; and 3) facilitators and barriers to implementing these statements when creating ICU visitation policies. RESULTS: Through discussion, participants identified three areas for improvement: 1) clarity, 2) accessibility, and 3) feasibility. Stakeholders identified several implementation facilitators (clear, flexible, succinct, and prioritized statements available in multiple modes), barriers (perceived lack of flexibility, lack of partnership between government and hospital, change fatigue), and ways to measure and monitor their use (e.g., family satisfaction, qualitative interviews). CONCLUSIONS: Existing guidance on policies that disallowed or restricted visitation in intensive care units were confusing, hard to operationalize, and often lacked supporting evidence. Prioritized, succinct, and clear consensus statements allowing for local adaptability are necessary to guide the creation of ICU visitation policies and to optimize PFCC.

Design/methodology/approach: A primary research was conducted through a structured questionnaire. A field study was conducted in two malls that attract the maximum crowd. The data from 250 respondents were analysed in total. Findings: As per the present study, the combination of playing music with fragrance is more effective compared to playing music or fragrance alone on shopping behaviour, footfalls and repeat visits in retail stores in emerging markets like India. Research limitations/implications: The study is more confined to a comparative study of the effectiveness of music with or without fragrance on consumer purchase behaviour and footfalls in retail stores located in malls. In view of research design, this could be a limitation of the study as types of music and other ambiance factors are not considered. The present study can be extended to religion as the religiosity of respondents may give a different response. The urban respondents may vary when compared to rural consumers. Therefore, the study can be extended by adding the rural or A-city mall or smaller malls in big cities. Research can be extended in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era to see if there is a change in consumer behaviour. It can also be extended to consumer's preference for different music and different fragrances. Practical implications: This paper provides marketing managers and retail owners with valuable insights on the importance of using music with fragrance in retail stores to create unique consumer experiences in emerging markets that are different from developed countries. Managers should try to create both music, and fragrance in the store to improve purchase intention, and stay longer. To ensure that the planned music and fragrance approach creates the ambiance for consumers, marketing managers are advised to conduct market research. Special care should be taken for younger visitors to the store by creating the right ambiance. The present research will help many offline retailers' managers to strive for new competitive advantages through creating favourable shopping environments by understanding cultural differences. Originality/value: The research gives direction to use music with a fragrance in the retail ambiance in the malls which will lead to improved consumer purchase, more footfalls, repeat visits and staying longer in emerging markets like India, which is a destination for global brands. Integration of three models of impulse buying (Rook and Fisher, 1995), individualism and collectivism (Triandis, 1995) and stimulusCorganismCresponse (SCOCR) model of Mehrabian and Russell (1974) is used to explain the complex behaviour of consumers towards more purchases and repeat visits.

To date, there have been no reported cases of A. phagocytophilum infection found in both the biting tick and the patient following a tick bite. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman presented with fever following a tick bite, with the tick still intact on her body. The patient was diagnosed with HGA. The tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by morphological and molecular biological detection methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The patients blood was cultured after inoculation into the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. A. phagocytophilum growth was confirmed via culture and isolation. A. phagocytophilum was identified in both the tick and the patients blood by Anaplasma-specific groEL- and ankA-based nested polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. Moreover, a four-fold elevation in antibodies was observed in the patients blood. CONCLUSION: We report a case of a patient diagnosed with HGA following admission for fever due to a tick bite.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the level of exposure and risk of COVID-19 virus infection among HCWs in COVID-19 treatment centers in Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was utilized in this study and HCWs were invited by convenience to participate in the study, 408 HCWs in 4 COVID-19 treatment centers participated in the study. Adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were used to categorized HCWs as low or high risk of COVID-19 virus infection. The WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool was used to collect quantitative data from the study participants. RESULTS: There was a high (N = 328, 80.4%) level of occupational exposure to the COVID-19 virus. However, only 14.0% of the exposed HCWs were at high risk of COVID-19 virus infection. Healthcare workers who performed or were present during any aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) were 23.8 times more likely to be exposed compared to HCWs who did not perform or were absent during any AGP (AOR 23.83; 95% CI: 18.45, 39.20).

Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health interventions, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. OBJECTIVE: Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists' skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. METHODS: This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&R. The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations' Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. RESULTS: Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies. The proposed PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&R.","output":"Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR): a proposed framework for expanding pharmacy professionals' roles and contributions to emergency preparedness and response during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El COVID-19, enfermedad producida por el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, se ha expandido rpidamente alrededor del mundo, convirtindose en una pandemia.

Therefore, coping strategies (CSs) are vital for mental well-being. Widespread research studies have explored this domain, targeting caregivers, nurses, physicians and medical teachers, but limited research has been done to explore the common CSs utilised by medical students at the undergraduate medical education level. Therefore, we aimed to identify the frequently occurring CSs and their effects on mental health disorders (MHDs) through the evidence available in the existing literature. METHODS: For this scoping review, we searched the available literature (articles published from January 1, 1986, to March 31, 2021) on CSs at Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus using the terms coping, medical students and undergraduate medical education. We included in our search all peer-reviewed journal articles whose central topics were the CSs employed by undergraduate medical students of any age, nationality, race and gender. RESULTS: From among the 2,134 articles that were found, 24 were ultimately included in the study. The articles were authored in 14 countries, allowing us to gather broader data to answer our research question. The first identified theme (MHDs) had four subthemes: stress (55% of the articles), depression (30%), anxiety (25%) and burnout (15%). The second theme (CSs), on the other hand, had eight subthemes: support seeking (60%), active coping (40%), acceptance (40%), avoidance/denial (40%), substance abuse (35%), faith/religion (25%), sports (25%) and miscellaneous (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Themes and subthemes were identified about the most common CSs utilised by undergraduate medical students to tackle common MHDs in the context of medical education. Among the most used CSs was support (social and emotional) seeking. Teaching medical students how to cope with challenging times is essential.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics, prognostic biomarkers and in-hospital outcomes of patients with a history of HF hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS A total of 8321 consecutive patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19 disease were screened. Furthermore, 3849 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Two hundred and forty COVID-19 patients with a history of HF and 240 without HF paired with PSM were evaluated. RESULTS Mean age was 72.7  9.90 years, and 64.6% were men. Oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at admission were significantly lower and heart rate was significantly higher in patients with a history of HF compared to those without. Patients with HF, compared to those without, had significantly higher leukocyte count, D-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin, hsTnI, lactate and lower albumin and lymphocyte. Compared with patients without HF, those with previous HF had a longer length of stay at ICU (6.22 d vs. 3.71 d; p < 0.001), increased risk of mechanical ventilation (42.1% vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001), in-hospital death (39.2% vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001) and composite outcomes (52.9% vs. 17.1%; p < 0.001).

We hypothesized autoantibodies against angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor expressed on vascular endothelium, are generated during COVID-19 and are of mechanistic importance. METHODS: In an opportunity sample of 118 COVID-19 inpatients, autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 were detected by ELISA. Binding properties of anti-ACE2 IgM were analyzed via biolayer interferometry. Effects of anti-ACE2 IgM on complement activation and endothelial function were demonstrated in a tissue-engineered pulmonary microvessel model. RESULTS: Anti-ACE2 IgM (not IgG) autoantibodies were associated with severe COVID-19 and found in 18/66 (27.2%) patients with severe disease compared with 2/52 (3.8%) of patients with moderate disease (OR 9.38, 95% CI 2.38C42.0; P = 0.0009). Anti-ACE2 IgM autoantibodies were rare (2/50) in non-COVID-19 ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Unexpectedly, ACE2-reactive IgM autoantibodies in COVID-19 did not undergo class-switching to IgG and had apparent K(D) values of 5.6C21.7 nM, indicating they are T cell independent. Anti-ACE2 IgMs activated complement and initiated complement-binding and functional changes in endothelial cells in microvessels, suggesting they contribute to the angiocentric pathology of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We identify anti-ACE2 IgM as a mechanism-based biomarker strongly associated with severe clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has therapeutic implications.

This study compared two training methods for donning and doffing PPE in order to teach health care workers how to do so more effectively and quickly. Method A total of 48 health care workers were recruited and randomly divided into two groups. Group A watched a 10-minute demonstration (demo) video repeated four times, while Group B watched the same demo video twice followed by a 10-minute live demo twice. The learning time of both groups was the same, and an examination was performed immediately after the completion of training. The examination scores of Group A and Group B were recorded according to the checklist (Appendix 1). The time taken for the participants to don and doff PPE, their satisfaction with the training, and the confidence to don and doff PPE were analyzed. Results The average score of Group B was better than that of Group A, with a mean (SD) of 94.92 (1.72) vs. 86.63 (6.34), respectively (P < 0.001).

Regular monitoring with ctDNA has the potential to detect and treat cancer relapse earlier, but there is little evidence on patient acceptability. This study examines the views of patients with early-stage melanoma on the acceptability of the test and early treatment. METHODS: A qualitative cross-sectional design using one-to-one semi-structured telephone interviews was employed. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma (Stage IACIIC) were asked for their views on ctDNA monitoring and early treatment for relapse. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two themes were generated: ctDNA monitoring would add service value where participants described regular ctDNA monitoring in follow-up care as more reassuring, more scientific than skin checks and preferable to scans. Test results provide opportunity and knowledge focuses on how participants wanted to know when to expect results to manage anxiety, with a positive result seen as an opportunity to receive treatment early. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were positive about ctDNA monitoring and early treatment and would welcome extra surveillance, as well as trust ctDNA tests.

Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with relatively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.

This experience underscored the need for a standardized privacy and safety tool as HB-TMH is expected to continue as a resource during future crises as well as to become a component of the routine mental health care landscape. Methods: The authors represent a subset of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Telemental Health Consortium. They met weekly through videoconferencing to review published safety standards of care, existing TMH guidelines for clinic-based and home-based services, and their own institutional protocols. They agreed on three domains foundational to the delivery of HB-TMH: environmental safety, clinical safety, and disposition planning. Through multiple iterations, they agreed upon a final Privacy and Safety Protocol for HB-TMH. The protocol was then operationalized into the Privacy and Safety Assessment Tool (PSA Tool) based on two keystone medical safety constructs: the World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist/Time-Out and the Checklist Manifesto. Results: The PSA Tool comprised four modules: (1) Screening for Safety for HB-TMH; (2) Assessment for Safety During the HB-TMH Initial Visit; (3) End of the Initial Visit and Disposition Planning; and (4) the TMH Time-Out and Reassessment during subsequent visits. A sample workflow guides implementation. Conclusions: The Privacy and Safety Protocol and PSA Tool aim to prepare providers for the private and safe delivery of HB-TMH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on KAPs regarding COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis. Knowledge and practice scores were calculated and categorized based on the number of correct responses. Predictors of knowledge and practice scores were identified by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In all, 347 HCPs participated. Most participants had an average knowledge score and suboptimal practice score. Independent predictors of getting an average knowledge score were being indirectly involved in laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio, OR: 2.591; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.106C6.070), and having a government website as a major source of information (OR: 6.184; 95% CI: 1.185C32.286).

In this paper, we examine the extent to which the Coronavirus pandemic influenced Malawi's 2020 elections. We consider how fear of infection and economic distress affected citizens' trust and confidence in President Mutharika's government, their willingness to turn out to vote, and their choices at the polls using data collected pre- and post-Covid. We find that fears about the virus and its economic impact did influence trust and confidence in the government to handle Covid but had little to no effect on either abstention or vote choice.

We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk.","output":"A global analysis on the effect of temperature, socio-economic and environmental factors on the spread and mortality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the research community has had a real-world look at reasons for improving vaccine responses to emerging RNA viruses.

(1) Start with a platform based on live viruses that infect bacteria, but not humans (bacteriophages, or phages). (2) Isolate phages (to be called pathogen homologs) that resemble and provide antigenic context for membrane-covered, pathogenic RNA viruses; coronavirus-phage homologs will probably be found if the search is correctly done. (3) Upon isolating a viral pathogen, evolve its phage homolog to bind antibodies neutralizing for the viral pathogen.

Previous BFR studies have reported positive treatment effects; however, clinical benefits to using BFR following meniscal repair or chondral surgery are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of resistance exercises with BFR training versus exercises alone on self-reported knee function, thigh circumference, and knee flexor/extensor strength postmeniscal or cartilage surgery. DESIGN: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial in an outpatient military hospital setting. Twenty participants were randomized into 2 groups: BFR group (n = 11) and control group (n = 9). METHODS: Participants completed 12 weeks of postoperative thigh strengthening. The BFR group performed each exercise with the addition of BFR. Both groups continued with the prescribed exercises without BFR from 12 weeks until discharged from therapy. Thigh circumference and self-reported knee function were measured at 1, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively along with knee extensor and flexor strength at 12 and 24 weeks. Change scores between time points were calculated for knee function. Limb symmetry indices (LSI) were computed for thigh circumference and knee strength variables. RESULTS: Seventeen participants were included in the final analyses (BFR = 8 and control = 9) due to COVID-19 restrictions. There were no interactions or main effects for group. Time main effects were established for change in knee function scores, thigh circumference LSI, and knee extensor strength LSI. However, knee flexor strength LSI had no main effect for time. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this trial suggest that resistance exercises with and without BFR training may result in similar changes to function, thigh atrophy, and knee extensor strength postmeniscus repair/chondral restoration, though further study with larger sample sizes is needed.","output":"The Effect of Blood Flow Restriction Training on Muscle Atrophy Following Meniscal Repair or Chondral Restoration Surgery in Active Duty Military: A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The importance of hypoxia inducible factor-1  (HIF-1) stabilization in uncontrolled infection and inflammation is widely accepted. Several inhibitors of HIF signalling are in clinical trials for malignancy, ischemia and inflammatory diseases. Increased hypoxia is being reported to be an important modifier for several pathological features of COVID-19 such as impaired immunity, hyper-inflammation, thrombosis, lung injury and sepsis. Methods: : In this study we tested the effect of whole aqueous extract Adhatoda Vasica (AV), that our group has shown to have anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects, on various outcomes of hypoxic response. Effects of AV were assessed in preclinical mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, bacterial sepsis and siRNA induced hypoxia-thrombosis phenotype. Therapeutic relevance of AV in current pandemic were also examined through transcriptome and molecular docking analysis. Results: : Oral administration AV extract attenuated the increased levels of airway inflammation, collagen content, transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), IL-6, HIF-1 and improved the overall survival rate in bleomycin treated and Cecum Ligation and Puncture (CLP) induced mice. AV treatment also rescued the prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 ( phd 2 ) siRNA induced HIF-1 and associated blood coagulation phenotypes in mice. Transcriptome analysis of lungs of AV treated na?ve mice reveal downregulation of hypoxia, inflammation, TGF-1 and angiogenesis and upregulation of adaptive immunity related genes. These genes and pathways show opposite expression in transcriptome of BALF and PBMCs of SARS-CoV2 infected patient.

METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in the emergency department of Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University. A total of 171 patients (male/female: 68 [39.8%]/103 [60.3%]) with AP and 59 age and gender matched healthy subjects (male/female: 23 [39%]/36[61%]) as controls were enrolled in the present study. The patients were grouped according to severity and adverse outcomes according to BISAP and mGPS and a comparative analysis was performed to compare the NLR, PLR, and RDW between groups. RESULTS: The mean NLR values of AP patients and control group were 9.626.34 and 2.041.08, respectively (p<0.001), while the mean PLR values of AP patients and control group were 221.83122.43 and 83.3038.89, respectively (p<0.001).

The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. METHODS: 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. RESULTS: The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (&#8804; 3 vs > 3).

As mobile devices are ubiquitous nowadays, the collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) is gaining momentum. So far, data are lacking on the modalities that contribute to the quantity and quality of ePROs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the utilization of two versions of a subsequently employed mobile app for electronic monitoring of PROs and to test our hypothesis that a shared review of symptoms in patient-physician collaboration has an impact on the number of data entries. METHODS: The Consilium Care app engages cancer patients to standardize reporting of well-being and treatment-related symptoms in outpatient settings. For descriptive comparison of the utilization of two slightly different app versions, data were obtained from an early breast cancer trial (version 1 of the app, n=86) and an ongoing study including patients with advanced disease (version 2 of the app, n=106). In both app versions, patients and doctors were allowed to share the information from data entries during consultations. Version 2 of the app, however, randomly selected symptoms that required a detailed and shared regular patient-doctor review in order to focus on the collection and appropriate interpretation regarding awareness and guidance for severity grading. The numbers and types of symptom entries, satisfaction with both app versions, and patients perceived effects during consultations were included for analysis. RESULTS: Symptom severity grading was performed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) using a horizontal slider and was indicated in descriptive terminology in both apps, while a graphical display facilitated the illustration of symptom history charts. In total, 192 patients electronically reported 11,437 data entries on well-being and 33,380 data entries on individual symptoms. Overall, 628 (of 872 intended) requested patient-doctor symptom reviews were performed in version 2 of the app. Both the amount of data entries per patient and day for well-being (version 1 vs version 2: 0.3 vs 1.0; P<.001) and symptoms (version 1 vs version 2: 1.3 vs 1.9; P=.04) appeared significantly increased in version 2 of the app. Overall satisfaction with both app versions was high, although version 2 of the app was perceived to be more helpful in general.

METHODS: We identified subjects admitted for Covid-19 in whom a large panel of immunological markers were measured, including B- and T- and NK-lymphocyte phenotypes, T-lymphocyte subpopulation cells and plasma cytokines. Patients were divided according to symptom severity during hospitalisation, in those with uncomplicated and complicated infection. Differences between groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included (mean age: 83 years; 9 women; mean delay of symptoms onset: 4 days). Six had uncomplicated infection, while 11 developed complicated forms during hospitalization. CD10 + B lymphocyte levels were inversely correlated with clinical severity (5.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.04) and CD10+ levels above 3% were independently associated with uncomplicated forms [Odds Ratio 0.04 (CI 0.002-0.795, p = 0.034)].

However, the etiology of the illness remains obscure. It appears highly likely that the neurodegenerative processes involve an array of elements that influence each other. In addition, genetic, endogenous, or exogenous toxins need to be considered as viable partners to the cellular degeneration. There is compelling evidence that indicate the key involvement of modified -synuclein (Lewy bodies) at the very core of the pathogenesis of the disease. The accumulation of misfolded -synuclein may be a consequence of some genetic defect or/and a failure of the protein clearance system. Importantly, -synuclein pathology appears to be a common denominator for many cellular deleterious events such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dopamine synaptic dysregulation, iron dyshomeostasis, and neuroinflammation. These factors probably employ a common apoptotic/or autophagic route in the final stages to execute cell death. The misfolded -synuclein inclusions skillfully trigger or navigate these processes and thus amplify the dopamine neuron fatalities. Although the process of neuroinflammation may represent a secondary event, nevertheless, it executes a fundamental role in neurodegeneration. Some viral infections produce parkinsonism and exhibit similar characteristic neuropathological changes such as a modest brain dopamine deficit and -synuclein pathology. Thus, viral infections may heighten the risk of developing PD. Alternatively, -synuclein pathology may induce a dysfunctional immune system. Thus, sporadic Parkinsons disease is caused by multifactorial trigger factors and metabolic disturbances, which need to be considered for the development of potential drugs in the disorder.","output":"The Nigral Coup in Parkinsons Disease by -Synuclein and Its Associated Rebels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Location probability learningthe acquisition of an attentional bias toward locations that frequently contained a search targetshows many characteristics of a search habit.

On each trial of a visual search task, participants first saccaded toward a unique C-shape, whose orientation determined whether participants should continue searching for a T target among L distractors. The C-shape often appeared in one, C-rich quadrant that differed from where the T was frequently located. Experiment 1 showed that participants acquired LPL toward the high-probability, T-rich quadrant, an effect that persisted in an unbiased testing phase. Participants were also faster finding the target in the vicinity of the C-shape, but this effect did not persist after the C-shape was removed.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to investigate parameters and risk stratification tools that can be applied to predict mortality within 90 days of hospital admission in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search of original studies assessing systems and parameters predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19 was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE. RESULTS: 589 titles were screened, and 76 studies were found investigating the prognostic ability of 16 existing scoring systems (area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC) range: 0.550C0.966), 38 newly developed COVID-19-specific prognostic systems (AUROC range: 0.6400C0.9940), 15 artificial intelligence (AI) models (AUROC range: 0.840C0.955) and 16 studies on novel blood parameters and imaging. DISCUSSION: Current scoring systems generally underestimate mortality, with the highest AUROC values found for APACHE II and the lowest for SMART-COP. Systems featuring heavier weighting on respiratory parameters were more predictive than those assessing other systems. Cardiac biomarkers and CT chest scans were the most commonly studied novel parameters and were independently associated with mortality, suggesting potential for implementation into model development. All types of AI modelling systems showed high abilities to predict mortality, although none had notably higher AUROC values than COVID-19-specific prediction models. All models were found to have bias, including lack of prospective studies, small sample sizes, single-centre data collection and lack of external validation. CONCLUSION: The single parameters established within this review would be useful to look at in future prognostic models in terms of the predictive capacity their combined effect may harness.","output":"Evaluating risk stratification scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"A Rare Finding of Upper Limb Deep Venous Thrombosis in a Patient with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the number of workplace measures implemented to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic reported by employees and their association with company size and industry among employees in Japan Methods: A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was conducted of full-time employees in Japan from March 19C22, 2020 Questions were about announcements by the company of measures taken and 23 items of workplace measures Associations of company size and industry with the announcements and the number of workplace measures were analyzed Results: The final sample consisted of 1,379 respondents The mean number of implemented preventive measures for COVID-19 among 23 items was 11 2 (standard deviation, 5 9) Proportions of respondents who reported receiving announcement of measures taken was high (79 9%), as were proportions of respondents reporting implementation of some of the workplace measures, while the less than half reported implementation of most of the workplace measures The announcement of measures and the number of workplace measures that were implemented in the workplace were generally lower/smaller among respondents in smaller companies and in retail, wholesale, and transportation industries Conclusions: While most respondents reported receiving information about measures by their companies/organizations, it may be a further challenge to implement workplace measures in smaller companies and companies in retail, wholesale, and transportation industries","output":"Workplace responses to COVID-19 and their association with company size and industry in an early stage of the epidemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we explore how the law has perpetuated the medicalisation of childbirth, and outline why this may limit the ability of birthing persons to access and opt for homebirth.

This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. METHODS: All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. RESULTS: In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer treated in our hospital between January 2017 and March 2019 were retrospectively included. The three nutritional assessment methods were assessed, and multivariable analysis was conducted to explore predictive factors for clinical prognoses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) were generated to evaluate the discriminative abilities of the three nutritional assessment tools. RESULTS: A total of 442 patients were recruited. Multivariable analysis revealed that the PNI value predicted 1-year death and 1-year recurrence and that both the NRS 2002 score and the PNI value predicted 30-day readmission (P < 0.05). For PNI, AUROCs were 0.834 for predicting 1-year death and 0.719 for 1-year recurrence prediction; for NRS, the AUROC was 0.820 2002 for predicting 30-day readmission. The optimal cutoff values that maximized the prognostic prediction ability were PNI values of 47.75 g/L and 50.40 g/L for 1-year death and 1-year recurrence, respectively, and an NRS 2002 score of 3 points for 30-day readmission following discharge.

They caused a large number of casualties and a wider psychological crisis, which might cause severe consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide. AIMS: To reveal the law of formation of public psychological crisis in public health emergencies, and draw lessons from it. To provide ideas for effectively deal with these psychological crisis problems and fundamentally curbing the occurrence of public health emergencies. METHOD: Through the method of literature research, 'public health incidents', 'psychological crisis', 'mental health', 'psychological intervention', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'MERS', 'EVD', and 'COVID-19' were used to search literatures in the databases such as PubMed, Springer, and Sciencedirect, and the literatures were summarized, sorted, and studied. RESULTS: (1) The public health emergencies caused a universal psychological crisis. The main manifestations were depression, compulsion, despair, etc. The people involved mainly include patients, suspected isolated patients, medical staff, and the general public in the epidemic situation. (2) People's psychological state often experienced stress stage, shock stage, acceptance, and reorganization. Only some susceptible individuals couldn't complete effective psychological reconstruction, resulting in serious psychological disorders. Individual susceptibility is related to genetic factors, adversity, and traumatic stimuli experienced in early life. CONCLUSION: To reduce these psychological crisis problems, we should establish and improve the psychological crisis intervention or rescue system of public health emergencies, it was still necessary to live in harmony with nature, get rid of the inappropriate habit of preying on wild animals, in order to prevent the cross-species transmission of the virus between wild animals and humans, and to fundamentally avoid the occurrence of major infectious diseases.","output":"The influence and enlightenment of five public health emergencies on public psychology since new century: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is important for uncovering the viral and host factors that contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 or irradiated, inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. Genomic RNA from the animals inoculated with the irradiated virus was found to be highly stable, whereas subgenomic RNA, an indicator of viral replication, was found to degrade quickly. We combined this information with single-cell RNA sequencing of cells isolated from the lung and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes and developed new analysis methods for unbiased targeting of important cells in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through detection of reads to the viral genome, we were able to determine that replication of the virus in the lungs appeared to occur mainly in pneumocytes, whereas macrophages drove the inflammatory response. Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the lungs, rather than tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, were most likely to be responsible for phagocytosis of infected cells and cellular debris early in infection, with their roles switching during clearance of infection. Together, our dataset provides a detailed view of the dynamics of virus replication and host responses over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.","output":"Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in lungs of African green monkeys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing opportunities for students to exercise their creative skills in large, entry engineering classes challenges most faculty.

The paper presents a study done in two different semesters, comparing the students using Mechanix to a control (problem on paper). To ease grading, the control group's trusses were analyzed by Mechanix after submission. No mean homework grade differences were observed, but students in the Mechanix group produced trusses that could withstand higher loads. This is despite the fact the only guidance or feedback Mechanix provides was if the students' calculated max load was correct, and if it was not, which member failed. This study occurred in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. Students also submitted more attempts in Mechanix than the control. It may be students in the control group only submitted correct answers despite being asked to submit all attempts. Future work will provide more incentive for students to submit all attempts on paper. Mechanix automatically records all attempts. During high stress (Covid-19), more students in the Mechanix group submitted the assignment indicating that students may find this system less mentally taxing to use, less stressful, or something else led to this difference. It will be explored with focus groups in the future.

Design and setting: Throughout Spain, 45 hospitals took part in the universal screening of pregnant women going into labour using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID 19 since late March 2020. Methods: The cohort of exposed and unexposed pregnancies was followed up until 6 weeks postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of COVID 19 exposure, compared to non exposure, with infection related obstetric outcomes. Main outcome measures: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Results: In the cohort of 1,009 screened pregnancies, 246 were COVID 19 positive.

There is also a long-standing and concurrent rise in the prevalence and severity of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, the intersection between these two conditions needs to be carefully considered to ensure a more effective delivery of healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Generally, those with SUDs are more likely to have higher risk social determinants of health factors. Therefore, these patients are more likely to have barriers that can create difficulties in following appropriate infection control measures which in turn increases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2. In addition, these individuals have higher rates of medical comorbidities which increases the risk of all adverse outcomes, including mortality, from SARS-CoV2 infection. SUMMARY: Individuals with SUDs are at increased risk of both contracting SARS-CoV2 infection and suffering from worse outcomes afterwards. Though these risks of adverse outcomes are specific of SARS-CoV2 infection, the risk of exposure to other infectious diseases is increased in this population too. Healthcare providers and policymakers should then consider how to better protect this at-risk population and alleviate this increased disease burden.","output":"The effects of substance use on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection risks and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"THE ISSUE: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives.

Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional, nationwide, multicenter study, adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (n = 454) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (n = 4721), who were under follow-up for at least a year in the outpatient clinics, were consecutively enrolled. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters of patients were recorded. Vaccination histories were documented according to the self-statements of the patients. RESULTS: Patients with T1DM and T2DM had similar vaccination rates for influenza (23.6% vs 21.2%; P = 0.240) and pneumococcus (8% vs 7%; P = 0.451) vaccinations. Longer diabetes duration and older age were the common independent associates of having vaccination for both types of diabetes patients. Higher education level, using statin treatment, and having optimal hemoglobin A1c levels were the common independent associates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in patients with T2DM. CONCLUSION: TEMD Vaccination Study shows that patients with T1DM and T2DM had very low influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in Turkey.

Severe forms of acute respiratory failure can develop. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may affect organs other than the lung, such as the liver, with frequent onset of late cholestasis. We here report the histological findings of a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication of acute ischemic and gangrenous cholecystitis with a perforated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian male, affected by acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the severity of the disease, invasive mechanical ventilation was instituted and SARS-CoV-2 treatment (azithromycin 250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg trice-daily) started. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was also administered subcutaneously. At day 8 of ICU admission, the clinical condition improved and patient was extubated. At day 32, patient revealed abdominal pain without signs of peritonism at examination, with increased inflammatory and cholestasis indexes at blood tests. At a first abdominal CT scan, perihepatic effusion and a relaxed gallbladder with dense content were detected. The surgeon decided to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The day after, conditions further worsened and a laparotomic cholecystectomy was performed. A relaxed and perforated ischemic gangrenous gallbladder, with a local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was intraoperatively met. The gallbladder and a sample of omentum, adherent to the gallbladder, were also sent for histological examination. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides display inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal obliteration of vessels, with wall breakthrough, hemorrhagic infarction, and nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder. The mucosa of the gallbladder appears also atrophic. Omentum vessels also appear largely thrombosed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti-CD31), while not in micro-vessels, with a remarkable activity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lymphocytes (anti-CD4) against gallbladder vessels. All these findings define a histological diagnosis of vasculitis of the gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis can be a tardive complication of COVID-19, and it is characterized by a dysregulated host inflammatory response and thrombosis of medium-size vessels.","output":"Histopathological findings in a COVID-19 patient affected by ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compliance with public health measures, such as restrictions on movement and socialization, is paramount in limiting the spread of diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (also referred to as COVID-19).

In particular, we focus on the number of people sharing YouTube videos on Twitter before and during COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed by 109 countries. We find that the media sharing behavior differs widely between countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations.

We hypothesize that there is a higher incidence and an increased risk of mortality among Covid-19 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Methods: This retrospective study included 2,711 patients ages 18 years or older who tested positive for Covid-19 between March 2020 through March 2021 at a public hospital in New York City. GIB was documented based on clinical criteria and a decrease in hemoglobin level. Patients were divided into two groups, GIB and non-GIB. We examined baseline characteristics of sex and age, as well as comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HF), and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. We used T-test for statistical analysis of age and Pearson's chisquared test for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes of acute kidney injury, vasopressor use, and mechanical ventilation. Results: Of 2,711 patients, 205 (incidence of 8.18%) developed GIB. Overall sample characteristics included mean age of 71.15 (SD=16.36) and 63.36 (SD=19.26) for GIB and non-GIB groups, respectively. Males comprised 54.6% of the GIB group and 54.1% of the non-GIB group. Baseline clinical characteristics except for sex significantly differed between groups (p<0.05). The odds of all-cause mortality (OR: 2.604, 95% CI: 1.947, 3.482, p <0.001) were significantly higher in the GIB group. For secondary outcomes, patients with GIB had increased unadjusted odds for acute kidney injury (OR: 3.238, 95% CI: 2.387, 4.392, p <0.001), vasopressor use (OR: 3.004, 95% CI: 2.242, 4.023, p<0.001), and mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.806, 95% CI: 2.079, 3.787, p<0.001). Conclusion: GIB is associated with increased odds for all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and acute kidney injury compared to patients without GIB. Despite having largely differing baseline characteristics, these findings support studies that suggest a correlation between GI symptoms and Covid-19 disease severity. Future research with a larger sample size is needed.

This test is used to obtain histologic diagnosis, to assess resectability because of unanticipated locoregional spread, and to ensure negative margins after resection. We sought to define the accuracy and clinical usefulness of intraoperative frozen section analysis in patients with pancreatic lesions and to determine the impact on long-term outcomes. METHODS A retrospective database review was performed for all patients who underwent pancreatic resection at our institution from 2002 to 2011. Patient demographics, indications for frozen section analysis, final pathology, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Five-year survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were identified (mean age 65  14 years, 52% female). Malignancy was identified on final pathology in 38 (56%) patients. Intraoperative frozen section analysis was performed in 59 (87%) patients. Frozen section analysis was performed for histologic diagnosis in 6 (10%) cases, to determine resectability in 15 (25%) cases, and to evaluate margin status in 58 (98%) cases. Frozen section analysis for histologic diagnosis was associated with a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 50% with an overall accuracy of 83%. Frozen section analysis for the determination of resectability was associated with a sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 58% with an overall accuracy of 66%. Intraoperative frozen section analysis for the determination of the final margin status was associated with a sensitivity of 33%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 97% with an overall accuracy of 97%. There were no false-positive results on frozen section analysis. Errors on frozen section analysis interpretation did not negatively impact survival outcomes (mean survival = 2.2 years in those with concordant frozen section analysis vs 1.7 years in those with discordant frozen section analysis, P = .69). CONCLUSIONS Although intraoperative frozen section analysis is helpful for ensuring negative final margins, its usefulness for obtaining histologic diagnosis and determining resectability is limited by low negative predictive potential. These results highlight the importance of preoperative staging and intraoperative surgical judgment for questionable resectable disease.","output":"Examining the accuracy and clinical usefulness of intraoperative frozen section analysis in the management of pancreatic lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"VeriAbs is a strategy selection based reachability verifier for C code.

New job scheduling techniques are crucial for the effective integration and management of IoT with grid computing as they provide optimal computational solutions. The computational grid is a modern technology that enables distributed computing to take advantage of a organizations resources in order to handle complex computational problems. However, the scheduling process is considered an NP-hard problem due to the heterogeneity of resources and management systems in the IoT grid.

In the proposed greedy firefly algorithm, a greedy method is utilized as a local search mechanism to enhance the rate of convergence and efficiency of schedules produced by the standard firefly algorithm. Several experiments were conducted using the GridSim toolkit to evaluate the proposed greedy firefly algorithms performance. The study measured several sizes of real grid computing workload traces, starting with lightweight traces with only 500 jobs, then typical with 3000 to 7000 jobs, and finally heavy load containing 8000 to 10,000 jobs. The experiment results revealed that the greedy firefly algorithm could insignificantly reduce the makespan makespan and execution times of the IoT grid scheduling process as compared to other evaluated scheduling methods.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate neighborhood-level deprivation and English language proficiency effect on disproportionate outcomes seen in racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in Minnesota between March 4, 2020, and August 19, 2020 PATIENTS: Polymerase chain reactionCpositive COVID-19 patients EXPOSURES: Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and primary language MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity, using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis as a marker of severity. Logistic and competing-risk regression models assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race, effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 5577 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included; 866 (n = 15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 vs. 40.4 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (n = 425 [49.1%] vs. 2049 [43.5%], p = 0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n = 381), 19.9% (n = 172), 18.6% (n = 161), and 11.8% (n = 102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity: Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72C5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74C3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15C1.94). ADI was not associated with hospitalization. Non-English-speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51C2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups.

We describe our long term experience with everolimus and give a thorough review of the therapeutic strategies used so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 4 patients (mean age 46 years, range 37-55) with progressing thymic NEN (two well differentiated atypical carcinoids and two atypical carcinoids with large cell characteristics) were treated with everolimus 10 mg/d after failure of at least one previous medical therapy. Everolimus was applied after a mean interval of 32.4 months (range 5 - 56) after first diagnosis. The follow up included clinical examination, imaging, and chromogranin A testing in 3 or 6 monthly intervals. RESULTS: We observed stable disease for a mean of 20.8 months. Both patients with large cell characteristics thymic NEN (Ki-67 of 20 %) had rapid progress after 7 and 10 months and had more previous therapies (3 and 6) than the patients with well differentiated thymic NEN (Ki-67 5 % and 10 %, progress after 24 and 42 months, 1 and 2 previous therapies).

In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHOD: The data of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients who received anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-containing CP along with the antiviral treatment (n = 888) and an age-gender, comorbidity, and other COVID-19 treatments matched severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients at 1:1 ratio (n = 888) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Duration in the intensive care unit (ICU), the rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) support and vasopressor support were lower in CP group compared with the control group (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively). The case fatality rate (CFR) was 24.7 % in the CP group, and it was 27.7 % in the control group. Administration of CP 20 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis or COVID-19 related symptoms were associated with a higher rate of MV support compared with the first 3 interval groups (&#8804;5 days, 6-10 days, 11-15 days) (p=0.001).

As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligandCreceptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2. As phage display is an important technique for antibody selection, this review presents a concise summary of the very recent applications of phage display technique with a special reference to progress in diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus diseases. Hopefully, this technique can complement studies on hostCpathogen interactions and assist novel strategies of drug discovery for coronaviruses.","output":"Phage Display Technique as a Tool for Diagnosis and Antibody Selection for Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article creatively presents a framework of conducting expressive arts therapy online during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This article uses artificial intelligence-assisted medical imaging diagnosis as the research object, combines artificial intelligence and CT medical imaging diagnosis, introduces an intelligent COVID-19 detection system, and uses it to achieve COVID-19 disease screening and lesion evaluation. CT examination has the advantages of fast speed and high accuracy, which can provide a favorable basis for clinical diagnosis. This article collected 32 lung CT scan images of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Two professional radiologists analyzed the CT images using traditional imaging diagnostic methods and artificial intelligence-assisted imaging diagnostic methods, and the comparison showed the gap between the two methods. According to experiments, CT imaging diagnosis assisted by artificial intelligence only takes 0.744 min on average, which can save a lot of time and cost compared with the average time of 3.623 min for conventional diagnosis.

In this regard, the present study was conducted to analyze the rate of cases and mortality due to the COVID-19 virus in Iran and the world. Moreover, a comparison was made between the mortality rates due to COVID-19 and the 34 leading causes of mortality worldwide. A fourth-degree polynomial ARIMA model was applied to examine the variable death cases in Iran and the world. Reviewing monthly statistics in Iran has shown that in a period of 11months, from February 19, 2020, to January 19, 2021, the country has encountered three major peaks of corona-infected cases. In Iran, the highest number of active and dead cases were detected from November 21 to December 20, 2020, with 330,007 and October 22 to November 20, 2020, with 12,550 individuals, respectively. However, a worldwide survey showed that the highest number of active and dead cases were found in North America and Europe in December 2020. Implementation of two periods of complete quarantine [February 21CDecember 20, 2020 and November 12CDecember 1, 2020] have had a great impact on reducing coronavirus infections and deaths in the following months in Iran.

(2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 354 patients with Enterobacterales urinary tract infections (UTIs), determined their antibiotic resistance pattern, thus aiming to correlate them with the outcome and other specific markers of poor prognosis. (3) Results: The most frequent causative agent was Escherichia coli, representing 64.6% of all UTIs. We identified 154 patients resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, of which 126 were multidrug-resistant (MDR), 17 were extensive drug-resistant (XDR) and 11 were pandrug-resistant (PDR). Moreover, 25 isolates were resistant to carbapenems (CRE), 25 were difficult-to-treat (DTR), and 84 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (ESC), with only 95 isolates susceptible to all tested antibiotics. Mortality ranged from 1% for UTIs caused by isolates susceptible to all tested antibiotics, to 24% for the ones caused by DTR or CRE isolates. Other significant risk factors associated with mortality were: prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.0001), Charlson comorbidity index  3 (p = 0.02), urinary catheterization (p = 0.001), associated respiratory pathologies (p = 0.004), obesity (p = 0.047), a history of previous hospitalizations (p = 0.007), inappropriate empiric antibiotic regimen (p = 0.001), or hyper inflammatory status (p = 0.006).

However, the potential risks associated with these drugs remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic disease taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. METHODS: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease taking DMARDs with or without long-term (> 6 months) HCQ treatment prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were selected consecutively. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the history of symptoms suggestive of the disease and/or serum IgG positivity. During statistical analysis, the risk of COVID-19 infection was calculated in rheumatic patients taking DMARDs versus controls, as well as in patients taking HCQ versus those who are not. The ORs and 95% CIs were also calculated. The participants in the control group were selected from individuals without RD. RESULTS: A total of 800 patients with RD and 449 controls were analyzed. COVID-19 infection was detected in 16.8% of rheumatic patients versus 17.6% of controls (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.7-1.28). The proportions of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users versus non-users were 15.3% and 18.1%, respectively (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61-1.26). These results remained unchanged after adjusting for all covariates using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rheumatic patients taking DMARDs are not at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and that HCQ therapy has no influence on the risk of COVID-19 infection. Key points a? The risk of COVID-19 infection is not higher in patients with RD on DMARD therapy. a? The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users has not significant difference relative to non-users. a? Significant percent of RD patients taking DMARDs had asymptomatic infection. a?

Most NDCs include targets to mitigate national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which need quantifications to assess i.a. whether the current NDCs collectively put us on track to reach the PA temperature goals or the gap in ambition to do so. We implemented the new open-source tool NDCmitiQ to quantify GHG mitigation targets defined in the NDCs for all countries with quantifiable targets on a disaggregated level and to create corresponding national and global emissions pathways. In light of the 5-year update cycle of NDCs and the global stocktake, the quantification of NDCs is an ongoing task for which NDCmitiQ can be used, as calculations can easily be updated upon submission of new NDCs. In this paper, we describe the methodologies behind NDCmitiQ and quantification challenges we encountered by addressing a wide range of aspects, including target types and the input data from within NDCs;external time series of national emissions, population, and GDP;uniform approach vs. country specifics;share of national emissions covered by NDCs;how to deal with the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) component and the conditionality of pledges;and establishing pathways from single-year targets. For use in NDCmitiQ, we furthermore construct an emissions data set from the baseline emissions provided in the NDCs. Example use cases show how the tool can help to analyse targets on a national, regional, or global scale and to quantify uncertainties caused by a lack of clarity in the NDCs. Results confirm that the conditionality of targets and assumptions about economic growth dominate uncertainty in mitigated emissions on a global scale, which are estimated as 48.9C56.1 Gt CO2eq.

AIM: This study was conducted in 12,069 T2D patients from northern India to find out which clinical and biochemical features are related to lean, normal weight, and overweight/obese T2D patients. METHODS: The study was conducted at two endocrine clinics in northern India as a retrospective cross-sectional study. The records of all patients who attended these clinics from January 2018 to December 2019 were screened. After screening 13,400 patients, 12,069 were labelled as type 2 diabetes mellitus according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association, 2020, and were included in the study. The patients were subdivided into the three groups by their body mass index (BMI): lean (BMI < 18), normal weight (BMI = 18-22.9), overweight/obese (BMI  23). The study evaluated how the three subgroups responded to standard diabetes management, including antidiabetic medication and lifestyle interventions. RESULTS: Of a total of 12,069 patients 327 (2.7%) were lean, 1,841 (15.2%) of normal weight, and 9,906 (82.1%) overweight/obese. Lean patients were younger, but had more severe episodes of hyperglycemia. All three subgroups experienced significant improvements in glycemic control during follow-up; HbA1c values were significantly lowered in the overweight/obese group during follow-up compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: While overweight/obese patients could benefit from the improvements in glycemic control achieved by lowering HbA1c, lean and normal-weight patients had more severe and difficult-to-control hyperglycemia.","output":"Clinical Features, Biochemical Profile, and Response to Standard Treatment in Lean, Normal-Weight, and Overweight/Obese Indian Type 2 Diabetes Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rat C6 glial cells were resistant to infection by several strains of murine coronaviruses.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the data sources are not reported in the manuscript. Study selection The authors included six studies on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in humans. Studies comprised of two randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised trials both of which were non-blinded and open-label and one that was uncontrolled, a prospective cohort study and an interim report. The authors did not report details of any studies that were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis The data extraction methodology was not reported and it is unclear if the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Treatment regimens and the study outcomes were extracted where available and overall findings were presented in a table. There were no comparable outcome measures; therefore, results were deemed unsuitable to combine and no statistical analyses were carried out. A narrative synthesis of each study is presented. Results The results of the studies in this rapid review are difficult to quantify as each study had different outcome parameters. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, results were not combined, and no statistical analysis was carried out. Narrative synthesis of each of the included studies identified important and significant limitations, precluding the studies from demonstrating a statistically significant difference in outcomes. Conclusions This review highlights the urgent need for more high quality evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The results of the studies included should be interpreted with caution due to the weak supporting data and numerous methodological limitations. The authors suggested that the studies be viewed as hypothesis-generating and should not be used in decision making around the recommendations and guidelines in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. There are currently several ongoing randomised controlled trials looking at the effectiveness and efficacy of these drugs on COVID-19. It is hoped the outcome of these studies can help guide future recommendations and national guidelines.","output":"Are hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine effective in the treatment of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19)?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, one kind of acid-alkali modified sludge-based biochar (ASBC) was synthesized, characterized, and employed as adsorbent for the removal of pefloxacin. The characterization results showed that the specific surface area (SSA) of ASBC (53.381 m2/g) was significantly higher than that of SBC (24.411 m2/g). ASBC had a rougher surface, larger particle distribution, lower zero point charge, and richer functional groups (e.g., C-O and O-H) than SBC. The adsorption capacity of ASBC was 1.82 times than that of SBC. After 8 adsorption cycles in reuse experiment, the adsorption capacity of ASBC for pefloxacin still reached 144.08 mg/L, indicating that ASBC has good reusability. Static experiments showed that the optimal pH value was 6.0 in the adsorption of pefloxacin on SBC and ASBC. The result of adsorption kinetics indicated that the pseudo-second-order model could describe well the adsorption process. The Freundlich model was better than the Langmuir model to describe the adsorption of pefloxacin by ASBC, indicating that the adsorption process was mainly multilayer adsorption. Thermodynamic result showed that the adsorption of pefloxacin by ASBC was spontaneous and endothermic. The removal mechanism of pefloxacin by ASBC is mainly the substitution reaction and - EDA interaction. In summary, acid-alkali modified biochar is an effective adsorbent for pefloxacin in aqueous solution, and has great application prospects.","output":"Efficient removal of pefloxacin from aqueous solution by acid-alkali modified sludge-based biochar: adsorption kinetics, isotherm, thermodynamics, and mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected tens of millions of people globally since it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020.

The 2019 SARS-CoV2 pandemic mandated programs conduct interviews virtually for the first time. The purpose of this study was to assess applicant perspectives on the virtual interview. METHODS A Qualtrics survey assessing applicant characteristics and attitudes toward the virtual interview was designed and disseminated to otorhinolaryngology applicants from 3 large academic institutions in the 2020 to 2021 application cycle. RESULTS A total of 33% of survey applicants responded. Most applicants were satisfied with the virtual interview process. Applicants reported relatively poor quality of interactions with residents and an inability to assess the \\"feel\\" of a geographic area. Most applicants received at least 11 interviews with over a third of applicants receiving >16 interviews. Only 5% of applicants completed >20 interviews. Most applicants believed interviews should be capped between 15 and 20 interviews. Most applicants reported saving >$5000, with over a quarter of applicants saving >$8000, and roughly one-third of applicants saving at least 2 weeks of time with virtual versus in-person interviews. CONCLUSIONS While virtual interviews have limitations, applicants are generally satisfied with the experience. Advantages include cost and time savings for both applicants and programs, as well as easy use of technology.

This is surprising as self-regulation, and thus using such strategies, is very important here. In this setting, we studied the relation between basic executive functions (i.e., working memory and shifting, measured with cognitive tests) and reported SRL-strategy use (i.e., management of time and effort, complex and simple cognitive strategy use, contacts with others, and academic thinking) within a correlational design with 889 adult online distance students. In this study, we performed regression analyses and took age and processing speed into consideration, as processing speed and EFs decrease with age, whereas self-regulation is reported to increase with age. Cognitively measured working memory was not related to reported SRL-strategy use in adult ODE students. Thus, even though the SRL-components within the strategies seem to elicit working memory, reported SRL-strategy use is not related to the functioning of this basic EF (measured with cognitive tests). This means that if SRL-strategy use needs to be increased in adult ODE students, training of working memory might not be an effective manner for achieving that goal. Better shifting and processing speed were related to less reported SRL-strategy use, which might suggest that SRL-strategies might be used to compensate for lower shifting (in academic thinking) and lower processing speed (in simple cognitive strategy use and contacts with others). With increasing age, the number of contacts with peers or teachers decreases. This latter finding might be of relevance during the pandemic since contacts with others is importance during lockdown.","output":"The Relation Between Cognitively Measured Executive Functions and Reported Self-Regulated Learning Strategy Use in Adult Online Distance Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite recent declines in new pediatric HIV infections and childhood HIV-related deaths, pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in HIV-infected children under 5.

METHODS: As one of the 9 sites for the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study, we enrolled children 1C59 months of age presenting to University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, with World Health OrganizationCdefined severe and very severe pneumonia. Controls frequency-matched on age group and HIV infection status were enrolled from the Lusaka Pediatric HIV Clinics as well as from the surrounding communities. Clinical assessments, chest radiographs (CXR; cases) and microbiologic samples (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, blood, urine, induced sputum) were obtained under highly standardized procedures. Etiology was estimated using Bayesian methods and accounted for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of measurements. RESULTS: Of the 617 cases and 686 controls enrolled in Zambia over a 24-month period, 103 cases (16.7%) and 85 controls (12.4%) were HIV infected and included in this analysis. Among the HIV-infected cases, 75% were <1 year of age, 35% received prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 13.6% received antiretroviral therapy and 36.9% of caregivers reported knowing their childrens HIV status at time of enrollment. A total of 35% of cases had very severe pneumonia and 56.3% had infiltrates on CXR.

Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province-level in Iran. Therefore, in the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how socioeconomic and climatic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. The analyses are applied to cumulative cases of the disease from February 19th to March 18th. They correspond to obtaining maps associated with quartiles for rates of COVID-19 cases smoothed through a Bayesian technique and relative risks, the calculation of global (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), both univariate and bivariate, to derive significant clustering, and the fit of a multivariate spatial lag model considering a set of variables potentially affecting the presence of the disease. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran (p-value< 0.05), indicating that the COVID-19 spread within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases (p-value < 0.05). Interestingly, literacy is a factor that is associated with a decrease in the number of cases (p-value < 0.05), which might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be useful to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread in Iran. One limitation of our analysis is that the most updated information we found concerning socioeconomic and climatic features is not for 2020, or even for a same year, so that the obtained associations should be interpreted with caution. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within Iran.","output":"Spatial analysis of COVID-19 spread in Iran: Insights into geographical and structural transmission determinants at a province level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a stochastic model for epidemic spreading of the novel coronavirus based in data supported by the Brazilian health agencies.

Despite public health awareness campaigns, DKA rates have not fallen over the last decade. T1D has a long prodrome, and it is now possible to identify children who go on to develop T1D with a high degree of certainty. The reasons for identifying children presymptomatically include prevention of DKA and related morbidities and mortality, reducing the need for hospitalisation, time to provide emotional support and education to ensure a smooth transition to insulin treatment, and opportunities for new treatments to prevent or delay progression. Research studies of population-based screening strategies include using islet autoantibodies alone or in combination with genetic risk factors, both of which can be measured from a capillary sample. If found during screening, the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies has a high positive predictive value for future T1D in childhood (under 18 years), offering an opportunity for DKA prevention. However, a single time-point test will not identify all children who go on to develop T1D, and so combining with genetic risk factors for T1D may be an alternative approach.

Specifically, MED12 is an integral part of the kinase module of Mediator along with MED13, CyclinC (CycC) and CDK8. Structural studies have indicated that MED12 makes a direct connection to CycC through a specific interface and thereby functions to create a link between MED13 and CycC-CDK8. Disruption of the MED12-CycC interface often leads to dysregulated CDK8 kinase activity, which has important physiological implications. For example, a number of studies have indicated that mutations within MED12 can lead to the formation of benign or malignant tumors, either as a result of MED12-CycC disruption or through distinct independent mechanisms. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that the N-terminal portion of MED12 forms a direct connection to CDK8. Mutations within MED12 do not appear to disrupt the physical connection to CDK8, but rather abrogate CDK8 kinase activity. Thus, mutations in MED12 can cause disruption of CDK8 kinase activity through two separate mechanisms. The aim of the present review article was to discuss the MED12 mutational landscape in a variety of benign and malignant tumors, as well as the mechanistic basis behind tumorigenesis.

The expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli often results in an incomplete folding process that leads to the accumulation of inclusion bodies (IB), aggregates that hold a certain degree of native-like secondary structure. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) impairs intermolecular hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, leading to dissociation of aggregates under non-denaturing conditions and is therefore a useful tool to solubilize proteins for posterior refolding. Cholera toxin (CT) is composed of a non-toxic pentamer of B subunits (CTB), a useful adjuvant in vaccines, and a toxic subunit A (CTA). We studied the process of refolding of CTB using HHP. HHP was shown to be effective for dissociation of CTB monomers from IB. Posterior incubation at atmospheric pressure of concentrated CTB (1 mg/ml) is necessary for the association of the monomers. Pentameric CTB was obtained when suspensions of CTB IB were compressed at 2.4 kbar for 16 h in the presence of Tween 20 and incubated at 1 bar for 120 h. Soluble and biologically active pentameric CTB was obtained, with a yield of 213 mg CTB/liter of culture.

We performed a retrospective study to characterize pial arterial supply to dural arteriovenous fistulas and the implications for treatment. METHODS Consecutive patients evaluated over a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Angiograms were reviewed to characterize dAVF angioarchitecture and the presence of pial artery supply. Pial artery supply was categorized as dilated pre-existing dural branches and pure pial supply. We then studied the association between pial artery supply and clinical, angiographic, and treatment features. RESULTS A total of 201 patients were included of which 27 (13.4%) had pial artery supply. Of these, 11 had supply from dilated pre-existing dural branches, nine had pure pial supply,and seven had both. There was a higher rate of dAVF rupture in the pial supply group (30.8% vs 9.8%, P=0.003) and these fistulas had a higher rate of Borden 2 and 3 (88.9% vs 38.4%, P<0.0001). Fistulas with pial artery supply had similar rates of endovascular and gamma knife treatment, but were more likely to undergo surgery than those without pial supply (25.9% vs 10.4%, P=0.03). Major complication rates were similar between groups (0% vs 1.1%, P=0.55). CONCLUSIONS More than 10% of dAVFs also have pial supply but this is not a contraindication to embolization.

Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By combining functional dynamics analysis and ensemble-based alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we found that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. Our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions.

This intervention, known as shielding, could be implemented in various ways. If shielded people are grouped together in residences and isolation is imperfect, any introduction of infections within the shielding group could cause substantial mortality and thus negate the interventions benefits. We explored the effectiveness of shielding under various modalities of implementation and considered mitigation measures to reduce its possible harms. MethodsWe used an individual-based mathematical model to simulate the evolution of a COVID-19 epidemic in a population of which a fraction above a given age cut-off are relocated to shielding residences, in which they have variable levels of contacts with their original household, the outside world and fellow shielding residents. We set our simulation with the context of an internally displaced persons camp in Somaliland, for which we had recently collected data on household demographics and social mixing patterns. We compared an unmitigated epidemic with a shielding intervention accompanied by various measures to reduce the risk of virus introduction and spread within the shielding residences. We did sensitivity analyses to explore parameters such as residence size, reduction in contacts, basic reproduction number, and prior immunity in the population. ResultsShielded residences are likely to be breached with infection during the outbreak. Nonetheless, shielding can be effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in the shielded population. The effectiveness of shielding is mostly affected by the size of the shielded residence, and by the degree by which contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced. Reductions in contacts between shielded individuals could further increase the effectiveness of shielding, but is only effective in larger shielded residences. Large shielded residences increase the risk of infection, unless very large reductions in contacts can be achieved. In epidemics with a lower reproduction number, the effectiveness of shielding could be negative effectiveness. DiscussionShielding could be an effective method to protect the most at-risk individuals. It should be considered where other measures cannot easily be implemented, but with attention to the epidemiological situation. Shielding should only be implemented through small to medium-sized shielding residences, with appropriate mitigation measures such as reduced contact intensity between shielded individuals and self-isolation of cases to prevent subsequent spread.","output":"Shielding individuals at high risk of COVID-19: a micro-simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The Paris Agreement establishes a process to combine Nationally Determined Contributions with the long-term goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 C and even to 1.5 C.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;200). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, -2 to 6]; P = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, -21% [95% CI, -38% to -3%]; P = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; P = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -17% to 15%]; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.

The duration of scholarly journals publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found. While the acceleration of journals publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises concerns relating to the quality of the peer review process and the quality of the resulting publications.","output":"Pandemic Publishing: Medical journals drastically speed up their publication process for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current research has found dramatic changes in the lives of those with eating disorders (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We build on existing research to investigate the long-term effects and adaptations that people with EDs have faced due to COVID-19 related changes. METHOD: We collected 234 posts from three separate time periods from the subreddit r/EatingDisorders and analyzed them using thematic analysis. The posts were examined for initial patterns, and then those concepts were grouped into themes to reveal the authentic experiences of people living with EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Initially, we found lack of control and familial influences (loved ones seeking support) emerge as themes within our broader data set throughout all three timeframes. There were additional themes that were present in only one or two of the collection periods. These themes consisted of symptom stress, technical stresses and concerns, and silver linings. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that people with EDs have fought significantly during the pandemic. Initially, the (lack of) control and routine in their lives has caused symptoms to become more challenging, while being forced to move back home also caused significant stress. However, concerns transformed as the pandemic progressed, resulting in new pressures causing people to exhibit novel ED symptoms or relapse altogether. Also notable is the relatively few COVID-specific posts as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that people have accepted COVID as their new normal and begun to build resilience to the challenges associated. These are vital factors for clinicians to consider as they begin taking existing and new patients, particularly as face-to-face treatment options become a possibility again. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Existing research shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the lives of people who live with eating disorders in various ways. First, the pandemic has placed barriers on the path to recovery by limiting coping mechanism (and sometimes removing them altogether) and changing their relationships with food and the people in their lives. Second, the pandemic has forced treatment options to change since ED patients can no longer seek treatment face-to-face. Finally, there have been unexpected benefits to the pandemic, such as allowing individuals time to slow down and focus on their mental health. Previous studies examined individuals in clinical contexts rather than in their natural environments. We explored an online forum for people with eating disorders for the various themes that were discussed at three points over the period of March 2020-December 2020 and found that many people with EDs report worsening symptoms or relapse. However, we also noted that, compared to the beginning of the pandemic, people seemed to be less frequently asking for support during the third data collection period, implying an adaptation to the new normal of life in a pandemic. We conclude with a discussion of the findings.","output":"Understanding the conversation around COVID-19 and eating disorders: A thematic analysis of Reddit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is devoted to the study of the academic and existential problems of students during the pandemic. The authors conducted sociological surveys among first-and second-year students of a higher educational institution, where they analyze students attitudes towards distance learning and identify the most pressing existential problems of students. The authors concluded that during the quarantine period, learning has lost its semantic basis. The reason for this is the inability of the education system to respond to the challenges of the new educational format, as it develops in accordance with the modern technology, as modern pedagogy develops, as a rational system of objective knowledge, and as it does not take into account the internal, value-based meanings of education itself. The authors see a solution to this problem in shifting the emphasis from transferring knowledge to helping students find personal meanings that coincide with the objectives of philosophical practice. The authors give examples of how the techniques of philosophical practice could unlock students potential in understanding and solving existential problems. ? 2021 by Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia.

Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma at up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which were also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also possessed NAbs against SARS-CoV Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and neutralization assays reveal the wide range of the humoral immune response to virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to investigate space and time clusters of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection and to determine risk factors at the subdistrict level in Thailand.

However, their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined. Real-time PCR or western blotting analysis was used to detect Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), WWP2, p27, p-STAT6 and STAT6 expression levels as well as the activity of RhoA and Rac1 in lung cancer. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo. The correlation between WWP2 and p27 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis. We found that ARHGAP24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and independent hospital database. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of RhoA and Rac1, induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G(0)CG(1) phase. ARHGAP24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and WWP2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase through activating STAT6 signaling. ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression. Moreover, WWP2 was found interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis.","output":"ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission and spread of infectious disease like Covid-19 occurs through horizontal and vertical mode.

In this study, GA was loaded onto niosomes to produce gallic acid nanoemulsion (GANE) using a green synthesis technique. GANEs efficiency, morphology, UV absorption, release, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were evaluated. An in vitro study was conducted on the A549 lung carcinoma cell line to determine the GANE cytotoxicity. Also, our study was extended to evaluate the protective effect of GANE against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. GANE showed higher encapsulation efficiency and strong absorption at 280 nm. Transmission electron microscopy presented a spherical shape of the prepared nanoparticles, and FTIR demonstrated different spectra for the free gallic acid sample compared to GANE. GANE showed cytotoxicity for the A549 carcinoma lung cell line with a low IC(50) value. It was found that oral administration of GANE at 32.8 and 82 mg/kg.b.w. and dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) provided significant protection against LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. GANE enhanced production of superoxide dismutase, GPx, and GSH. It simultaneously reduced the MDA level. The GANE and dexamethasone, induced the production of IL-4, but suppressed TNF- and IL-6. On the other hand, the lung p38MAPK, TGF-1, and NF-B gene expression was downregulated in rats administrated with GANE when compared with the LPS-treated rats. Histological studies confirmed the effective effect of GANE as it had a lung-protective effect against LPS-induced lung fibrosis. It was noticed that GANE can inhibit oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cytokines and downregulate p38MAPK, TGF-1, and NF-B gene expression to suppress the proliferation and migration of lung fibrotic cells.","output":"GANE can Improve Lung Fibrosis by Reducing Inflammation via Promoting p38MAPK/TGF-1/NF-B Signaling Pathway Downregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Anaphylaxis represents non-atopic immediate hypersensitivity, whereas manifestations of atopic immediate hypersensitivity include bronchial asthma, hay fever, allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis. In spite similar antigen exposure, only a minority of the population shown some form of atopic disease. Atopic disease with its spontaneous pattern of familial occurrence cannot be induced at will. The exact pathogenesis of atopy is yet to be elucidated. Two theories prevail: 1) atopy is a primary disorder of the immune system with sequelae in the various effector tissues; and 2) a concept of atopy as a primary autonomic imbalance, essentially beta adrenergic in character, with sequelae in effector cells, including those engaged in the production of antibodies. The autonomic imbalance is perceived as caused not by some disorder of the autonomic nervous system itself but by a defector functioning of its effector cells. These two concepts are not mutually exclusive. The IgE antibody, which mediates allergic reactions, is essentially identical with atopic reagin in various animal species. The beta adrenergic theory regards atopic disorders (i.e., perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis) not as immunologic diseases but as unique patterns of altered reactivities to a broad spectrum of immunologic, psychic, infectious, chemical and physical stimuli. The antigen-antibody interaction is given the same role as that of a broad category of nonspecific stimuli that function only to trigger the same defective homeostatic mechanism in the various effector cells involved in immediate hypersensitivities. Current evidence favors the possibility that there are inherited and/or acquired multiple abnormalities in the receptoradenylate cyclasecyclic AMP system of all effector cells that are critical in the organization of immune reactivities. Atopic abnormality may be 1) acquired by functional receptor regulatory shifts caused by hormonal changes, infection (viral, bacterial, etc), allergic tissue injury or other event; 2) genetically determined; or 3) caused by autoimmune disease. One, two or all three of these effector mechanisms may be operative in a particular disease. There is an important relationship between asthma and viral respiratory infection. A history of childhood viral respiratory illness is a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive airway syndromes in later life. Asthmatic attacks occurred only when the infection produced fever, malaise, cough or coryza. The dominant role of fever in these episodes immediately suggests the profound involvement of adrenergic effector mechanisms. The presence of autoantibodies to beta-adrenoceptors in patients correlated well with a reduced betaand an increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness. Virus infections can elicit autoantibody formation. In patients with atopic dermatitis an increased susceptibility and abnormal host response to viral infections in general. Defective cytotoxic T cells, abnormally functioning macrophages and natural killer cells, a reduced production of IFN in children, and of IFN in atopic patients with food allergy has recently been demonstrated. Lymphocytic cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase, that destroys cyclic AMP, is increased in atopic dermatitis and in allergic respiratory disease of adults, and this increased activity correlated closely with histamine release from basophils. Peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis have frequently demonstrated impaired beta adrenergic reactivity. Allergic tissue injury may be initiated by antigen-specific IgE antibodies that combine with Fc receptors on various cell types and trigger mediator release upon encounter with the antigen. Various noxious agents that are capable of triggering asthma are capable of releasing inflammatory mediators from the same target cells. Accounting only for those pharmacologic mediators where the cell-type has been identified, the spectrum of mediator-storing, synthesizing, or transporting cells includes neutrophil leucocytes, basophilic leucocytes eosinophilic leucocytes; mast cells, chromaffin-positive mast cells, enterochromaffin cells, chromaffin cells; platelets, neurosecretory cells and nerve cells that potentially produce all amine-mediators as well as prostaglandins and kinins.","output":"Virus associated immune and pharmacologic mechanisms in disorders of respiratory and cutaneous atopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the world.

When occupied by linoleic acid, it reduces infectivity, by locking the spike in a less infectious conformation. Here, we use dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to compare the response of spike variants to linoleic acid removal. These simulations show that the fatty acid site is coupled to functional regions of the protein, some of them far from the site (e.g. in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, the furin cleavage site located in position 679-685 and the fusion peptide-surrounding regions) and identify the allosteric networks involved in these connections. Comparison of the response of the original (Wuhan) spike with four variants: Alpha, Delta, Delta plus and Omicron BA.1 show that the variants differ significantly in their response to linoleic acid removal.

The current study further examined this proposal by testing the effects of lithium, valproate and imipramine on SSP in three strains of mice (male mice from the black Swiss, ICR and C57bl/6 strains) and an exploratory test in females (black Swiss strain). RESULTS Data demonstrate that lithium and valproate at appropriate dosing schedules significantly and reliably reduce SSP in all three strains (including in females) but that the antidepressant imipramine has no effects. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS The results support the utilization of the SSP as mice screening model for anti-manic effects of drugs with stronger predictive validity compared with other methods. CONCLUSIONS The SSP is not a comprehensive model for bipolar disorder but it has good predictive validity and strong practical value that can be applied towards simple and fast screening of large numbers of animals, without the need for specialized equipment or complicated/prolonged procedures. We therefore propose that the SSP is an advantageous screening assay for testing novel mood stabilizing drugs for anti-manic properties.","output":"Proposing the sweet solution preference test as a screening assay for anti-manic effects of mood stabilizers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19 METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020 A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media;it required 5 minutes to complete A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0 05 RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85 6%);51 6% were males, 32 1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30 2%) and medical students (29 6%) Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63 6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19 CONCLUSIONS: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted CLINICALTRIAL: INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT: RR2-10 1101/2020 03 09 20033381","output":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions: A Survey of Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Toxic alcohols have been implicated in accidental ingestions and intentional exposures. Recognition of toxic alcohol poisoning is challenging. The main treatment modalities include antidotes with alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors and dialysis. Current guidelines exist for both methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication. However, treatment consensus related to other toxic alcohols is limited. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding thresholds for when to initiate antidotes and dialysis persist. As a consequence, variations exist in the interventions utilized for management of all toxic alcohol poisonings. To our knowledge, no prior systematic review of clinical outcomes of toxic alcohols exists. The objective of this study is to summarize existing evidence on short- and long-term outcomes of patients following toxic alcohol poisonings, including methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, and diethylene glycol. METHODS A literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE will be performed based on pre-determined criteria. There will be no restrictions on publication dates or languages. The search will be supplemented by manual scan of bibliographies of eligible studies and gray literature assessment. Observational studies and clinical trials will be included in this review. Once eligible studies have been selected based on pre-specified criteria, two investigators will extract relevant data independently and perform quality assessment per validated tools. A pooled analysis of mortality and short- and long-term secondary outcomes will be performed. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed according to the type of toxic alcohol intoxication, mode of renal replacement therapy, and medical interventions received. A meta-analysis will be performed if three or more studies with similar populations, type of toxic alcohol poisoning, and outcome measures, as well as adequate quality, are identified. This review will be reported according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to synthesize current evidence in the short- and long-term outcomes of post-toxic alcohol poisoning. The results will enhance the understanding of patient morbidity and mortality after toxic alcohol poisoning, help inform uniform concrete management guideline development, identify gaps in the current state of knowledge, and provide evidence to help implement post-treatment follow-up.

Previous studies have documented that stigma and limited knowledge about MAT are prevalent among CJ court personnel. We describe development and pilot testing of an eLearning intervention to improve MAT knowledge and increase MAT referrals in Ohio courts. Methods: Building upon a nationwide survey conducted in 2011 of drug courts and informed by MAT opinions from judges who supervised OUD clients, we developed two eLearning MAT modules. Judges completed a brief online MAT knowledge-attitude scale (K-A) before, after, and at 3 months. Judges were asked about MAT referrals pretest and 3 months later. Results: Sixty-three judges expressed interest in the study, 25 completed the pretest and viewed the modules, 11 completed a 3 month posttest. At pretest, K-A scores were significantly (p<.05) lower for agonist medications than for extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; Vivitrol). K-A scores improved at posttest for agonist medications (p<.05) but declined to pretest levels three months later. Three months after the pretest, buprenorphine referrals increased from 2.6% to 9.7% (p<.05). There was no significant difference on K-A scores for agonist medication between the Ohio sample (at pretest) and the 2011 sample. Conclusion: Although there is some indication that eLearning may have strengthened knowledge gains and increased buprenorphine referrals, a more robust eLearning intervention will likely be required to increase court personnel participation and sustain eLearning knowledge gains.

Most of ARIs are of viral etiology, with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) playing a key role. This study was conducted prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to provide evidence about the sero-epidemiology of HCoVs in rural areas of Ghana. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study conducted as part of a large epidemiological study investigating the occurrence of respiratory viruses in 3 rural areas of Ghana; Buoyem, Kwamang and Forikrom. Serum samples were collected and tested for the presence of IgG-antibodies to three HCoVs; HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 using immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: of 201 subjects enrolled into the study, 97 (48.3%) were positive for all three viruses. The most prevalent virus was HCoV-229E (23%; 95% CI: 17.2 - 29.3), followed by HCoV-OC43 (17%; 95% CI: 12.4 - 23.4), then HCoV-NL63 (8%, 95% CI: 4.6 - 12.6). Subjects in Kwamang had the highest sero-prevalence for HCoV-NL63 (68.8%). human coronaviruses-229E (41.3%) and HCoV-OC43 (45.7%) were much higher in Forikrom compared to the other study areas. There was however no statistical difference between place of origin and HCoVs positivity. Although blood group O+ and B+ were most common among the recruited subjects, there was no significant association (p = 0.163) between blood group and HCoV infection. CONCLUSION: this study reports a 48.3% sero-prevalence of HCoVs (OC43, NL63 and 229E) among rural communities in Ghana. The findings provide useful baseline data that could inform further sero-epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Africa.","output":"Sero-epidemiology of human coronaviruses in three rural communities in Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data sources CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Study selection Controlled studies (randomised or non-randomised) that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE on healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to highly infectious diseases, assessed which method of donning and doffing PPE was associated with reduced risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increased compliance with PPE protocols. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for inclusion of studies. Full text articles were subsequently assessed for eligibility and disagreements were resolved through consensus. Using criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each randomised study and rated each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear. ROBINS-I tool was used for the assessment of risk of bias in non-randomised intervention studies. Where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses were conducted. Results A total of 24 studies (randomised controlled trials [RCT] [n = 14]; Quasi-RCT [n = 1] and non-randomised design [n=9]) with 2278 participants were included. Included studies compared types of PPE (n = 8), evaluated modified PPE (n = 6), procedures for donning and doffing PPE (n = 8), and types of training (n = 3). Twenty-two studies were simulation studies, of which 18 simulated exposure of HCW to contaminated body fluids using fluorescent markers or harmless microbes and measured contamination outcomes, and four studies provided modified PPE or procedures and measured compliance with donning and doffing procedures. Types of PPE Powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio [RR] 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). Gowns compared to aprons may protect better against contamination (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). Breathable types of PPE are more comfortable and may increase user satisfaction, however with little impact on contamination. Modified PPE versus standard PPE Appropriate modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE. For example, contamination can be reduced using a sealed gown and glove combination so that they can be removed together and cover the wrist area (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), tight fitting gown around the neck, wrist area and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) and added tabs to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95%nCI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Guidance on PPE use: following the guidance and recommendations from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention for doffing PPE compared to no guidance may reduce self-contamination (MD ?5.44, 95% CI ?7.43 to ?3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown compared to separate removal (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77), double gloving compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) and sanitising gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach (but not alcohol-based hand rub) may decrease contamination. Additional verbal instructions may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD ?0.9, 95% CI ?1.4 to ?0.4). User training To a vast extent, face-to-face training may reduce non-compliance with doffing guidance (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) compared to solely providing folders or videos. In addition, computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD ?1.2, 95% CI ?1.6 to ?0.7) and video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) compared to traditional lectures. Conclusions The more body parts are covered with PPE the better protection it offers. However, this is also associated and increased difficulty in donning and doffing PPE, and the PPE is less comfortable. Coveralls are the most difficult PPE to remove but may offer the best protection, followed by long gowns, gowns and aprons. The included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias, indirectness of evidence in simulation studies and small participant numbers. This increases the uncertainty about the estimates of effects, and it is likely that the true effects may be substantially different from the ones reported in this review.","output":"Which type of personal protective equipment (PPE) and which method of donning or doffing PPE carries the least risk of infection for healthcare workers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) extended 669 billion dollars of forgivable loans in an unprecedented effort to support small businesses affected by the COVID-19 crisis.

The two most probable scenarios of possible interrelations between these three comorbidities (CM) and COVID-19 are: 1) 'Triggering' - when infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe CM after bioaerosol exposure; 2) 'Reverse triggering' when exposure to bioaerosol exacerbates a symptomless or mild course of COVID-19, and evokes a severe disease.

As the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS has increased in resource-limited settings, there has been a move to develop and implement alternative treatment delivery models such as Differentiated Service Delivery (DSD) in high prevalence countries to meet the global targets for HIV treatment while maintaining the quality of care.

The selection of a university in Wuhan, China, can generate more practical implications, as Wuhan is the first city that experienced the unprecedented lockdown, and China is the first country that reopened university campuses after the lockdown.","output":"Higher education and Sustainable Development Goals during COVID-19: coping strategies of a university in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scientific community has classified COVID-19 as the worst pandemic in human history. The damage caused by the new disease was direct (e.g., deaths) and indirect (e.g., closure of economic activities). Within the latter category, we find infodemic phenomena such as the adoption of generic and stigmatizing names used to identify COVID-19 and the related novel coronavirus 2019 variants. These monikers have fostered the spread of health disinformation and misinformation and fomented racism and segregation towards the Chinese population. In this regard, we present a comprehensive infodemiological picture of Italy from the epidemic outbreak in December 2019 until September 2021. In particular, we propose a new procedure to examine in detail the web interest of users in scientific and infodemic monikers linked to the identification of COVID-19. To do this, we exploited the online tool Google Trends. Our findings reveal the widespread use of multiple COVID-19-related names not considered in the previous literature, as well as a persistent trend in the adoption of stigmatizing and generic terms. Inappropriate names for cataloging novel coronavirus 2019 variants of concern have even been adopted by national health agencies. Furthermore, we also showed that early denominations influenced user behavior for a long time and were difficult to replace. For these reasons, we suggest that the assignments of scientific names to new diseases are more timely and advise against mass media and international health authorities using terms linked to the geographical origin of the novel coronavirus 2019 variants.

The global response to COVID-19 has pushed the boundaries on what is possible for rapid pandemic response in several areas, including vaccine research, development, manufacturing, equitable distribution, allocation, and administration. If well understood and sufficiently adapted, these actions could be applied to future pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine preparedness efforts. However, developing and delivering these more effective vaccines to meet the demand goes beyond simply technical challenges and includes issues across governance, financing, research, supply chain, and public engagement. To address these challenges, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a virtual public workshop in May of 2021 to discuss the emerging evidence on unprecedented actions related to COVID-19 that could inform and advance pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine preparedness efforts and subsequent response.

None of the compounds up-regulated translation, which could be due to the screen being performed in cancer cells grown in full media where translation is already present at very high levels. Regarding translation down-regulators, and consistent with current knowledge, inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were the most represented class. In addition, we identified that inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) also reduce mRNA translation levels independently of mTOR. Mechanistically, this is explained by an effect of the compounds on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and contributes to the toxicity of SPHK inhibitors. Surprisingly, the toxicity and activation of the ISR triggered by 2 independent SPHK inhibitors, SKI-II and ABC294640, the latter in clinical trials, are also observed in cells lacking SPHK1 and SPHK2. In summary, our study provides a useful resource on the effects of medically used drugs on translation, identified compounds capable of reducing translation independently of mTOR and has revealed that the cytotoxic properties of SPHK inhibitors being developed as anticancer agents are independent of SPHKs.","output":"A chemical screen for modulators of mRNA translation identifies a distinct mechanism of toxicity for sphingosine kinase inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemics were an event where there was a rupture of the life pattern and people felt helpless and suffering, creating a need for basic things such as medical care and shelter against the environmental conditions.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV-2.Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEEDARE, and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population.

All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates.This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required.The surveillance systems have proven to be feasible and efficient in the COVID-19 pandemic, even when compared internationally.","output":"[Monitoring of COVID-19 by extending existing surveillance for acute respiratory infections]./ berwachung von COVID-19 durch Erweiterung der etablierten Surveillance fr Atemwegsinfektionen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Review, compare and critically assess digital technology responses to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. METHOD: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. RESULTS: Most countries digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individuals location databases, code scanning and individuals online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. SOLUTIONS: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). CONCLUSION: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics.

Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups. Except for the control group, CORT (40 mg per kgbw) was injected subcutaneously for 21 consecutive days to induce testicular toxicity. 1 h before CORT injection, the rats were treated with EEM (400 mg per kgbw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kgbw, 25 mg per kgbw) by gavage, except for the control group and model group. Epididymal sperm and biochemical, and histological parameters were evaluated for the protective effects of the drugs. EEM (400 mg per kgbw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kgbw, 25 mg per kgbw) increased the sperm concentration and sperm motility, decreased the production of abnormal sperms, and increased the number of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubules of CORT-induced rats. Moreover, EEM and M 18:3 decreased the MDA levels and the positive expression rates of TUNEL, whereas they increased the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and GST, and the contents of GSH in the testicles of CORT-induced rats. Furthermore, EEM and M 18:3 alleviated CORT-induced reduction in the positive expression rates of PCNA and Ki67 in the testicles of rats. Besides, EEM and M 18:3 reduced the expression levels of Keap-1 and increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, ?3-GCS, and NQO1 in the testicles of CORT-induced rats.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During an eight-week lockdown, Emergency Dental Centers (EDCs) were established and coordinated on the national level to treat patients' urgent dental conditions. Telemedicine was used on the first level of triage to reduce contacts between healthcare workers and patients. Weekly coordination between EDCs was supported by real-time data acquisition on the number of patient visits, prescribed medicine, the number and type of dental procedures, and the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: In EDCs, 27,468 patients were serviced, on average 235 patients per day/million people. The care was provided by 4798 man days of dental health care workers. Except for the first week, treatment and triage visits showed a slight increase. The number of incisions was nearly constant, while the number of extractions increased. A nearly threefold increase was found for emergency endodontic treatments (EET). The number of antibiotic prescriptions demonstrated an increasing trend. Analgesic prescriptions showed a decreasing trend from the beginning of lockdown.

However, data about this patient population are scarce. We sought to investigate differences in reperfusion and outcomes of in-hospital versus out-of-hospital STEMI. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients with STEMI all treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) across 30 centres were prospectively recruited into the Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (2013C2018). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Patients with in-hospital STEMI were compared with patients with out-of-hospital STEMI with a primary endpoint of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary endpoints included ischaemic times, all-cause mortality and major bleeding. RESULTS: Of 7493 patients with PCI-treated STEMI, 494 (6.6%) occurred in-hospital. Patients with in-hospital STEMI were older (67.1 vs 62.4 years, p<0.001), more often women (32% vs 19.9%, p<0.001), with more comorbidities. Patients with in-hospital STEMI had higher 30-day MACE (20.4% vs 9.8%, p<0.001), mortality (12.1% vs 6.9%, p<0.001) and major bleeding (4.9% vs 2.3%, p<0.001), than patients with out-of-hospital STEMI. According to guideline criteria, patients with in-hospital STEMI achieved symptom-to-device times of 70 min and 90 min in 29% and 47%, respectively.

At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10. Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.","output":"Searching for SARS-COV-2 on Particulate Matter: A Possible Early Indicator of COVID-19 Epidemic Recurrence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction : La premire vague de COVID19 a ncessit des modifications des pratiques mdicales selon les recommandations des socits savantes.

The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work. METHODS: A combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results. RESULTS: Sixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.","output":"The usefulness of pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening for disaster relief workers: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a novel approach integrating epidemiological and economic models that allows data-based simulations during a pandemic. We examine the economically optimal opening strategy that can be reconciled with the containment of a pandemic. The empirical evidence is based on data from Germany during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our empirical findings reject the view that there is necessarily a conflict between health protection and economic interests and suggest a non-linear U-shape relationship: it is in the interest of public health and the economy to balance non-pharmaceutical interventions in a manner that further reduces the incidence of infections. Our simulations suggest that a prudent strategy that leads to a reproduction number of around 0.75 is economically optimal. Too restrictive policies cause massive economic costs. Conversely, policies that are too loose lead to higher death tolls and higher economic costs in the long run. We suggest this finding as a guide for policy-makers in balancing interests of public health and the economy during a pandemic.

We aimed to investigate the association between common infections and dementia in adults (65 years) in a UK population-based cohort study. METHODS: We did a historical cohort study of individuals who were 65 years and older with no history of dementia or cognitive impairment using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between time-updated previous common infections (sepsis, pneumonia, other lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections) and incident dementia diagnosis. We also tested for effect modification by diabetes since it is an independent risk factor for dementia and co-occurs with infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, our study included 989 800 individuals (median age 686 years [IQR 650C770]; 537 602 [543%] women) of whom 402 204 (406%) were diagnosed with at least one infection and 56 802 (57%) had incident dementia during a median follow-up of 52 years (IQR 23C90). Dementia risk increased in those with any infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 153 [95% CI 150C155]) compared with those without infection. HRs were highest for sepsis (HR 208 [189C229]) and pneumonia (HR 188 [177C199]) and for infections leading to hospital admission (199 [194C204]). HRs were also higher in individuals with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. INTERPRETATION: Common infections, particularly those resulting in hospitalisation, were associated with an increased risk of dementia persisting over the long term. Whether reducing infections lowers the risk of subsequent dementia warrants evaluation.

These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within the context of the events of the day, but also reveal prevailing societal attitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing school curricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today's topics and times. In the first half of the 20th century, AJN readers were regularly reminded about the importance of hobbies. As Frances Pedersen remarked in this April 1931 article, \\"We owe it to ourselves and to our work to regularly seek refreshment of mind and body.\\" In those early decades, the journal devoted a surprising amount of time to this particular nonclinical topic. A variety of authors enthusiastically shared ideas for hobbies, such as collecting hospital postcards, or, as in Pedersen's article, gardening. Some argued that people with hobbies were more well rounded and therefore made better nurses. And some saw hobbies as essential relaxation.

Administrators are currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined students.","output":"Simulating COVID-19 in a University Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are RNA-infective viruses that could be considered principal players in universal high-profile outbreaks, namely the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002-2003), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012) and the continuing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, 2019) pandemic.

A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN- formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1 and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN- formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. These results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and IFN- formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.","output":"Inhibition of Porphyromonas gulae and periodontal disease in dogs by a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low- and middle-income countries are implementing COVID-19 vaccination strategies in light of varying vaccine efficacies and costs, supply shortages, and resource constraints.

Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop.  1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop.  280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%, n = 6) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%, n = 5). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human 18S rRNA, making PMMoV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMoV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMoV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","output":"Quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater solids in communities with low COVID-19 incidence and prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, prehospital and hospital services were put under great stress because of limited resources and increased workloads.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study based on the 2016 German-wide diagnosis related groups (DRG) statistics. Sepsis-associated hospital deaths were identified by explicit and implicit sepsis ICD-10-GM codes. Deaths were described based on clinical characteristics and place of residence by official municipality key. The proportion of sepsis-associated hospital deaths among all deaths was calculated based on the national population statistics. RESULTS: In 2016, there were 58,689 hospital deaths associated with explicitly coded sepsis (14.1% of all hospital deaths). Sepsis mortality was 73 per 100,000 inhabitants and varied 1.8-fold between federal states and 7.9-fold between districts. Of the national deaths, 6.4% were sepsis-associated hospital deaths. This proportion was highest in the 40C64 years age group (9.6%) and higher in males compared to females (7.7% vs. 5.2%). Compared to this, the proportion of deaths associated with implicitly coded sepsis was 47.2% among all hospital deaths and 21.6% among all national deaths.

Although it is known that some of these deaths may have been influenced by the overload of health systems, the world medical literature lacks data on deaths due to COVID-19 in patients who have not received medical assistance. We conducted a retrospective transversal study to report the clinical and epidemiological profile of the first 200 consecutive cases of home deaths without medical assistance caused by COVID-19 diagnosed by verbal autopsy and real-time PCR in samples of postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs, in the state of Ceara, in Northeastern Brazil. The data show a slightly increased prevalence of cases in males (57%) and an average age of 76.8 years. Previous comorbidities were reported in 85.5% of cases, the most common being cardiovascular disease (45%), neurological disease (30%), and diabetes (29%). The main symptoms reported were dyspnea (79%), fever (75.5%), cough (69%), and fatigue (42.5%). The average time between the onset of illness and death was 7.3 days, being statistically shorter in patients who had previous comorbidities (P = 0.0215).

We estimated vaccine hesitancy and status of COVID-19 vaccination in Chinese PLWH, explored the safety and impact on antiviral therapy (ART) efficacy and compared the immunogenicity of an inactivated vaccine between PLWH and healthy controls (HC). In total, 27.5% (104/378) of PLWH hesitated to take the vaccine. The barriers included concerns about safety and efficacy, and physician counselling might help patients overcome this vaccine hesitancy. A COVID-19 vaccination did not cause severe side effects and had no negative impact on CD4(+) T cell counts and HIV RNA viral load. Comparable spike receptor binding domain IgG titer were elicited in PLWH and HC after a second dose of the CoronaVac vaccine, but antibody responses were lower in poor immunological responders (CD4(+) T cell counts < 350 cells/L) compared with immunological responders (CD4(+) T cell counts  350 cells/L). These data showed that PLWH have comparable safety and immune response following inactivated COVID-19 vaccination compared with HC, but the poor immunological response in PLWH is associated with impaired humoral response.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination in People Living with HIV (PLWH) in China: A Cross Sectional Study of Vaccine Hesitancy, Safety, and Immunogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to \\"rule out\\" infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

Little empirical information is available about contact patterns within real-world social networks, let alone on differences in these contact networks between populations that differ considerably on a socio-cultural level. Here we compared contact network data that were collected in the Netherlands and Thailand using a similar online respondent-driven method. By asking participants to recruit contact persons we studied network links relevant for the transmission of respiratory infections. We studied correlations between recruiter and recruited contacts to investigate mixing patterns in the observed social network components. In both countries, mixing patterns were assortative by demographic variables and random by total numbers of contacts. However, in Thailand participants reported overall more contacts which resulted in higher effective contact rates. Our findings provide new insights on numbers of contacts and mixing patterns in two different populations. These data could be used to improve parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.

Therefore, it is necessary to study the evolution of these diseases in the presence or absence of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The present study had the following objectives: 1. to evaluate the relationship between the COVID-19 epidemic and the possible decrease in death from respiratory disease (DRd) in Chile; and 2. to study the relationships between meteorological variables and severity of COVID-19 with respect to DRd from January 2018 to February 2021. METHODS: The variable number of DRds in Chile was analyzed considering the monthly records of meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and humidity) in each region of Chile and the severity of COVID-19 to evaluate the mortality trend before and after the pandemic. For this, different nonobservable heterogeneity models for panel data were used. RESULTS: The variables that affect DRd include the number of deaths from COVID-19, which led to a decrease in DRd (negative effect) when increased, the number of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU), which led to an increase in DRd (positive effect) when increased, and the minimum temperature, which had a negative effect on DRd. These results are supported by the application of panel regression with one-way random-effects models. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a reduction in the number of DRds other than COVID-19 during the pandemic in Chile. This could be explained by the sanitary measures applied by the Ministry of Health of Chile in relation to mobility restrictions and social distancing, among others. Therefore, DRd decreased in accordance with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on deaths from respiratory diseases: Panel data evidence from Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had resulted in an unpresented global pandemic. In the initial events, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia implemented mandatory quarantine of returning travelers in order to contain COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of the arriving travelers to Quarantine facilities and the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: During the study period, there was a total of 1928 returning travelers with 1273 (66%) males. The age range was 28 daysC69 years. Of all the travelers, 23 (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the first swab, 14/1928 (0.7%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 0.63% and 0.92% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.57). The second swab was positive in 9 (0.5%) of the other 1914 who were initially negative with a positivity rate of 0.39% and 0.62% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.49). There was no statistical difference in the positivity rates between first and second swab (P = 0.4). Of all travelers, 40 (n = 26, 1.3%) were admitted from the quarantine facility to the hospital due to COVID-19 related positive results or development of symptoms such as fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms; and 14 (0.7%) were admitted due to non-COVID-19 related illness. CONCLUSION: This study showed the efforts put for facility quarantine and that such activity yielded a lower incidence of positive cases.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease without a primary cure that requires lifelong care and is characterized by pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). Wearable devices could provide a way for long-term monitoring of disease progression and early signs of PEx to intervene as early as possible, thereby improving long-term outcomes. Methods. In-hospital feasibility study (n = 26) to 1) assess the ability of Byteflies Sensor Dot to collect relevant cardiorespiratory data in people with CF and its compatibility with clinical workflows, 2) identify candidate digital biomarkers, and 3) collect user feedback from patients and healthcare providers. Results. Collected sample-level biopotential, bioimpedance and actigraphy data were of high quality. Sensor Dot heart rate (HR) correlated with hospital HR, whereas respiratory rate (RR) did not. HR and RR were associated with CF severity, and HR and coughing with PEx. Willingness to use the device was very high with CF patients and study coordinators considered the device easy-to-use. Conclusion. Determining if a wearable is fit-for-purpose is a long and multidisciplinary process that requires involvement from all stakeholders as early as possible in the development process. Our pilot identified interesting correlations between cardiorespiratory parameters as measured by the wearable, and CF severity and PEx.

Environmental health may be a critical component of COVID-19 prevention. The public health community and health agencies should consider the evolving evidence in their recommendations and statements, and work to issue relational occupational guidelines. Evidence coming from the current epidemiological and experimental research is expected to add knowledge about virus diffusion, COVID-19 severity in most polluted areas, inter-personal distance requirements and need for wearing face masks in indoor or outdoor environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for maintaining particulate matter concentrations at low levels for multiple health-related reasons, which may also include the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Indoor environments represent even a more crucial challenge to cope with, as it is easier for the SARS-COV2 to spread, remain vital and infect other subjects in closed spaces in the presence of already infected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people. The potential merits of preventive measures, such as CO(2) monitoring associated with natural or controlled mechanical ventilation and air purification, for schools, indoor public places (restaurants, offices, hotels, museums, theatres/cinemas etc.) and transportations need to be carefully considered. Hospital settings and nursing/retirement homes as well as emergency rooms, infectious diseases divisions and ambulances represent higher risk indoor environments and may require additional monitoring and specific decontamination strategies based on mechanical ventilation or air purification.","output":"The role of outdoor and indoor air quality in the spread of SARS-CoV-2: Overview and recommendations by the research group on COVID-19 and particulate matter (RESCOP commission)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Revolutionary advances in science and technology enables organisations to apply and optimise a world of visual and experiential learning in order to enhance the skills and knowledge of their employees.

In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can be targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations.

We aimed to investigate the pathogenic immunological responses operating in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed circulating inflammatory markers by immune assays and immune cell phenotyping by flow cytometry analyses and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-platelet factor (PF)4 antibody in plasma samples followed by mass spectrometry from all five patients. A thrombus was retrieved from the sinus sagittal superior of one patient and analysed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Precipitated immune complexes revealed multiple innate immune pathway triggers for platelet and leucocyte activation. Plasma contained increased levels of innate immune response cytokines and markers of systemic inflammation, extensive degranulation of neutrophils, and tissue and endothelial damage. Blood analyses showed activation of neutrophils and increased levels of circulating H3Cit, dsDNA, and myeloperoxidaseCDNA complex. The thrombus had extensive infiltration of neutrophils, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and IgG deposits.

Thereby, they enter a low-cost source of information on applicants, which potentially allows them to hire the right person on the job and avoid irresponsible employee behaviour and negligent hiring lawsuits. However, a number of ethical issues are associated with this practice, which give rise to the question of the fairness of social media screening. This article aims to provide an assessment of the procedural justice of social media screening and to articulate recommendations for a fairer use of social media in the selection process. To achieve this, a systematic literature review of research articles pertaining to social media screening has been conducted. Thereby, the benefits and ethical issues relating to social media screening, as well as recommendations for its use have been extracted and discussed against Leventhals (1980) rules of procedural justice. It turns out that without clear guidelines for recruiters, social media screening cannot be considered procedurally fair, as it opens up way too many opportunities for infringements on privacy, unfair discrimination, and adverse selection based on inaccurate information. However, it is possible to enhance the fairness of this practice by establishing clear policies and procedures to standardize the process.","output":"Social Media Screening and Procedural Justice: Towards Fairer Use of Social Media in Selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To summarize the clinical characteristics and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital(PUMCH).

Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS: In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II&#945;, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS: The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling.

A previous study found smaller stroke magnetic resonance imaging lesion growth in seronegative patients, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of these antibodies. The impact of NMDAR1-abs seropositivity on long-term functional outcome and recurrent vascular events and death after first-ever stroke remains unclear. Methods- Data from the Prospective Cohort with Incident Stroke-Berlin were used. NMDAR1-abs (ie, IgM, IgA, and IgG) were measured in serum within 7 days after first stroke. Outcomes of interest included modified Rankin Scale at one year and the time-to-event of a combined end point (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality) within 3 years. We calculated odds ratios from adjusted partial proportional odds models and subsequently compared outcome of patients with low titers (1:10; 1:32; and 1:100), and high titers (1:320; 1:1000) to seronegative patients. Furthermore, we estimated hazard ratios for a secondary vascular event or death in NMDAR1-abs seropositive compared with patients with seronegative in models adjusted for confounders. Results- The analyses included 583 patients with antibody measurements (39% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale:2, IQR:1-4), and NMDAR1-abs were observed in 76 (13%) patients. NMDAR1-abs seroprevalence was not associated with functional outcome (odds ratio=1.27; 95% CI, 0.77-2.09); sub-group analyses, however, showed worse outcome in patients with high titers (odds ratio=3.47; 95% CI, 1.54-7.80). Seropositive patients had an increased risk for a secondary vascular event or death (hazard ratios =1.83, 95% CI, 1.10-3.05). Conclusions- In our study, NMDAR1-abs seropositivity was not associated with functional outcome at one year after stroke, however, high titers (1:320) were associated with poor functional outcome. Furthermore, NMDAR1-abs seropositivity was associated with increased cardiovascular risk within 3 years after first stroke, independently from other risk factors.

Our analysis of 1063 AVC incidents revealed that COVID-19 related lockdown decreased AVC rates in suburban areas. However, in the urban area, even though traffic volume had significantly reduced, AVC did not decrease significantly, suggesting that lockdown did not influence the collision rates in the urban area.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to select target compounds from herbs for a pharmacokinetic study using network pharmacology, which could be applied in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, UPLC/Q Exactive Q-Orbitrap and GCMS 2010 were used to determine the non-volatile and volatile ingredients of TWMM. Based on the identified compounds, network pharmacology was used to screen the key compounds and targets of TWMM in the treatment of DR. Based on the compound-target-pathway network and identification of components emigrant into blood, the potential compound markers in vivo were chosen. Then, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administrated of TWMM at a 9.6 g/kg dose to investigating pharmacokinetic parameters using the UPLC-QQQ-MS. RESULTS: Ninety and forty-five compounds were identified by UPLC-MS and GC-MS, respectively. Based on the network pharmacology, nine compounds with a degree value above 15 were screened and implied that these compounds are the most active in DR treatment. Moreover, criteria of degree value greater than 7 were applied, and PTGS2, NOS2, AKT1, ESR1, TNF, and MAPK14 were inferred as the core targets in treating DR. After identification of components absorbed into blood, luteolin and formononetin were selected and used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of TWMM after its oral administration. CONCLUSIONS: The reported strategy provides a method that combines ingredient profiling, network pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to determine luteolin and formononetin as the pharmacokinetic markers of TWMM.

However, the disaster risk reduction strategy in the Saudi health care system appears to be a reactive approach focused more on flood hazards than other threats. Given the current unstable political situation in its neighboring countries and Saudi Arabia's key role in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to those affected by internal conflicts and wars, it is essential to develop a framework for training standards related to complex humanitarian disasters to provide the requisite skills and knowledge in a gradual manner, according to local context and international standards. This framework could also support the World Health Organization's (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) initiative for establishing a national disaster assistance team in Saudi Arabia. PROBLEM The main aim of this study is to provide Saudi health care providers with a competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency. METHODS The interactive, competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency was designed by five experts in disaster medicine and humanitarian relief in three stages, accordance to international standards and the local context. The course was piloted over five days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (MOI; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The 33 participants were from different health disciplines of the government sectors in-country. The participants completed the pre- and post-tests and attended three pilot workshops for disaster community awareness. RESULTS The overall knowledge scores were significantly higher in the post-test (62.9%) than the pre-test (44.2%). There were no significant differences in the pre- and post-knowledge scores for health care providers from the different government health disciplines. A 10-month, post-event survey demonstrated that participants were satisfied with their knowledge retention. Importantly, three of them (16.6%) had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice in relation to humanitarian aid response.

He was transferred to the designated hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The patient was diagnosed as a mild COVID-19 case on January 16. After medical treatment, this patient recovered and left the hospital on February 18. Viral RNA from the specimen of the patient was extracted using the QIAamp? Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instruction. Amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing approach were applied. The viral genome was reverse-transcribed and amplified using ULSEN? 2019-nCoV Whole Genome Kit (Micro Future). The sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera? XT Library Prep Kit. The final viral-enriched libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The whole genome sequence of this COVID-19 virus strain, designated SCSR-455, was assembled and obtained using Geneious v11.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com). The published genomes from GISAID and the genome of SCSR-455 were aligned with the reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1, Genbank: NC_045512, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402125) (1) using MAFFT v7.4 (2). The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was estimated with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 (3) with 1000 bootstraps and the best-fit model autodetected. The genomes of SCSR-455 had the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 8782T and 28144C which represent the Pangolin A lineage (4). The A lineage was prevalent during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (5). So far, however, it has been less frequently detected than the B lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SCSR-455 was located in the Pangolin lineage A.27 which was designated in February 2021. This lineage of COVID-19 viruses was first detected in Denmark on December 14, 2020 and then transmitted to several other countries, including Belgium, France, Netherlands, Nigeria, Rwanda, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and Turkey (Figure 1). Apart from 8782T and 28144C, viruses in the A.27 lineage had 21 SNPs (A361G, C1122T, C2509T, A9204G, A11217G, C16466T, A18366G, A20262G, C21614T, G22468T, T22917G, A23063T, C23520T, C23525T, G23948T, G25218T, T25541C, C27247T, A28273T, G28878A, and G29742A) compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. The genomes of SCSR-455 shared all these lineage-defining SNPs with the A.27 lineage strains and also had another 6 SNPs, including C3096T, C5974T, C12241T, C16293T, C19895T, and C21658T. The genomes of 4 strains of the A.27 lineage, collected in France (EPI_ISL_934974), Rwanda (EPI_ISL_1020288), and the UK (EPI_ISL_769875 and EPI_ISL_769876), respectively, shared 26 SNPs with SCSR-455. These 4 strains were phylogenetically most closely related to SCSR-455 within the A.27 lineage (Figure 1). A total of 7 amino acid mutation sites (L18F, L452R, N501Y, A653V, H655Y, D796Y, and G1219V) that correspond to the features of the A.27 lineage were detected in the spike protein of SCSR-455. The A.27 is the first sub-lineage of the A lineage that evolved to obtain N501Y mutation in the spike protein, despite the amino acid mutation D614G which might increase viral transmissibility (6) not being identified. Residue 501 is a key contact residue within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N501Y mutation has been shown to enhance binding affinity to human and murine hACE2 (7C8). N501Y has been associated with some faster-growing COVID-19 virus lineages throughout the world (e.g., the UK lineage B.1.1.7, also known as the 501Y.V1;and the South African lineage B.1.351, also known as the 501Y.V2). The A.27 lineage shared only one amino acid mutation, N501Y, with the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 lineage. In Addition, the A.27 lineage obtained the L452R mutation, which might alter the antibody recognition sites, and D796Y, which might be associated with changes in ligand binding surface. The strain SCSR-455 is the first imported A.27 lineage variant in China. Previous investigations showed that the A lineage was less prevalent than the B lineage. Given the importance of N501Y in the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, ongoing epidemiological and genomic surveillance are needed to monitor the potential expanded transmission of the A lineage. Further laboratory investigations are required to test the efficiency of the existing vaccines against this newly described A.27 lineage.","output":"The First Case of COVID-19 by an A.27 Lineage Variant Detected in a Returning Employee  Sichuan Province, China, January 7, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of COVID on surgical admissions was investigated by comparing such admissions from March to August 2020 with those in the same period in 2019.

The virus is spreading not only humans, but it is also affecting animals. First ever case of Coronavirus was registered in city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China on 31st of December in 2019. Coronavirus infected patients display very similar symptoms like pneumonia, and it attacks the respiratory organs of the body, causing difficulty in breathing. The disease is diagnosed using a Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit and requires time in the laboratory to confirm the presence of the virus. Due to insufficient availability of the kits, the suspected patients cannot be treated in time, which in turn increases the chance of spreading the disease. To overcome this solution, radiologists observed the changes appearing in the radiological images such as X-ray and CT scans. Using deep learning algorithms, the suspected patients X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) scan can differentiate between the healthy person and the patient affected by Coronavirus. In this paper, popular deep learning architectures are used to develop a Coronavirus diagnostic systems.

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I(2) value was less than 04. FINDINGS: The study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 165 [95% CI 112C244]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 219 [95% CI 122C395]), chest pain or angina (115 [105C126]), and heart failure (122 [102C145]). INTERPRETATION: Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefitCrisk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Even more so, substance use services are largely underutilized among youth, most only accessing support when in crisis. Few studies have explored young peoples help-seeking behaviours to address substance use concerns. To address this gap, this study explored how youth perceive and experience substance use services in British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: Participatory action research methods were used by partnering with BC youth (under the age of 30) from across the province who have lived and/or living experience of substance use to co-design the research protocol and materials. An initial focus group and interviews were held with 30 youth (ages 12C24) with lived and/or living experience of substance use, including alcohol, cannabis, and illicit substances. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using a data-driven approach. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified and separated by phase of service interaction, starting with: Prevention/Early intervention, where youth described feeling unworthy of support; Service accessibility, where youth encountered many barriers finding relevant substance use services and information; and Service delivery, where youth highlighted the importance of meeting them where they are at, including supporting those who have milder treatment needs and/or do not meet the diagnosis criteria of a substance use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a clear need to prioritize substance use prevention and early interventions specifically targeting youth and young adults. Youth and peers with lived and/or living experience should be involved in co-designing and co-delivering such programs to ensure their relevance and credibility among youth. The current disease model of care leaves many of the needs of this population unmet, calling for a more integrated youth-centred approach to address the multifarious concerns linked to young peoples substance use and service outcomes and experiences.","output":"A qualitative study exploring how young people perceive and experience substance use services in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents, within a multiscale framework, a search for a unified approach towards modelling the COVID-19 pandemic, from contagion to within-host dynamics.

All posts were coded inductively using thematic analysis procedures. Etons Burden of Treatment Framework and Boehmers Theory of Patient Capacity directed triangulation of themes with existing theory. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) cost barriers to care: participants describe individual and systemic cost barriers that inhibit prescribed therapy goals; (2) impact of financial cost on health: participants describe the financial effects of care on their physical and emotional health; and (3) saving strategies to overcome cost impact: participants discuss practical strategies that help them achieve therapy goals. Finally, we also identify that the use of OHCs serves to increase persons capacity with the potential to decrease treatment burden, ultimately improving mental and physical health. CONCLUSION: High cost for diabetes care generated barriers that negatively affected physical health and emotional states.

The continuous increase of MERS cases has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide, calling for development of safe and effective MERS vaccines. We have previously shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377C588 of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) fused with human Fc (S377-588-Fc) induced highly potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in the presence of MF59 adjuvant. Here we optimized the doses of S377-588-Fc using MF59 as an adjuvant in order to elicit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen. Our results showed that S377-588-Fc at 1 g was able to induce in the immunized mice potent humoral and cellular immune responses. Particularly, S377-588-Fc at 1 g elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV similar to those induced at 5 and 20 g, respectively. These results suggest that this RBD-based subunit MERS vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one g is sufficiently potent to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, against MERS-CoV infection, thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dosage of RBD-based MERS vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dose-sparing strategy in other subunit vaccine trials.","output":"Optimization of antigen dose for a receptor-binding domain-based subunit vaccine against MERS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Over the years, specialized open market approach has remained unstructured along many lines and this has affected the intervention of technical advancement in the buyer-seller relationship The consequence of this includes the inability of online markets moderators and e commerce systemdevelopers to incorporate these markets as many ecommerce platforms use predetermined structured frameworks In this paper, the researchers presented a Unified Modeling Framework as an implementable approach to restructure the non specialized open markets using proximity based techniques The approach was implemented as a web service and users feedback suggested high level of satisfaction in the defined approach 45 users were engaged in the trials and our results revealed that the approach motivated both buyers and sellers to adopt the use of mobile ecommerce platforms as an alternative market Awareness, product safety and originality are some challenges to which both buyers and sellers raised as areas of concern Many considered this approach a necessity considering the several restrictions that will emerge post COIVID19 Key Words: Open, Market, Buyer, Seller, Proximity Framework, COVID 19","output":"Redefining proximity framework in non specialized open markets using buyers location coordinates for nearest seller identification: An immediate open market response to covid 19 realities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate existing racial/ethnic inequities in preterm birth. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in very preterm birth (VPTB) and preterm birth (PTB) increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City. EXPOSURES: Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity. RESULTS: Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, ?2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, ?5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic.

However, nucleocapsid (N) protein of two arteriviruses, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus and equine arteritis virus, has been observed to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected and N-gene-transfected cells in addition to their normal cytoplasmic distribution. In the present study, the N protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice was examined for nuclear localization. The subcellular localization of LDV-N was determined by tagging N with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) at the N- and C-terminus. Both N-EGFP and EGFP-N fusion proteins localized to the nucleus and nucleolus of gene-transfected cells. Labeled N also accumulated in the perinuclear region, the site of virus replication. The LDV-N sequence contains a putative pat4-type nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of 38-KKKK. To determine its functional significance, a series of deletion constructs of N were generated and individually expressed in cells. The results showed that the pat4 NLS was essential for nuclear translocation. In addition, the LDV-N interacted with the importin- and - proteins, suggesting that the LDV-N nuclear localization may occur via the importin-mediated nuclear transport pathway.

Interactions between A. fumigatus and human blood platelets lead to intravascular thrombosis and localized infarcts. To better understand A. fumigatus pathogenesis, we aimed to analyze the genetic basis of interactions between the pathogen and blood platelets. Methods A bioinformatic pipeline on microarray gene expression dataset, including analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Limma R package and their molecular function, as well as biological pathways identification, was conducted to find the effective genes involved in IA. In the wet phase, the gene expression patterns following fungal exposure to blood platelets at 15, 30, 60, and 180 min were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. Results Three genes encoding aspartic endopeptidases including (Pep1), (Asp f 13), and (-glucanase) were the standing candidates. The invasion-promoting fungal proteinase-encoding genes were down-regulated after 30 min of hyphal incubation with blood platelets, and then up-regulated at 60 and 180 min, although only Pep1 was greater than the control at the 60and 180 min time points.

Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. RESULTS: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base.","output":"Economic Value of Data and Analytics for Health Care Providers: Hermeneutic Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been at its peak for the past 8 months and has affected more than 215 countries around the world.

Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation, the number of deaths is almost one third that of the United States and one half that of Brazil. However, there has been no experience published from non-COVID-19-designated hospitals, where the aim is to manage noninfected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. METHODS: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (nontrauma) done in the past 5 months (March-July 2020) in our institute, which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India, and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. RESULTS: We operated a total of 630 cases (nontrauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (P = 0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared with the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of rapid antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into 3 zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone, and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists.

Despite physical health consequences, COVID-19 pandemic has created stress and anxiety, as result there is an increased risk of mental illnesses both in the infected and normal individuals. To eradicate these risks, it is necessary to determine the COVID-19 zoonotic source of transmission to humans and clinical manifestations in infected individuals. Although, identification or development of the highly effective therapeutic agents is necessary, however, development of protective strategies against the COVID-19 by enhancing immune responses will be an asset in the current scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A dedicated clinical pharmacology and internal medicine team screened for contraindications, administered informed consent, maintained compliance and monitored for adverse events. RESULTS: Among the 194 HCWs screened for ruling out contraindications for prophylaxis, 9 were excluded and 185 were initiated on HCQ. A total of 55 adverse events were seen in 38 (20.5%) HCWs out of which 70.9%, 29.1% were mild and moderate & none were severe. Before the completion of therapy, a total of 23 participants discontinued. Change in QTc interval on day 2 was 5 (IQR: -3.75, 11) ms and the end of week 1 was 15 ms (IQR: 2, 18).

PDT can be applied in the settings of several malignant diseases. In fact, the earliest preclinical applications date back to 1900s. Dougherty reported the treatment of skin tumors by PDT in 1978. Several further studies around 1980 demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT. Thus, the technique has attracted the attention of numerous researchers since then. Hematoporphyrin derivative received the FDA approval as a clinical application of PDT in 1995. We have indeed witnessed a considerable progress in the field over the last century. Given the fact that PDT has a favorable adverse event profile and can enhance anti-tumor immune responses as well as demonstrating minimally invasive characteristics, it is disappointing that PDT is not broadly utilized in the clinical setting for the treatment of malignant and/or non-malignant diseases. Several issues still hinder the development of PDT, such as those related with light, tissue oxygenation and inherent properties of the photosensitizers. Various photosensitizers have been designed/synthesized in order to overcome the limitations. In this Review, we provide a general overview of the mechanisms of action in terms of PDT in cancer, including the effects on immune system and vasculature as well as mechanisms related with tumor cell destruction. We will also briefly mention the application of PDT for non-malignant diseases. The current limitations of PDT utilization in cancer will be reviewed, since identifying problems associated with design/synthesis of photosensitizers as well as application of light and tissue oxygenation might pave the way for more effective PDT approaches. Furthermore, novel promising approaches to improve outcome in PDT such as selectivity, bioengineering, subcellular/organelle targeting, etc. will also be discussed in detail, since the potential of pioneering and exceptional approaches that aim to overcome the limitations and reveal the full potential of PDT in terms of clinical translation are undoubtedly exciting. A better understanding of novel concepts in the field (e.g. enhanced, two-stage, fractional PDT) will most likely prove to be very useful for pursuing and improving effective PDT strategies.","output":"Photodynamic TherapyCurrent Limitations and Novel Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has led to an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide.

In this study, we investigated hyperglycaemia\\\\induced inflammation mediating high\\\\mobility group box 1 activation, which is involved in a novel form of cell death, pyroptosis, diabetic sarcopenia, atrophy, and adverse muscle remodelling. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone morphogenetic protein\\\\7 (BMP\\\\7), an osteoporosis drug, to treat pyroptosis, and diabetic muscle myopathy. METHODS: C57BL6 mice were treated with saline (control), streptozotocin (STZ), or STZ + BMP\\\\7 to generate diabetic muscle myopathy. Diabetes was established by determining the increased levels of glucose. Then, muscle function was examined, and animals were sacrificed. Gastrocnemius muscle or blood samples were analysed for inflammation, pyroptosis, weight loss, muscle atrophy, and adverse structural remodelling of gastrocnemius muscle using histology, enzyme\\\\linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A significant (P < 0.05) increase in hyperglycaemia leads to an increase in inflammasome (high\\\\mobility group box 1, toll\\\\like receptor\\\\4, and nucleotide\\\\binding oligomerization domain, leucine\\\\rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3) formation in diabetic muscle cells.

The data include a public bus survey from Otago School Students Lifestyle Survey (OSSLS, 1391 adolescents); the Built Environment Active Transport to School (BEATS) Study parental survey (350 parents), focus groups (54 adolescents, 25 parents, 12 teachers) and semi-structured interviews (12 principals); interviews with three policy-makers from local/regional/national agencies; and analysis of 10 relevant local/regional/national strategies/transport plans. The findings show how distance to school, cost, parental trip chaining, built environment features, the weather, convenience, and safety perceptions are major barriers to using public transport to school. Moreover, current transport planning documents do not favour public health. A number of recommendations that could increase public transport use are made including: raising parking prices to discourage parents driving and trip-chaining; improving bus infrastructure and services; providing subsidies; and changing perceptions of public transport use and users.

Instead, value is thought to be inferred through complex higher-order associations. Rodent research has demonstrated that the formation and maintenance of first-order and higher-order associations are supported by distinct neural substrates. In this study, we explored whether this pattern of findings held true for humans. Participants underwent first-order and subsequent higher-order conditioning using an aversive burst of white noise or neutral tone as the unconditioned stimuli. Four distinct tones, initially neutral, served as first-order and higher-order conditioned stimuli. Autonomic and neural responses were indexed by pupillometry and evoked response potentials (ERPs) respectively. Conditioned aversive values of first-order and higher-order stimuli led to increased autonomic responses, as indexed by pupil dilation. Distinct temporo-spatial auditory evoked response potentials were elicited by first-order and high-order conditioned stimuli. Conditioned first-order responses peaked around 260 ms and source estimation suggested a primary medial prefrontal and amygdala source. Conversely, conditioned higher-order responses peaked around 120 ms with an estimated source in the medial temporal lobe. Interestingly, pupillometry responses to first-order conditioned stimuli were diminished after higher order training, possibly signifying concomitant incidental extinction, while responses to higher-order stimuli remained. This suggests that once formed, higher order associations are at least partially independent of first order conditioned representations. This experiment demonstrates that first-order and higher-order conditioned associations have distinct neural signatures, and like rodents, the medial temporal lobe may be specifically involved with higher-order conditioning.","output":"Early Auditory Event Related Potentials Distinguish Higher-Order From First-Order Aversive Conditioning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology is advancing progressively at a very sharp rate in every phase of the commercial and economic issues, where energy plays a vital role in hi-tech enrichment.

The Cochran's Q-test and I2 statistic were applied to assess heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled estimate of the mean, and a meta-regression method was utilized to investigate the factors affecting heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS Of 1132 studies, 23 were included in the analysis (sample size: 749 for neonates and 820 for mothers). Most of these studies (n = 13) were conducted in China. The pooled estimate for the mean of birth weight, APGAR score in min 1 and 5 was 3084.97 g (95% CI: 2993.66-3176.29), 8.76 (95% CI: 8.27-9.25), and 9.44 (95% CI: 9.18-9.70), respectively.

Diseases like influenza, enteric fever and rickettsial fevers account for majority of such outbreaks. Optimal diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions are not available at the point-of-care. A proper epidemiological and clinical characterization of such outbreaks is important for appropriate treatment and control efforts. METHODS: An investigation was initiated as a response to increased presentation of patients at Patan Hospital from Chalnakhel locality in Dakchinkali municipality, Kathmandu with AUFI from June 10 to July 1, 2016. Focused group discussion with local inhabitants and the epidemiological curve of febrile patients at local primary health care centre confirmed the outbreak. The household-survey was conducted in the area with questionnaire administered on patients to characterize their illnesses and their medical records were reviewed. A different set of questionnaire was administered on the patients and controls to investigate the association with common risk factors. Water samples were collected and analyzed microbiologically. RESULTS: Eighty one patients from 137 households suffered from febrile illness within 6 weeks window before the investigation. All the 67 sampled patients with acute fever had a generalized illness without a discernible focus of infection. Only 38% of the patients had received a clinical diagnosis while the rest were treated empirically without a diagnosis. Three patients had blood culture confirmed enteric fever. Forty-two (63%) patients had been administered antibiotics, most commonly, ofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin with a mean fever clearance time of 4 days. There was no definite association between several risk factors and fever. Fecal contamination was noted in tap water samples. CONCLUSION: Based on the pattern of illness, this outbreak was most likely a mixture of self-limiting viral infections and enteric fever. This study shows that even in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and the recovery course can suggest the diagnosis and help in formulating appropriate recommendation for treatment and control.","output":"Outbreak of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Kathmandu, Nepal: clinical and epidemiological investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE Students who fail assessments are at risk of negative consequences, including emotional distress and cessation of studies. Identifying students at risk of failure before they experience difficulties may considerably improve their outcomes. METHODS Using a prospective design, we collected simple measures of engagement (formative assessment scores, compliance with routine administrative tasks, and attendance) over the first 6 weeks of Year 1. These measures were combined to form an engagement score which was used to predict a summative examination sat 14 weeks after the start of medical school. The project was repeated for five cohorts, giving a total sample size of 1042. RESULTS Simple linear regression showed engagement predicted performance (R2adj = 0.03, F(1,1040) = 90.09, p < 0.001) with a small effect size. More than half of failing students had an engagement score in the lowest two deciles. CONCLUSIONS At-risk medical students can be identified with some accuracy immediately after starting medical school using routinely collected, easily analysed data, allowing for tailored interventions to support students. The toolkit provided here can reproduce the predictive model in any equivalent educational context. Medical educationalists must evaluate how the advantages of early detection are balanced against the potential invasiveness of using student data.","output":"Predicting failure before it happens: A 5-year, 1042 participant prospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are the main causes for hospitalization in children and a common reason for the initiation of antibiotic treatment. Rapid antigen detection tests and point-of-care mPCR-based assays provide a fast detection of viral pathogens. Nonetheless, the prescription rate of antibiotics for respiratory infections is exceedingly high. In particular, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections frequently cause antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Children hospitalized in our clinic with an acute respiratory infection between January 2008 and January 2013 were included in the present study. Data of 3799 children were analyzed retrospectively for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and antibiotic and inhalation treatment. We performed an in-house m-RT-PCR-ELISA method for pathogen detection. RESULTS: Pathogen detection was possible in 2464 patients. In 6.3%, hMPV and, in 24.0%, RSV were detected. Patients positively tested for hMPV received inhalation therapy in 62.9%; patients positive for RSV in 73.8%. Patients positive for hMPV were treated with antibiotics in 62.3%. Patients with RSV infection received antibiotic treatment in 44.4%; all others in 43.5%. Notably, a positive result in RSV-RADT was associated with reduced number of antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: hMPV infections inherit a two times higher probability of antibiotic treatment. There was no significant difference in laboratory findings or body temperature between hMPV infection and infections caused by other pathogens. Clinical symptoms seem not to differ from those in RSV illness. Nonetheless, RSV infections triggered significantly lower antibiotic prescription rates. A considerate application of a POC-mPCR for patients with RSV-like symptoms and age of 1 year and older with a negative RSV-RADT might lead to higher detection rates of hMPV and a reduction in prescription of antibiotics.","output":"High antibiotic prescription rates in hospitalized children with human metapneumovirus infection in comparison to RSV infection emphasize the value of point-of-care diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies highlight synergies for families receiving early childhood literacy support from their health care provider and public library, with more reading at home and higher quality book-sharing interactions. Our primary objective was to determine the percentage of Childrens Hospital Winnipeg Ambulatory Clinics patients who had ever used a public library. The clinic has a longstanding early-childhood literacy program and serves remote communities and low-income Winnipeg families. METHODS: A structured survey was administered to parents or legal guardians by the first author. It explored library barriers and covariates that might affect library use. Analysis included descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model for predictors of library use. RESULTS: Ninety-seven nearly consecutive surveys were administered, half prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents were female, from Winnipeg, and in the two lowest neighbourhood income quintiles. Roughly half (46.4%) of children had used a library. Most respondents wanted health care providers to promote literacy and provide information about public libraries, and more supported in-clinic distribution of books. The number of children per household positively predicted library use, possibly a proxy for experience with community resources. About 2/3 of respondents believed that library fines should be abolished. Most identified other barriers, for example, inconvenient hours, distance, or concerns about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Less than half of surveyed families used public libraries, citing multiple barriers, including fines. Moreover, not all health care providers can offer new books and anticipatory guidance.

Twelve isolates carried at least one of the SE genes. Among them, five representative isolates presented transcriptional expression for at least one gene. Both sodium chloride and low temperatures interfered with the expression of the SE genes, decreasing their values. However, one isolate displayed relative expression 2.25 times higher for sed gene than S. aureus FRI 361 in optimal conditions (p < 0.05), demonstrating their toxigenic potential even under salt stress.

The degree of inconsistency and discordance reflects contradictory conclusions from independent, clinical-based studies that took roughly similar approaches, in terms of both experimental design (retrospective, observational, cohort-based, etc.) and statistical analysis workflows (propensity-score matching and stratification into sub-cohorts, etc.). The contradictions and potential confusion have ramifications for clinicians faced with choosing therapeutically optimal courses of intervention: e.g., do any potential benefits of famotidine suggest its use in a particular COVID-19 case? (If so, what administration route, dosage regimen, duration, etc. are likely optimal?) As succinctly put this March in Freedberg et al. (2021), several retrospective studies show relationships between famotidine and outcomes in COVID-19 and several do not. Beyond the pressing issue of possible therapeutic indications, the conflicting data and conclusions related to famotidine must be resolved before its inclusion/integration in ontological and knowledge graph (KG)Cbased frameworks, which in turn are useful for drug discovery and repurposing. As a broader methodological issue, note that reconciling inconsistencies would bolster the validity of meta-analyses which draw upon the relevant data-sources. And, perhaps most broadly, developing a system for treating inconsistencies would stand to improve the qualities of both 1) real world evidence-based studies (retrospective), on the one hand, and 2) placebo-controlled, randomized multi-center clinical trials (prospective), on the other hand. In other words, a systematic approach to reconciling the two types of studies would inherently improve the quality and utility of each type of study individually.","output":"A Birds-Eye (Re)View of Acid-Suppression Drugs, COVID-19, and the Highly Variable Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumothorax, as a consequence of COVID-19 infection, has become an established entity but the delayed occurrence of pneumothorax after recovery from the illness is less commonly reported.

Russia is, needless to say, among the countries affected by SARS-CoV-2, and its health authorities have mobilized significant efforts and resources to fight the disease. The paper presents the result of a functional analysis of 155 patients in the Moscow Region who were examined at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences during the first wave of the pandemic (February-July, 2020). The inclusion criteria were a positive PCR test and typical, computed tomographic findings of viral pneumonia in the form of ground-glass opacities. A clinical correlation analysis was performed in four groups of patients: (1) those who were not on mechanical ventilation, (2) those who were on mechanical ventilation, and (3) those who subsequently recovered or (4) died. The correlation analysis also considered confounding comorbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, etc.). The immunological status of the patients was examined (levels of immunoglobulins of the M, A, G classes and their subclasses, as well as the total immunoglobulin level) using an original SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA kit. The ELISA kit was developed using linear S-protein RBD-SD1 and NTD fragments, as well as the N-protein, as antigens. These antigens were produced in the prokaryotic E. coli system. Recombinant RBD produced in the eukaryotic CHO system (RBD CHO) was used as an antigen representing conformational RBD epitopes. The immunoglobulin A level was found to be the earliest serological criterion for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and it yielded the best sensitivity and diagnostic significance of ELISA compared to that of class M immunoglobulin. We demonstrated that the seroconversion rate of \\"early\\" N-protein-specific IgM and IgA antibodies is comparable to that of antibodies specific to RBD conformational epitopes. At the same time, seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific class G immunoglobulins was significantly faster compared to that of other specific antibodies. Our findings suggest that the strong immunogenicity of the RBD fragment is for the most part associated with its conformational epitopes, while the linear RBD and NTD epitopes have the least immunogenicity. An analysis of the occurrence rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins of different classes revealed that RBD- and N-specific antibodies should be evaluated in parallel to improve the sensitivity of ELISA. An analysis of the immunoglobulin subclass distribution in sera of seropositive patients revealed uniform induction of N-protein-specific IgG subclasses G1-G4 and IgA subclasses A1-A2 in groups of patients with varying severity of COVID-19. In the case of the S-protein, G1, G3, and A1 were the main subclasses of antibodies involved in the immune response.","output":"COVID-19 in Russia: Clinical and Immunological Features of the First-Wave Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020 has caused oncology teams around the world to adapt their practice in the aim of protecting patients. Early evidence from China indicated that patients with cancer, and particularly those who had recently received chemotherapy or surgery, were at increased risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many registries of cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 emerged during the first wave. We collate the evidence from these national and international studies and focus on the risk factors for patients with solid cancers and the contribution of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACTchemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormone therapy) to outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients with cancer infected with SARS-Cov-2 have a higher probability of death compared with patients without cancer. Common risk factors for mortality following COVID-19 include age, male sex, smoking history, number of comorbidities and poor performance status. Oncological features that may predict for worse outcomes include tumour stage, disease trajectory and lung cancer. Most studies did not identify an association between SACT and adverse outcomes. Recent data suggest that the timing of receipt of SACT may be associated with risk of mortality.

Epidemiological analysis of the 689 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples revealed GH and GR to be the predominant clades circulating in different states in India. The northern part of India largely reported the 'GH' clade, whereas the southern part reported the 'GR', with a few exceptions. These sequences also revealed the presence of single independent mutations-E484Q and N440K-from Maharashtra (first observed in March 2020) and Southern Indian States (first observed in May 2020), respectively.

With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In the present review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management. What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome strikes all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care. All patients need a secured airway, and most patients need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Furthermore, immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, has become an essential part of the postresuscitation treatment. Targeted temperature management with controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation is the most important neuroprotective strategy to take. Targeted temperature management should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, it should be maintained at 32 to 36C for at least 24 h, whereas rewarming should not increase more than 0.5C per hour. However, uncertainty remains regarding targeted temperature management components, warranting further research into the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and the rewarming rate. Moreover, targeted temperature management is linked to some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Circulation needs to be monitored invasively and any deviances corrected in a timely fashion. Outcome prediction in the individual patient is challenging, and a self-fulfilling prophecy poses a real threat to early prognostication based on clinical assessment alone. Therefore, delayed and multimodal prognostication is now considered a key element of postresuscitation care. Finally, modern postresuscitation care can produce good outcomes in the majority of patients but requires major diagnostic and therapeutic resources and specific training. Hence, recent international guidelines strongly recommend the implementation of regional prehospital resuscitation systems with integrated and specialized cardiac arrest centers.","output":"Postresuscitation Care after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: Clinical Update and Focus on Targeted Temperature Management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An animal model for infection with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) was evaluated in monkeys Macaca rhesus.

We aimed to develop a Simplified Telephone Assessment for Dementia risk (STAD) (a new screening tool utilizing telephonic interviews to predict dementia risk) and examine the predictive validity of the STAD for the incidence of dementia. METHODS: We developed STAD based on a combination of literature review, statistical analysis, and expert opinion. We selected 12 binary questions on subjective cognitive complaints, depressive symptoms, and lifestyle activities. In the validation study, we used STAD for 4298 community-dwelling older adults and observed the incidence of dementia during the 24-month follow-up period. The total score of STAD ranging from 0 to 12 was calculated, and the cut-off point for dementia incidence was determined using the Youden index. The survival rate of dementia incidence according to the cut-off points was determined. Furthermore, we used a decision-tree model (classification and regression tree, CART) to enhance the predictive ability of STAD for dementia risk screening. RESULTS: The cut-off point of STAD was set at 4/5. Participants scoring  5 points showed a significantly higher risk of dementia than those scoring  4 points, even after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.67 [1.40C5.08]). A decision tree model using the CART algorithm was constructed using 12 nodes with three STAD items. It showed better performance for dementia prediction in terms of accuracy and specificity as compared to the logistic regression model, although its sensitivity was worse than the logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a 12-item questionnaire, STAD, as a screening tool to predict dementia risk utilizing telephonic interviews and confirmed its predictive validity. Our findings might provide useful information for early screening of dementia risk and enable bridging between community and clinical settings. Additionally, STAD could be employed without face-to-face meetings in a short time; therefore, it may be a suitable screening tool for community-dwelling older adults who have negative attitudes toward clinical examination or are non-adherent to follow-up assessments in clinical trials.

An assessment of genetic and epigenetic alterations by a modified comet assay showed elevated levels of oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA hypermethylation in BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice used as a model of autism. Oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA methylation were further quantified fluorometrically, and the results showed similar changes. Conversely, 3-AB treated BTBR mice showed a significant reduction in these alterations compared with untreated mice. The expressions of 43 genes involved in DNA repair were altered in BTBR mice.

Recombination produces RNA populations distinct from full-length gene segments and can influence viral population dynamics, persistence, and host immune responses. Viruses in the Reoviridae family, including rotavirus and mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), have been reported to package segments containing rearrangements or internal deletions. Rotaviruses with RNA segments containing rearrangements have been isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent children and in vitro following serial passage at relatively high multiplicity. Reoviruses that package small, defective RNA segments have established chronic infections in cells and in mice. However, the mechanism and extent of Reoviridae RNA recombination are undefined. Towards filling this gap in knowledge, we determined the titers and RNA segment profiles for reovirus and rotavirus following serial passage in cultured cells. The viruses exhibited occasional titer reductions characteristic of interference. Reovirus strains frequently accumulated segments that retained 5' and 3' terminal sequences and featured large internal deletions, while similarly fragmented segments were rarely detected in rotavirus populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing to analyze RNA molecules packaged in purified reovirus particles, we identified distinct recombination sites within individual viral genome segments. Recombination junctions were frequently but not always characterized by short direct sequence repeats upstream and downstream that spanned junction sites. Taken together, these findings suggest that reovirus accumulates defective gene segments featuring internal deletions during passage and undergoes sequence-directed recombination at distinct sites.IMPORTANCE Viruses in the Reoviridae family include important pathogens of humans and other animals and have segmented RNA genomes. Recombination in RNA virus populations can facilitate novel host exploration and increased disease severity. The extent, patterns, and mechanisms of Reoviridae recombination and the functions and effects of recombined RNA products are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that mammalian orthoreovirus regularly synthesizes RNA recombination products that retain terminal sequences but contain internal deletions, while rotavirus rarely synthesizes such products. Recombination occurs more frequently at specific sites in the mammalian orthoreovirus genome, and short regions of identical sequence are often detected at junction sites. These findings suggest that mammalian orthoreovirus recombination events are directed in part by RNA sequences. An improved understanding of recombined viral RNA synthesis may enhance our capacity to engineer improved vaccines and virotherapies in the future.","output":"Reovirus RNA recombination is sequence directed and generates internally deleted defective genome segments during passage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Color constancy is our ability to perceive constant colors across varying illuminations.

STUDY DESIGN Using a cohort Markov model, we modeled the costs and effectiveness of mesh prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis at the index operation in a cohort of 60-year-old patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer during a time horizon of 5 years. Costs were expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars (CAD$) and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS In patients with stage I to III rectal cancer, prophylactic mesh was dominant (less costly and more effective) compared with no mesh.

METHODS: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Reunion Island during the austral winter 2009 (weeks 30C44) that allowed identification of 125 households with at least one member who developed symptoms of Influenza-like illness (ILI). Three consecutive nasal swabs were collected from each household member (443 individuals) on day 0, 3 and 8 post-ILI report and tested for pH1N1 and 15 NIRVs by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Two successive waves of viral infections were identified: a first wave (W33C37) when pH1N1 was dominant and co-circulated with NIRVs, sharply interrupted by a second wave (W38C44), almost exclusively composed of NIRVs, mainly human Rhinoviruses (hRV) and Coronaviruses (hCoV). Data suggest that some interference may occur between NIRVs and pH1N1 when they co-circulate within the same household, where NIRVs were more likely to infect pH1N1 negative individuals than pH1N1 positive peers (relative risk: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.80C5.46, P<0.001). Viral shedding was significantly shorter (P = 0.035) in patients who were co-infected by pH1N1 and NIRV or by two different NIRVs compared to those who were infected with only one virus, whatever this virus was (pH1N1 or NIRVs). Although intense co-circulation of NIRVs (especially hRV) likely brought pH1N1 under the detection threshold, it did not prevent spread of the pandemic Influenza virus within the susceptible population nor induction of an extensive herd immunity to it. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that NIRV co-infections during Influenza epidemics may act as cofactors that contribute to shape an outbreak and modulate the attack rate. They further warrant broad spectrum studies to fully understand viral epidemics.","output":"Intense Co-Circulation of Non-Influenza Respiratory Viruses during the First Wave of Pandemic Influenza pH1N1/2009: A Cohort Study in Reunion Island"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this ongoing SARS-CoV2 Corona virus pandemic, we are witnessing an uninhibited spread of mis-information on various social media platforms.

In addition to the anti-corrosion performance, mechanical properties and morphologies of the composites are analyzed. Various parameters indicating the anti-corrosion performance illustrate that smaller size of GnP in the composites shows higher anti-corrosion performance on copper substrate. The results show that the smaller size of GnP is not only uniformly dispersed within PU, but also offers a high surface area which helps construct an efficient filler pathway that suppresses the diffusion of a corrosive agent into the polymer matrix. Nevertheless, mechanical properties of the composites are partially improved.

We aimed to identify the critical predictors that can effectively assess the disease conditions of patients with COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS All consecutive patients (n = 294) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the PLA from February 6 to February 21, 2020, were enrolled. These patients were divided into the severe group and the nonsevere group according to disease severity during hospitalization. RESULTS The median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value of the severe patients was dramatically higher than that of the nonsevere patients (10.4 vs 2.6; P < .001). The NLR value equal to 5 was a boundary value worthy of reference, because more than 80% severe patients had an NLR value greater than 5 and over 80% nonsevere patients had an NLR value less than 5. The NLR value of these COVID-19 patients was positively and respectively correlated with the values of C-reactive protein (R = .5921, P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (R = .4509, P < .001), procalcitonin (R = .5504, P < .001), fibrinogen (R = .4710, P < .001), and D-dimers (R = .4425, P < .001).

METHODS: Two paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results were stratified on the basis of gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold. RESULTS: Out of the 512 participants, aged 0C90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-min nasal swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swab had 97.5% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity, within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity. All (100%) samples detected within 33 rt-PCR cycles were also identified using the antigen test. Results were consistent across age and gender. The user error rate of the test system when used by minimally trained operators was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1C3.7%).

DESIGN: Baseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: Adults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials cohort from general practitioner practices in North West London were invited to participate from April to July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 6219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50C92 years completed the survey.

We retrospectively investigated the effect of ABO incompatibility on the clinical outcomes and changes of isoagglutinin titres of 261 consecutive patients who underwent CBT in a single centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied patients with haematological malignancies undergoing unrelated CBT following myeloablative conditioning. There were 80 matched, 72 major mismatched, 72 minor mismatched, and 37 bidirectional mismatched transplants. Risk factors that could potentially influence the patients' outcomes were evaluated. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isohaemagglutinin antibody (IHA) titres were determined 1 day before and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the transplant. RESULTS: ABO mismatches did not influence engraftment, transfusion requirements, event-free survival or overall survival following CBT. The anti-donor IgM serum IHA titres fell to &#8804;1:8 at week 8 after CBT in all patients with ABO major and bidirectional mismatches. The percentages of patients requiring platelet and red blood cell transfusions in the period 31-61 days after CBT were markedly lower than in the period 0-30 days after CBT, being 15% vs 99% for platelets and 23% vs 78% for red blood cells, respectively. Of the 69 recipients of minor mismatched CBT tested, only three with AB blood type developed low titres of anti-recipient IHA after 5 months. DISCUSSION: In this study ABO incompatibility did not affect clinical outcomes after CBT. A higher number of CD34+ cells infused was correlated with earlier engraftment. Severe acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with poor overall survival. As the IHA titre decreased, so did the number of patients requiring blood transfusion. Rapidly decreasing anti-donor IHA titres and the non-production of donor anti-recipient A and/or B antibodies might contribute to a good outcome of ABO-incompatible CBT with myeloablative conditioning for haematological malignancies.","output":"ABO incompatibility does not affect transfusion requirements or clinical outcomes of unrelated cord blood transplantation after myeloablative conditioning for haematological malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cet article traite de lvolution des dcisions de justice sur lobligation de scurit de lemployeur de 2000  2020.

The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies. CONCLUSIONOur comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

Given the typically observed obesity paradox among patients on kidney function replacement therapy (KFRT), especially dialysis patients, we examined the association of obesity with mortality among dialysis patients or living with a kidney transplant with COVID-19. METHODS: Data from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) were used. KFRT-patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 1(st), 2020, and January 31(st), 2021 were included. The association of Quetelet's body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)), divided into: <18.5 (lean), 18.5-24.9 (normal weight), 25-29.9 (overweight), 30-34.9 (obese I) and 35 (obese II/III), with 3-month mortality was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: In 3,160 patients on KFRT (mean age:65 years, male:61%), 99 patients were lean, 1,151 normal weight (reference), 1,160 overweight, 525 obese I, and 225 obese II/III. During follow-up of 3 months, 28%, 20%, 21%, 23%, and 27% of patients died in these categories, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, the HRs for 3-month mortality were 1.65 (95%CI:1.10,2.47), 1 (ref.), 1.07 (95%CI:0.89,1.28), 1.17 (95%CI:0.93,1.46) and 1.71 (95%CI:1.27,2.30), respectively. Results were similar among dialysis patients (N = 2,343) and among those living with a kidney transplant (N = 817) (p(interaction) = 0.99), but differed by sex (p(interaction) = 0.019). In males, the HRs for the association of aforementioned BMI categories with 3-month mortality were 2.07 (95% CI:1.22, 3.52), 1 (Ref.), 0.97 (95% CI: 0.78. 1.21), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.33) and 1.22 (95%CI:0.78, 1.91) respectively, and in females corresponding HRs were 1.34 (95% CI: 0.70, 2.57), 1 (Ref.), 1.31 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.85), 1.54 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.26) and 2.49 (95%CI:1.62, 3.84) respectively.. CONCLUSION: In KFRT-patients with COVID-19, on dialysis or a kidney transplant, obesity is associated with an increased risk of mortality at 3 months. This is in contrast to the obesity paradox generally observed in dialysis patients. Additional studies are required to corroborate the sex difference in the association of obesity with mortality.","output":"Association of obesity with 3-month mortality in kidney failure patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID pandemic has brought a spectacular prominence to the role of digital technologies in public health. However, the policy discourse about digital technology has been for the most part strikingly narrow. Even as there is a discussion of the impact of particular digital tools, there is relatively little deliberation on the broader issues of how these technologies are reconstituting core aspects of health systems and polities. How did we get to a narrow debate on a vast topic? One way to understand this irony is by turning to the history of an older technology, namely agricultural biotechnology. This article focuses on two dominant framings that significantly narrowed the debates on agricultural biotechnology: first, a narrative that had a relentless focus on agricultural biotechnology as a neatly delineated field that produced stable products, and second, the ascent of a language of ethics that elided structural explanations and addressed only downstream impacts. The brief foray into the early years of agricultural biotechnology is useful in understanding contemporary politics of digital technology.","output":"The Too\\\\Narrow Policy Debate: Lessons from Agricultural Biotechnology for Digital Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND More than forty million people suffer from depression in India. A lack of awareness, stigma related to mental health issues, and limited accessibility to treatment services magnify the profound personal and societal impact of depression. Given the rise of smartphones in India, mobile technology can help alleviate some of these depression-related challenges. AIMS AND METHOD The aim of this paper is to investigate the essential features of an India targeted depression smartphone app. We conducted an online survey to profile the needs of individuals with depression in India, which varied based on variables such as socioeconomic background, age, level of awareness toward depression, and the extent of exposure to mental health stigma. We also conducted a systematic evaluation of depression apps currently available to Indian users to investigate the user needs that these apps met and the needs that they failed to meet. Based on our findings, we made a set of recommendations related to the essential features of a future app targeted at managing depression in India. RESULTS Presently available depression apps fall short in providing some significant features such as local language options, content in audio and video formats, and user location matched resources. These gaps make these apps less than fully relevant to a diverse set of Indian users. CONCLUSIONS It is essential to provide depression-related information in a targeted manner depending upon each user's particular needs and context. Potential customizations, such as offering content in local languages and flexible formats (e.g. audio, video, and text); and providing user-relevant diagnostic tools and location matched treatment resources can help improve the suitability of the app for diverse users.","output":"Managing depression in India: Opportunities for a targeted smartphone app."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to determine the trajectories of physical activity and depressive symptoms and their reciprocal relationship among community-dwelling older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The study population consisted of a cohort of 511 participants aged 60 years and over, who were recruited from eight community health centers in Ya'an, China. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and the Patient Health Questionnaire were respectively used to measure physical activity and depressive symptoms at three time points: before the COVID-19 outbreak (T(0)), during the outbreak period (T(1)), and after the subsidence of COVID-19 (T(2)). The results revealed that physical activity and depressive symptoms fluctuated substantially across T(0), T(1), and T(2). In addition, more severe depressive symptoms at T(0) and T(1) were significantly associated with lower levels of physical activity at T(1) and T(2), but the obverse direction of physical activity being associated with subsequent depressive symptoms was not observed in the current study. These findings highlight the importance of supporting old people to remain physically active and combat mental distress early in a pandemic, and prevention and management of depressive symptoms may also be beneficial to promote physical activity.","output":"Physical activity and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic era: A three-wave cross-lagged study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large surveys indicate that many people perceive that their health behaviors (i.e., eating behaviors, physical activity, and self-care routines) and body image have changed during COVID-19; however, large individual variation exists. A persons cognitive appraisal of COVID-19 disruptions may help account for individual differences. Those with a negative problem orientation perceive problems as threats, whereas those with a positive problem orientation reframe problems as opportunities. The present experimental study examined the impact of appraisals, specifically being prompted to reflect on the changes in health routines precipitated by COVID-19 restrictions as either threats or opportunities, on problem orientation, coping behaviours, body image, and perceptions of eating behaviors and physical activity in a sample of female undergraduate students (N = 363). The group that reflected on challenges/barriers reported having a more negative problem orientation, being more negatively impacted by COVID-19, engaging in more maladaptive coping behaviors, and having less positive body image compared to participants who reflected on opportunities presented during the pandemic. Findings suggest that appraisals and problem orientation are malleable, and that people who tend to fixate on the challenges associated with COVID-19 may benefit from strategically reflecting on their own resilience and new opportunities that have arisen for engaging in health behaviors.","output":"Coping during COVID-19: The Impact of Cognitive Appraisal on Problem Orientation, Coping Behaviors, Body Image, and Perceptions of Eating Behaviors and Physical Activity during the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 5th, Guatemala declared a State of Calamity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and strict lockdown measures were initiated. The psychological consequences of these measures are yet to be fully understood. There is limited research on the psychological impact of the virus in the general population, and even less focused on Latin America and high-risk communities characterized by poverty, limited mental health resources, and high rates of stigma around mental illness. The goal of this study is to examine the psychological impact of COVID-19 across several highly vulnerable districts in Guatemala. METHODS: A semi-structured phone interview was conducted of 295 individuals in multiple districts in Guatemala City to assess self-perceived mental health consequences related to the pandemic. Sociodemographic, medical, and mental health data were collected. Chisquares and t-tests used for categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, to describe the sample. Binary logistic regressions were estimated to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics and mental health symptoms (anxiety, stress, depression, burnout, escalation of pre-existing mental health symptoms, and a sense of safety). RESULTS: The results indicate high levels of anxiety and stress in all target communities. Significant differences based on gender, age, and the number of children in the household were identified: women and older adults experience higher rates of stress and anxiety associated with the pandemic; while families with greater number of children experience higher levels of burnout. CONCLUSION: Contextualizing the current pandemic as a complex emergency can help inform further studies focusing on socioeconomic challenges and higher vulnerabilities as preconditions affecting the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Given the limited available resources for mental health care in Guatemala, informal networks of care may play an important role in meeting the needs of those individuals experiencing increased psychological distress resulting from the pandemic.","output":"The current pandemic, a complex emergency?

In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management.

An epidemiological investigation of the causative agent, which was of a highly infective nature, was conducted. METHODS: Throat swabs were carried out and a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to identify possible causative factors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients who had febrile illness during the study period was 20.24 years. The multiplex RT-PCR assay identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the causative agent. The main symptoms were sore throat (76.0%), sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%), and rhinorrhea (55.9%). The mean temperature was 38.75C and the attack rate among the recruits was 15.7% (588 out of 3750 recruits), while the mean duration of fever was 2.3 days. The prognosis was generally favorable with supportive care but recurrent fever occurred in 10.1% of the patients within a month.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of ventilation in adult human-sized swine using an ECFC and a regular ICU ventilator. DESIGN A prospective animal study. SETTING Experimental, Trauma Transplant Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. ANIMALS Eight adult Yorkshire swine, weighing 45 to 50 kg, were studied. INTERVENTIONS To create the ECFC, a 5 cm long latex cuff was placed over the distal side ports of either a 14 or 19-Fr gauge endotracheal catheter and a 1 cm long piece of plastic tube was inserted into the tip of the endotracheal catheter to create an internal resistance. The ECFC was placed into the trachea and the proximal end of the ECFC was connected to an ICU ventilator in pressure-control mode, with peak pressures set at either 25, 50 or 70 cmH2O. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tidal volume was calculated using plethysmography. RESULTS During pressure control ventilation with the 14-Fr gauge ECFC at set inspiratory pressures of 25, 50 and 75 cmH2O, the tidal volumes generated were 209  36, 309  61 and 367  85 ml, respectively, and with the 19-Fr gauge ECFC these were 277  51, 442  91 and 538  123 ml, respectively.

On 4th October 2021 European Medicines Agency approved administration of a booster dose in at least 6 months after the second dose for people aged 18 years and older. Objectives In the present study we compare the anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgA antibody responses post complete vaccination, 7 months later and after the 3rd (booster) dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine in healthy adults. Study design The levels of vaccine IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed in serum samples obtained from individuals vaccinated with two doses and a booster of BNT162b2 vaccine. Samples were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RCB) IgG and IgA semi-quantitative commercial ELISA assay. Results The geometric mean of the anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgA antibody level 7 months after vaccination of 90 healthy adults with BNT162B2 vaccine decreased significantly from 12.0 to 5.4 and 5.6 to 2.3, respectively. After the third dose of the same vaccine, the antibody level increased again, to values higher than at the beginning after the second dose. Conclusions Significant decrease of antibody levels within a few months after full vaccination could result in the higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially when new variants of the virus emerge. The booster could be crucial for protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Furthermore, early reports suggest faecal microbial transfer may have therapeutic potential, converting ICI nonresponders to responders. So far, identification of specific responsible bacterial taxa has been inconsistent between published studies, which limits future application. By culturing and metagenomic sequencing of stool sample bacteria, our group has identified a unique microbiome signature, which appears to be predictive of response to ICIs across all key published series as well as our own melanoma patient series (Robinson M et al, J Immunother Cancer 2020;8(suppl 3):A404). Because the patient numbers in all published series remain low, we are now further exploring and validating this microbiome signature in a larger scale study across several different cancer types.

Animal models are essential to fast track new interventions and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of other infectious diseases have proven extremely valuable. Here we compare SARS-CoV-2 infection in three species of experimentally infected NHPs (rhesus macaques, baboons, and marmosets). During the first 3 days, macaques developed clinical signatures of viral infection and systemic inflammation, coupled with early evidence of viral replication and mild-to-moderate interstitial and alveolar pneumonitis, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies. Cone-beam CT scans showed evidence of moderate pneumonia, which progressed over 3 days. Longitudinal studies showed that while both young and old macaques developed early signs of COVID-19, both groups recovered within a two-week period. Recovery was characterized by low-levels of viral persistence in the lung, suggesting mechanisms by which individuals with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to prolonged and progressive COVID-19. The lung compartment contained a complex early inflammatory milieu with an influx of innate and adaptive immune cells, particularly interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a prominent Type I-interferon response. While macaques developed moderate disease, baboons exhibited prolonged shedding of virus and extensive pathology following infection; and marmosets demonstrated a milder form of infection. These results showcase in critical detail, the robust early cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are not sterilizing and likely impact development of antibody responses.

Both ectodomains are highly antigenic, carry neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes, and are involved in virus-mediated fusion activity. However, data have so far been biologically based, and derived solely from T cell line-adapted (TCLA), B clade viruses. Here we have carried out sequence and theoretically based structural analyses of 357 gp41 C-terminal sequences of mainly primary isolates of HIV-1 clades A, B, C, and D. Data show that all these viruses have the potential to form a tail loop structure (the minor ectodomain) supported by three, -sheet, membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). This means that the first (N-terminal) tyrosine-based sorting signal of the gp41 tail is situated outside the cell membrane and is non-functional, and that gp41 that reaches the cell surface may be recycled back into the cytoplasm through the activity of the second tyrosine-sorting signal. However, we suggest that only a minority of cell-associated gp41 molecules C those destined for incorporation into virions C has 3 MSDs and the minor ectodomain. Most intracellular gp41 has the conventional single MSD, no minor ectodomain, a functional first tyrosine-based sorting signal, and in line with current thinking is degraded intracellularly.

As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the forefront in the development of risk communication strategies. The WHO introduced a range of activities with the purpose of enabling the public to avail verified and timely information on COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Given the various WHO activities to protect the public health during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the extent of familiarity and uptake of the WHO recommendations among the public during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: To do this, we conducted a large-scale Pan-European survey covering around 7500 individuals that are representative of populations from seven European countries, collected online during April 2-April 15, 2020. We use descriptive statistics including proportions and correlations and graphical representations such as bar charts to analyze and display the data. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that information from the WHO in the context of COVID-19 is well trusted and acted upon by the public. Overall familiarity and adherence were quite high in most countries. Adherence was higher for social distancing recommendations compared to hygiene measures. Familiarity and adherence were higher among older, female, and highly educated respondents. However, country level heterogeneities were observed in the level of trust in information from the WHO, with countries severely affected by the pandemic reporting lower levels of trust.

The SWCNHs-based sensors have shown high sensitivity, rapid response, and excellent stability, which are mainly attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity, large electrochemical window, large specific surface area, and mechanical strength of SWCNHs. In this review, we systematically summarizes the structures, synthesis methods, and sensing applications of SWCNHs, including electrochemical sensors, photoelectrochemical sensors, electrochemiluminescence sensors, fluorescent sensors, and resistive sensors. Moreover, the development prospects of SWCNHs in this field are also discussed.","output":"Structure, synthesis, and sensing applications of single-walled carbon nanohorns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Total Healthcare Expenditure (THE) has increased substantially in all countries. Since the health system reform and health policy environment differ from each country, it is necessary to analyze the motivations of THE in a specific country. METHODS: The objective of this study was to analyze the influential factors of Provincial THE (PTHE) per capita in China by using spatiotemporal panel data across 31 provinces (including provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, all called provinces in here) from 2009 to 2016 at the provincial and annual level. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to identify the influential factors of PTHE per capita. RESULTS: The number of beds per 10,000 population explained most of the variation of PTHE per capita. The results also showed that health expenditure in China reacts more to mortality compared with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. But mortality and Out-Of-Pocket Payments (OOP) as a percentage of THE were associated with PTHE per capita negatively. The rate of infectious diseases and THE as a percentage of GDP had no statistical significance. And the Proportion of the Population Aged 65 and Over (POP65) impact PTHE per capita positively. But the coefficient was small. CONCLUSIONS: In response to these findings, we conclude that the impact of the increasing percentage of OOP in THE diminishes the PTHE. Furthermore, we find that both the \\"baseline\\" health level and health provision are positively correlated with PTHE, which outweighs the effect of GDP.","output":"Study of influential factors of provincial health expenditure -analysis of panel data after the 2009 healthcare reform in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) has been detrimental to human health, economy, and wellbeing. Little information is known on the epidemiology and outcome of the disease in a localized community within Iraq. We carried out an audit of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Kirkuk General Hospital. Data from the 20th of June to the 31st of July, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Suspected COVID-19 cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data on clinical symptoms, age, and treatment protocols were analyzed concerning the outcome. Our study included a total of 200 individual confirmed COVID-19 patients. The majority of cases 55% (n = 110) displayed severe symptoms, while 32.5% (65 cases) and 12.5% (25 cases) of patients displayed moderate to mild symptoms, respectively. The rate of death in the referred patients was 5%. Most patients admitted to the hospital for treatment recovered and were discharged from the hospital within 5 to 30 days post-diagnosis. Statistical analysis revealed that patients treated with oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin in combination with vitamins C and D have shorter hospital stay compared to patients receiving the same therapeutic protocol in combination with steroids. Moreover, a higher mortality rate (4.5%) was observed in patients treated with oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, ceftriaxone, and steroids.

The pace of grain and oilseed exports in Canada and ethanol demand in the east were affected by COVID\\\\19, but the forecast of a near normal 2020 was relatively accurate. Production and prices stayed on track, largely because the world did not impose significant new barriers to trade in cereals and oilseeds and because these sectors have distanced labor in virtually every step of the supply chain which protected these markets from this pandemic. The dominant price factor for the sector remains global demand that had been growing before 2020 relative to the pace of production and may have been stimulated by deficit budgets around the world. Compared to the tight global stocks, COVID\\\\19 had a minor impact on grain prices which led to steady production worldwide and in Canada. We are still waiting for more evidence to assess the role of federal coordination in the success of the grains and oilseed sector in 2020, but Canada's past participation in trade and safety protocols based on science allowed the grains and oilseed sector in Canada to earn a very good income in 2020.","output":"The impact of COVID\\\\19 on the grains and oilseeds sector: 12 months later"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging diseases may spread rapidly through dense and large urban contact networks, especially they are transmitted by the airborne route, before new vaccines can be made available. Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city.","output":"Building Ventilation as an Effective Disease Intervention Strategy in a Dense Indoor Contact Network in an Ideal City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are representative, of which etiology is known in all human diseases However, many enigmas persist in relation to COVID-19, including different clinical phenotypes and incubation periods across individuals, species-specificity, appearance of cytokine storm and lymphopenia, and the mechanism of damage to organ cells Current immunological concepts have limitations to explain these unsolved issues Meanwhile, results of clinical, pathological, and animal studies have suggested that the virus itself is not a direct cause of acute injury to the lung or other organ cells For better understanding of COVID-19, a presumed immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented under the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis;every disease, including COVID-19, has associated etiological substances, and the host immune system controls these diverse substances according to the size and biochemical property These etiological substances, inducing inflammation and subsequent tissue injury, are smaller substances derived from virus-infected cells Initially acting nonspecific adaptive immune reaction with cytokine imbalance may be responsible for target cell injury Furthermore, substances from initial target cell injury and secondary bacterial invasion can induce further inflammation if released from local or systemic circulation COVID-19 patients with pneumonia show hypercytokinemia with lymphocytopenia corresponding to the severity of pneumonia at early stages Thus, early immune-modulator treatment, including corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, has an immunological rationale It could help reduce the morbidity and possibly mortality of older patients with underlying conditions","output":"The solution on enigmas in COVID-19: the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19, certain means were proposed to improve crowd management in the Birmingham New Street railway station. To validate the current system of crowd management in the station, this paper examines the rail passenger flow in the concourse of the Birmingham New Street railway station and the passenger interactions and queueing phenomena associated with it, mainly at the ticket machines, offices and gates, prior to and during the implementation of COVID-19 measures. The passenger behaviour in the concourse of the station was simulated using the SIMUL8 event-based simulation modelling package. Three different scenarios were modelled to analyse the changes and impacts from pre-COVID-19 and within the COVID-19 context. The results revealed that passenger behaviour in railway stations is changing due to COVID-19. Specifically, passengers are more likely to buy tickets using their smartphones or online prior to or whilst entering the station so that they can go through the station concourse with minimal queuing times and avoid contact with a facility of common use at the station, whereas those without tickets are more likely to be in a queue to buy their tickets in the station. For pre-COVID, the results showed that even with a reduced number of ticket machines, overcrowding inside the station was unlikely to occur, as 80% of all passengers in the simulation completed service within a 15-minute time frame. However, during implementation of COVID-19 measures, as the number of passengers using the station dropped significantly and more passengers bought their tickets using their smartphones and/or online, queueing times were also shorter, and thus passengers spent less time in the system. The simulation results were in accordance with the expected practice;hence the effectiveness of the simulation model was verified. Overall, as a result of this study, the following suggestions to improve crowd management in a railway passenger station concourse are proposed: encourage passengers to purchase tickets on their smartphones, remove ticket gates and replace them with sensors, and provide a one-way passenger flow system in the main concourse of the station.","output":"Analysis of Rail Passenger Flow in a Rail Station Concourse Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Event-Based Simulation Models and Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is well documented.

DESIGN Case series of consecutive veterans with SCI treated at a single center. SETTING SCI Unit at an urban Veterans Administration hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. PARTICIPANTS Seven SCI veterans with confirmed COVID-19 infection by PCR; all veterans were male, mean age was 60.6. Five had cervical level of injury, and five had complete injury (AIS A). Six veterans had a BMI > 22; three had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; three had chronic kidney disease. INTERVENTIONS None. OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of co-morbidities, diagnostic values, and clinical findings. RESULTS Each case presented differently; the most common presenting sign was fever. In the three individuals with critical and fatal infection, pre-existing comorbidities were more common and inflammatory markers were markedly elevated. CONCLUSION Level and completeness of SCI did not appear to correlate with COVID-19 severity, as mild and asymptomatic illness was noted in persons with high grade SCI. As has been shown to be the case in the general population, pre-existing comorbidities are the most reliable predictors of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection currently available for persons with chronic SCI. Contrary to concerns that SCI may mask the cardinal signs of COVID-19, such as fever and cough, by way of compromised thermoregulation and thoracoabdominal musculature, such signs were common in our series. To facilitate early detection, prompt treatment, and minimized viral spread, the implementation of preventive strategies by SCI units is recommended.","output":"COVID-19 in spinal cord injury patients at a veterans administration hospital: A case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent and young patients with chronic diseases is likely to be multi-factorial, and influenced by various aspects, such as age, sex, education, ethnicity, as well as disease control or personal coping strategies. Adolescents and young adults are at a time in their live when disruption in their education and social life, as well as uncertainty related to professional prospects and long-term disease outcomes are all associated with significant personal concerns. The aim of this survey was to assess the main determinants of COVID-19 associated concern in adolescent and young adults with JSLE and JDM as well as their well-being and resilience. Methods Questionnaires comprising of questions related to patient and disease characteristics, wellbeing, resilience and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic were disseminated through hospital contacts and patient charities social media platforms. Participation was voluntary and implied consent. The preliminary results of this ongoing survey have been analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression (R). Results The main patient and disease characteristics, self-reported well-being, resilience and perceived concern about the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in comparison in male vs. female patients. Linear regression showed that the strongest determinant of COVID-19 concern was self-reported disease activity (p < 0.0003). The self-reported disease activity was associated with the COVID-19 concern level in both female (P = 0.003) and male patients (p = 0.004) and also with disease duration in males (P = 0.018). The COVID concern was not affected by any other factors such as, employment, education, well-being or resilience. Conclusion The preliminary analysis of our survey showed that patient-reported COVID-19 concern during the pandemic was strongly determined by the self-reported disease activity irrespective of patients sex, despite significantly increased concern in the female compared to male patients, and association with disease duration in male patients only.

Participants were 143 women, aged 17C73 years (M = 25.85, SD = 8.12), recruited during a COVID-19 lockdown in Canada from May-June 2020. Participants completed self-report questionnaires on their eating, body image, and social media habits during the pandemic. The Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ) assessed symptoms of orthorexia nervosa. Compared to the period prior to lockdown, women with higher total orthorexia nervosa scores reported eating a lot more than usual, feeling greater pressure to diet and lose weight, thinking about food more often than usual, experiencing greater weight gain, and perceiving more pressure from social media specifically to lose weight and to exercise, compared to their healthy counterparts. We examined associations between individual EHQ subscales and perceived changes to eating and weight. Women who scored high on EHQ-Problems reported seeing more weight loss content on their social media than those who reported fewer orthorexia nervosa symptoms. Conversely, those who scored low on EHQ-Feelings reported feeling a lot less pressure to lose weight, somewhat less or a lot less pressure to lose weight or to exercise from social media specifically, and trended toward less laxative use during lockdown, compared to those who scored higher on orthorexia nervosa.

METHODS: Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose &#8805;10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively).

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 L capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection.

Despite performing various methods for preventing postoperative recurrence, it remains relatively high. Although considering the margin distance of bullectomy is important, no argument has been discussed for the optical margin distance until now. Hence, we evaluated the optimal margin distance for bullectomy of spontaneous pneumothorax, bullectomy to reduce postoperative recurrence. Methods Between March 2015 and May 2018, 91 eligible candidates from 142 cases, who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic bullectomy for spontaneous pneumothorax, bullectomy, were evaluated. We analysed the factors preventing postoperative recurrence, including the margin distance using the inverse-probability of treatment weighted method by propensity score was used to adjust for heterogeneous patient backgrounds. Results The patients' median age was 20 years (range, 14-86 years). Postoperative recurrences occurred in 8 cases (8.8%). The margin distance was 9.15.0 mm. The cut-off point of the margin distance was defined as 5.0 mm. The inverse-probability of treatment weighted method indicated that a margin distance 5.0 mm significantly prevented postoperative recurrence (P=0.0076, hazard ratio =0.18).

We recently encountered this in the management of 2 patients with effort-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and offer a treatment paradigm for consideration. CASE REPORTS A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSION The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.","output":"Surgical Considerations in the Treatment of Axillary-Subclavian Venous Thrombosis in the Era of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The survival of mankind cannot be imagined without air. Consistent developments in almost all realms of modern human society affected the health of the air adversely. Daily industrial, transport, and domestic activities are stirring hazardous pollutants in our environment. Monitoring and predicting air quality have become essentially important in this era, especially in developing countries like India. In contrast to the traditional methods, the prediction technologies based on machine learning techniques are proved to be the most efficient tools to study such modern hazards. The present work investigates six years of air pollution data from 23 Indian cities for air quality analysis and prediction. The dataset is well preprocessed and key features are selected through the correlation analysis. An exploratory data analysis is exercised to develop insights into various hidden patterns in the dataset and pollutants directly affecting the air quality index are identified. A significant fall in almost all pollutants is observed in the pandemic year, 2020. The data imbalance problem is solved with a resampling technique and five machine learning models are employed to predict air quality. The results of these models are compared with the standard metrics. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model achieves the highest accuracy while the Support Vector Machine model exhibits the lowest accuracy. The performances of these models are evaluated and compared through established performance parameters. The XGBoost model performed the best among the other models and gets the highest linearity between the predicted and actual data.","output":"Air pollution prediction with machine learning: a case study of Indian cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within a year after its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 100 million people worldwide, with a death toll over 2 million. Vaccination remains the best hope to ultimately put this pandemic to an end. In this study, using Trimer-Tag technology, we produced both wild-type (WT) and furin site mutant (MT) S-Trimers for COVID-19 vaccine studies. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the WT and MT S-Trimers, determined at 3.2 ? and 2.6 ?, respectively, revealed that both antigens adopt a tightly closed conformation and their structures are essentially identical to that of the previously solved full-length WT S protein in detergent. The tightly closed conformation is stabilized by fatty acid and polysorbate 80 binding at the receptor binding domains (RBDs) and the N-terminal domains (NTDs), respectively. Additionally, we identified an important pH switch in the WT S-Trimer that shows dramatic conformational change and accounts for its increased stability at lower pH. These results validate Trimer-Tag as a platform technology in production of metastable WT S-Trimer as a candidate for COVID-19 subunit vaccine. IMPORTANCE An effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to end the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, using Trimer-Tag technology, we were able to produce stable and large quantities of WT S-Trimer, a subunit vaccine candidate for COVID-19 with high safety and efficacy from animal and phase 1 clinical trial studies. Cryo-EM structures of the S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate show that it predominately adopts a tightly closed prefusion state and resembles the native and full-length spike in detergent, confirming its structural integrity. WT S-Trimer is currently being evaluated in a global phase 2/3 clinical trial. Taking into account the published structures of the S protein, we also propose a model to dissect the conformation change of the spike protein before receptor binding.","output":"Cryo-electron Microscopy Structure of S-Trimer, a Subunit Vaccine Candidate for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to help us understand how and why the COVID pandemic, and its associated biopolitics of social distancing, may have affected our relationships with our own bodies and other persons, thus helping to accelerate what might be termed a bracketing of presence that was already well underway in our modern and contemporary social practices. We focus on 3 historical vectors, all rooted in specific technologies, that have profound implications at the levels of our social imaginary and prereflective ways of being: architecture, social media, and medicine. Architecture has progressively eliminated porosity between spaces by establishing clear borders between public and private spaces (also within the private ones), thereby contributing to our drive for social distancing. Social media have provided apparatuses that replace intercorporeal encounters with disembodied, virtual interactions mediated by images. Visual experiences that are more embodied, participatory, and immersed are replaced by passive forms of seeing: the other becomes an image for me, and I for the other. The object of medicine has also recently dematerialized with the advent of the new optical and digital machines of modern medicine, which can operate remotely thanks to an increasingly powerful interface reliant on computational power and the resources of artificial intelligence, thereby dispensing with body-to-body interactions.

Recently a novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), either isolated, or accompanied by thrombosis (then termed VITT). This complication is characterized by low platelet counts, and in the case of VITT also by platelet-activating platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia leading to a prothrombotic state with clot formation at unusual anatomic sites. Here, we detected anti-platelet antibodies targeting platelet glycoprotein receptors in 30% of patients with proven VITT (n=27), as well as 42% of patients with isolated thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination (n=26), indicating broad antiplatelet autoimmunity in these clinical entities. We employ in vitro and in vivo models to characterize possible mechanisms of these platelet-targeted autoimmune responses leading to thrombocytopenia. We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding of platelet associated complications after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration and highlights accidental intravenous injection as a potential mechanism of platelet targeted autoimmunity. Hence, preventing intravenous injection when administering adenovirus-based vaccines could be a potential measure against platelet associated pathologies following the vaccination.","output":"Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the predictors of belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories and willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 may aid the resolution of current and future pandemics.

We retrospectively analyzed 1,619 blood cell count from 226 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients to select parameters for inclusion in a laboratory score predicting severity of disease and survival. The score was derived from lymphocyte- and granulocyte-associated parameters and validated on a separate cohort of 140 consecutive COVID-19 patients.

Analysis of the causes and conditions of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the MO allows us to determine the most effective measures to contain the infection and prevent the occurrence of subsequent diseases in the focus. The aim is to characterize the epidemiological features of a new coronavirus infection during its nosocomial spread in medical organizations based on the analysis of outbreak incidence. Materials and methods. The data of the reporting forms ?General information on patients with positive COVID-19?, ?General information on patients with community-acquired pneumonia with positive COVID-19? (138 pieces of information), copies of ?Acts of epidemiological investigation of foci of infectious (parasitic) diseases with the establishment of a causal relationship? (57 pieces of information), copies of extraordinary reports on an emergency of a sanitary and epidemiological nature (57 pieces of information) were analyzed. The work uses epidemiological and statistical methods of research. Results. When analyzing 57 COVID-19 outbreaks in 30 medical organizations, it was found that the outbreak incidence was more often registered in multidisciplinary hospitals C 70.2% compared to 12.3% in specialized organizations of non-infectious profile, 10.5% of outbreaks were in polyclinics, 1.8% at emergency medical stations. The total number of people affected by the spread of the infection was 961, with a small proportion of children (15 people or 1.7%). Among those who fell ill with the spread of infection in the foci, the share of employees of medical organizations was 62.6%, including doctors C 16.6%, middle and junior medical workers-50.6% and 11.3%, respectively, and other categories C 21.5%. In nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19, the focality index corresponded to 16.9, and the average duration of the focus was 32.4 days. The construction of the so-called ?combined? outbreak diagram in the course of the epidanalysis allowed us to establish its total duration, which was 71 days, with the peaks of morbidity within the outbreak at intervals of 3C7 days, the greatest number of cases in the 1st and 8th days, and the gradual ?extinction? of its activity in dynamics.

However, whether succinate regulates antiviral immune response remains unclear. Here, we found that the production of succinate was reduced in RAW264.7 cells during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Using diethyl succinate to pretreat the mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells before VSV infection, the production of interferon- (IFN-), chemokine (CCXCC motif) ligand 10 (CXCL-10), and IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15) was significantly decreased, following which the VSV replication in diethyl succinate-pretreated cells was obviously increased. Moreover, succinate decreased the expression of IFN- in serum, lung, and spleen derived from the VSV-infected mice. The overall survival rate in the VSV-infected mice with diethyl succinate pretreatment was also remarkably downregulated.

METHODS: We created a survey consisting of 22 questions to assess the respondent's operative experience, location, type of practice, subspecialty, changes in clinic and operative volumes, changes to staff, and changes to income since the pandemic began. The survey was distributed electronically to neurosurgeons throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. RESULTS: Of the 724 who opened the survey link, 457 completed the survey. The respondents were from throughout the United States and Puerto Rico and represented all practices types and subspecialties. Nearly all respondents reported hospital restrictions on elective surgeries. Most reported a decline in clinic and operative volume. Nearly 70% of respondents saw a decrease in the work hours of their ancillary providers, and almost one half (49.1%) of the respondents had had to downsize their practice staff, office assistants, nurses, schedulers, and other personnel. Overall, 43.6% of survey respondents had experienced a decline in income, and 27.4% expected a decline in income in the upcoming billing cycle. More senior neurosurgeons and those with a private practice, whether solo or as part of a group, were more likely to experience a decline in income as a result of the pandemic compared with their colleagues.

This article considers the concept of cybernetics as contributing to systems-thinking, which may enable resilience strategies to come to fruition. Cybernetics is a goal-driven approach in which constant feedback is analyzed and applied in correcting the current course. We reflect on the roots and principles of the cybernetic concept, developing it into a management cybernetics concept. We take a non-technological approach in acknowledging organizations as systems. Management theories such as stakeholder and stewardship theories are systems components that can play a crucial role in effectively communicating management information within the cybernetic loop. We conclude that an integrative and cooperative relationship with legitimate stakeholders can play an essential role in an organization's preparedness.","output":"Integrated Management Cybernetics as a Foundation for Organizational Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread around the world. However, approaches to distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have not yet been reported. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 97 children with probable COVID-19. A total of 13 (13.4%) patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nucleic acid RT-PCR testing, and 41 (42.3%) patients were found to be infected with other pathogens. Notably, no pathogen was detected in 43 (44.3%) patients. Among all patients, 25 (25.8%) had familial cluster exposure history, and 52 (53.6%) had one or more coexisting conditions. Fifteen (15.5%) patients were admitted or transferred to the PICU. In the 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5 (45.5%) and 7 (63.6%) were positive for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In 22 patients with suspected COVID-19, 1 (4.5%) was positive for IgG but negative for IgM. The most frequently detected pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumonia (29, 29.9%). One patient with confirmed COVID-19 died. Our results strongly indicated that the detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 or coexisting conditions must be strengthened in pediatric patients. These cases may be difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 unless etiologic analysis is conducted. A serologic test can be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in cases where SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly suspected but the nucleic acid test is negative.

Recent studies report a high incidence and prevalence of HIV among Thai YMSM. The Thai national guidelines have recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since 2014 for key populations; free PrEP has been piloted since 2019. Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an optimal platform for innovative PrEP adherence interventions for Thai YMSM. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt the P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered) app, developed with YMSM and transwomen in the United States to improve PrEP adherence and persistence for YMSM in Thailand. The app aims to provide daily adherence support and addresses gaps in staff available for large-scale PrEP rollout needed to see population-level effects of HIV prevention. METHODS: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with YMSM and key informant interviews (KIIs) with PrEP care providers in Bangkok, Thailand, to investigate PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers, preferences for functions and features in mHealth apps among YMSM, and how to best adapt the P3 app to the Thai context. We conducted four FGDs with 4-8 participants per group and 15 KIIs. RESULTS: For FGDs, 23 YMSM participated with a mean age of 20 years (range 18-21), 96% (22/23) enrolled in full-time education, and all owned smartphones. The mean age of KII participants was 40 (range 26-60) years; most were state health service providers, with the majority being counselors (6/15, 40%) and physicians (6/15, 40%). Overall, the facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence identified were similar to those of MSM and YMSM globally including the United States. Key themes included general recommendations for improving mHealth apps in Thailand, such as presenting reliable information in an appealing format, minimizing privacy risks, and addressing connectivity challenges. Additional themes focused on P3 Thailand adaptations and were related to cultural and stylistic preferences, engagement strategies, and recommendations for new functions. To develop the adapted app, P3 Thailand, these findings were balanced with resource limitations resulting in the prioritization of minor modifications: changes in app esthetics (color scheme, iconography, and imagery) and changes in the presentation of information in two of the apps features. FGDs identified similar PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers to those already addressed within the app. CONCLUSIONS: The core elements of the P3 app address major PrEP facilitators and barriers for Thai YMSM; however, changes to the app features, including stylistic presentation, were needed to appropriately customize the app to the Thai context. Given the similarities of facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence globally, adapting existing PrEP mHealth solutions based on input from end users and key informants provides a promising approach. However, partnerships with local app designers and developers can improve the adaptation process and final product.

Current risk prediction for complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Objectives To develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast adverse events in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods Retrospective registry data from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to 5 hospitals were used to train COVID-HEART to predict all-cause mortality/cardiac arrest (AM/CA) and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events (TE) (2550 and 1854 patients, respectively). To assess COVID-HEARTs performance in the face of rapidly changing clinical treatment guidelines, an additional 1100 and 796 patients, admitted after the completion of development data collection, were used for testing. Leave-hospital-out validation was performed. Results Over 20 iterations of temporally-divided testing, the mean AUROCs were 0.917 (95% CI: 0.916-0.919) and 0.757 (95% CI: 0.751-0.763) for prediction of AM/CA and TE, respectively. The interquartile ranges of median early warning times were 14-21 hours for AM/CA and 12-60 hours for TE. The mean AUROCs for the left-out hospitals were 0.956 (95% CI: 0.936-0.976) and 0.781 (95% CI: 0.642-0.919) for prediction of AM/CA and TE, respectively. Conclusions The continuously updating, fully interpretable COVID-HEART predictor accurately predicts AM/CA and TE within multiple time windows in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In its current implementation the predictor can facilitate practical, meaningful change in patient triage and resource allocation by providing real-time risk scores for these outcomes.

Outcomes were adjudicated until August 31, 2020 or the date of death. RESULTS: There were 491 patients with COVID-19 among the 11 875 recipients in follow-up. The majority were middle aged with &#8805;1 comorbidities. Thirty-one percent were treated at home, and 69% required hospitalization. Among the hospitalized, 61% needed intensive care, 75% presented allograft dysfunction, and 46% needed dialysis. The overall 28-day fatality rate was 22% and among hospitalized patients it was 41%. Age (odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-5.09), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.72), and cardiac disease (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68) were independent factors for death. Among the 351 survivors, 19% sustained renal graft dysfunction, and there were 13 (4%) graft losses. Biopsy (n = 20) findings were diverse but decisive to guide treatment and estimate prognosis. Seroconversion was observed in 79% of the survivors and was associated with disease severity. Persistence of viral shedding was observed in 21% of the patients without detectable clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective cohort analysis confirms the high 28-day fatality rate of COVID-19, associated primarily with age and comorbidities. The high incidence of allograft dysfunction was associated with a wide range of specific histologic lesions and high rates of sequelae and graft loss.

Injection of intermedilysin into BEC-specific human CD59 (hCD59) transgenic mice induced acute and specific BEC death, representing a model to study the early signals that drive bile duct repair. Acute BEC injury induced cholestasis followed by CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and BEC proliferation.

Immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed robust upregulation of integrin v6 (ITG6) expression in this BEC injury model, after bile duct ligation, and in patients with chronic cholangiopathies. Deletion of Itgb6 gene attenuated BEC proliferation post-acute bile duct injury. Macrophage depletion or Ccr2-deficiency impaired ITG6 expression and BEC proliferation. In vitro experiments revealed that bile-acid activated monocytes promoted BEC proliferation through ITG6.

We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). FINDINGS: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82% vs. 44%), fatigue (85% vs. 50%), and myalgias (61% vs 27%); p<0.001 for all comparisons.

INTERPRETATION: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses.","output":"Clinical features, diagnostics, and outcomes of patients presenting with acute respiratory illness: a comparison of patients with and without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world is struggling against COVID-19 pandemic, and unfortunately no certain treatments are discovered yet, prevention of further transmission by isolating infected people has become an effective strategy to overcome this outbreak. That is why scaling up COVID-19 testing is strongly recommended. However, depending on the time tests are performed, they may have a high rate of false-negative results. This inaccuracy of COVID-19 testing is a challenge against controlling the pandemic. Therefore, in this paper we propose a geometric classification algorithm that is fault-tolerant to handle the inaccuracy of tests. So, in a metropolis of n people, let w + r be the number of cases that are tested, where r is the number of positive, while w is the number of negative COVID-19 cases, and k is an upper bound on the number of false-negative COVID-19 cases. The proposed algorithm takes O(r ? (log r + log w) + w3 + w log(hR)) time for isolating all positive cases together with at most k (according to the rate of error of testing) possibly positive (false-negative) cases from the rest of the people. The term hR in the time complexity is the size of convex hull of the set of positive cases, and obviously k  O(w). For simplicity of this isolation, we consider a simple convex shape (a triangle) for this classification algorithm. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Geometric Algorithm for Fault-Tolerant Classification of COVID-19 Infected People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This concluding chapter discusses how the unfurling of the Writers in the Schools (WITS) Collaborative took place against a backdrop of four pandemics: COVID-19, the movement against racial injustice, climate change, and the inevitable economic despair that spills over into the field of education.

We have previously shown that face-mask sampling (FMS) can detect exhaled tubercle bacilli and have adapted its use to quantify exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients admitted to hospital with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Between May and December 2020, we took two concomitant FMS and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) over two days, starting within 24 hours of a routine virus positive NPS in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK. Participants were asked to wear a modified duckbilled facemask for 30 minutes, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, as well as International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) mortality and deterioration scores were obtained. Exposed masks were processed by removal, dissolution and analysis of sampling matrix strips fixed within the mask by RT-qPCR. Viral genome copy numbers were determined and results classified as Negative; Low: 999 copies; Medium: 1,000-99,999 copies and High  100,000 copies per strip for FMS or per 100l for NPS. RESULTS: 102 FMS and NPS were collected from 66 routinely positive patients; median age: 61 (IQR 49 - 77), of which FMS was positive in 38% of individuals and concomitant NPS was positive in 50%. Positive FMS viral loads varied over five orders of magnitude (<10-3.3 x 10(6) genome copies/strip); 21 (32%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. High FMS viral load was associated with respiratory symptoms at time of sampling and shorter interval between sampling and symptom onset (FMS High: median (IQR) 2 days (2-3) vs FMS Negative: 7 days (7-10), p=0.002). On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher FMS viral loads were associated with higher ISARIC mortality (Medium FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 15.7, 95% CI 3.7-27.7, p=0.01) and deterioration scores (High FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 37.6, 95% CI 14.0 to 61.3, p=0.002), while NPS viral loads showed no significant association. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a simple and effective method for detecting and quantifying exhaled SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Higher FMS viral loads were more likely to be associated with developing severe disease compared to NPS viral loads. Similar to NPS, FMS viral load was highest in early disease and in those with active respiratory symptoms, highlighting the potential role of FMS in understanding infectivity.","output":"Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 quantified by face-mask sampling in hospitalised patients with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noroviruses have emerged as a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans of all ages.

Over the past two decades, biotechnological interventions, especially Bt proteins, have been successfully implemented across the world and have had major impacts on reducing chemical pesticide applications. As insects continue to adapt to insecticides, both chemical and protein-based, new methods, molecules, and modes of action are necessary to provide sustainable solutions. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a significant tool to knock down or alter gene expression profiles in a species-specific manner. In the past decade, there has been intense research on RNAi applications in crop protection. This chapter looks at the current state of knowledge in the field and outlines the methodology, delivery methods, and precautions required in designing targets. Assessing the targeting of specific gene expression is also an important part of a successful RNAi strategy. The current literature on the use of RNAi in major orders of insect pests is reviewed, along with a perspective on the regulatory aspects of the approach. Risk assessment of RNAi would focus on molecular characterization, food/feed risk assessment, and environmental risk assessment.

It was subsequently spread globally and thereby declared as a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. The disease causes severe acute respiratory illness and is highly contagious due to the fast-onward transmission. As of the mid of November 2020, the disease has affected 220 countries with more than 16 million active cases and 1.3 million deaths worldwide. Males, pregnant women, the elderly, immunosuppressed patients, and those with underlying medical conditions are more vulnerable to the disease than the general healthy population. Unfortunately, no definite treatment is available. Although remdesivir as an antiviral had been approved for use in those above 12 years of age and 40 kg weight group, it has been observed to be ineffective in large-scale SOLIDARITY trials by WHO.

A total of 150 participants were enrolled, and 136 of them completed the study through the 12-month endpoint. Our results show that, at 1 month after vaccination, both binding and neutralizing antibodies could be detected; the seropositive rate of binding antibodies and seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibodies were 99% and 50%, respectively. From 3 to 12 months, the binding and neutralizing antibodies declined over time. At 12 months, the binding and neutralizing antibodies were still detectable and significantly higher than the baseline. Gamma interferon (IFN-?3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion specifically induced by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) persisted at high levels until 6 months and could be observed at 12 months, while the levels of IL-5 and granzyme B (GzmB) were hardly detected, demonstrating a Th1-biased response. In addition, specific CD4+ T central memory (TCM), CD4+ effector memory (TEM), CD8+ TEM, and CD8+ terminal effector (TE) cells were all detectable and functional up to 12 months after the second dose, as the cells produced IFN-?3, IL-2, and GzmB in response to stimulation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

The Maldives was also included in this study, as it developed a unique strategy to cope with anticipated sea-level rise. They have developed a new city on reclaimed land and el-evated it, intending to move the majority of its population there. In our first research project, we learned of the challenges faced by Pacific Islanders when transitioning to their new lives in a foreign country. This included inter alia unemployment or lack of opportunities for upward mobility, limited access to healthcare and legal services, and discrimination. We thus developed a formal policy and legal framework for the concept of Migration with Dignity, built upon the phrase first coined by then-Kiribati President Anote Tong. Our framework represents the opportunity for migrants to live a life equal to or better than the one they left behind. We then applied our concept of the Migration with Dignity framework to the challenges faced by climate migrants in the real world. The global outbreak of COVID-19 occurred during the implementation of our new research project. This made field research almost impossible in both atoll and developed countries and led us to modify our survey methods to include tele-interviews and remote surveys through the Internet.

These compounds inhibited viral glycoprotein interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Based on this property, we evaluated their antiviral efficacy against several different viruses known to employ GAGs for host cell entry. RESULTS: Extensive analysis of the tannins mechanism of action was performed on a panel of viruses during the attachment and entry steps of infection. Virus-specific binding assays and the analysis of viral spread during treatment with these compounds were also conducted. CHLA and PUG were effective in abrogating infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), measles virus (MV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), at M concentrations and in dose-dependent manners without significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, the natural compounds inhibited viral attachment, penetration, and spread, to different degrees for each virus. Specifically, the tannins blocked all these steps of infection for HCMV, HCV, and MV, but had little effect on the post-fusion spread of DENV and RSV, which could suggest intriguing differences in the roles of GAG-interactions for these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: CHLA and PUG may be of value as broad-spectrum antivirals for limiting emerging/recurring viruses known to engage host cell GAGs for entry.

Up until now, there are no corresponding data for university policlinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of the data of the clinic's electronic medical record system (IS-H/i.s.h.med from SAP, Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, MO, United States of America and SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) and the time recording and management software TimeElement (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany), which was codeveloped at our clinic, all patient contacts of the COVID-19 shutdown were evaluated over a period of approximately 7 weeks from 18 March 2020 to 8 May 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019. In addition, quarterly revenues for the first and second quarters of 2019 and 2020 were put into perspective via SAP. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period the total number of patient contacts was reduced by 59.5% compared to the previous year. The number of lockdown period cases decreased by 74.8% compared to the same period in 2019. In particular, the university outpatient/self-paying sector recorded the largest number of lost patient contacts with a reduction to 17.2% of the 2019 baseline. The reduced patient contacts and case numbers resulted in a significant financial loss of at least ?a?218,000. Via TimeElement there was a 69.4% decrease in all special diagnostic services, with visual field examinations in particular also reduced by 75.3%. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements recorded a decrease of 60.3%. Patient tracking revealed a reduction of average patient attendance times by approximately 23% (COVID 19: 145.8a? 88.8a?min versus 189.6a? 97.2a?min in 2019). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 shutdown caused the work performance of our policlinic to drop to only about 40% of patient contacts and that of functional diagnostic examinations to only about 30%, compared to the performance in 2019; however, the reduction in the number of patients also led to a significant reduction in the time patients were present at the clinic compared to the regular workload.

METHODS Seven children aged 7.9 months to 3.7 years with femur fractures treated with the LLCPB at a single institution were retrospectively studied. All children were casted in the emergency department under conscious sedation. Radiographic and subjective outcomes were recorded. RESULTS All 7 children achieved acceptable reduction of their fractures without the need for re-reduction or cast wedging. Five of the 7 children were discharged from the emergency department; 1 child required 1 night of hospitalization and another child required 2 nights of hospitalization. There were no complications. The cost of placing an LLCPB at our institution was $430.46. The cost of placing a spica cast in the operating room was $5427.54 to $6465.00. CONCLUSIONS The long leg cast with a pelvic band seems to be an acceptable treatment for children aged 8 months to 4 years with spiral femur fractures. This technique has significant advantages over traditional and modified spica casts including allowing for uninhibited toileting, weight bearing on the unaffected leg, adjustment of hip flexion at any point after placement, and easier access to the perineum, abdomen, and chest for hygienic and medical purposes.

Social distancing measures, moreover, could alter habitual travel behavior, for example, using transit for commuting. This study explored the relationships among pandemic fear, the adoption of protective measures, changes in travel behavior, and anticipated transit usage in the post-COVID era, through the lens of protection motivation theory. Data containing multidimensional attitudinal responses about transit usage at several pandemic stages were utilized for the investigation. They were collected through a web-based survey in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Two structural equation models were estimated to examine the factors influencing anticipated postpandemic transit usage behavior. The results revealed that people taking relatively higher protective measures were comfortable taking a cautious approach such as complying with transit safety policies (TSP) and getting vaccinated to make transit trips. However, the intention to use transit on vaccine availability was found to be lower than in the case of TSP implementation. Conversely, those who were uncomfortable taking transit with caution and who were inclined to avoid travel and rely on e-shopping were most unlikely to return to transit in the future. A similar finding was observed for females, those with vehicle access, and middle-income individuals. However, frequent transit users during the pre-COVID period were more likely to continue to use transit after the pandemic.

The most common were ulcerations in different parts of the oral cavity. It is still unclear whether oral lesions in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection were a consequence of the primary effect of the virus itself or a secondary manifestation of the infection. The high presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in oral epithelial cells of the tongue and salivary glands indicates that the oral cavity may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Central to its rationale, SARS-CoV-2, in common with the triggers (viral and non-viral) of ME/CFS, is proposed to be a physiologically severe stressor, which could be targeting a stress-integrator, within the brain: the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It is proposed that inflammatory mediators, released at the site of COVID-19 infection, would be transmitted as stress-signals, via humoral and neural pathways, which overwhelm this stress-center. In genetically susceptible people, an intrinsic stress-threshold is suggested to be exceeded causing ongoing dysfunction to the hypothalamic PVN's complex neurological circuitry. In this compromised state, the hypothalamic PVN might then be hyper-sensitive to a wide range of life's ongoing physiological stressors. This could result in the reported post-exertional malaise episodes and more severe relapses, in common with ME/CFS, that perpetuate an ongoing disease state. When a certain stress-tolerance-level is exceeded, the hypothalamic PVN can become an epicenter for microglia-induced activation and neuroinflammation, affecting the hypothalamus and its proximal limbic system, which would account for the range of reported ME/CFS-like symptoms. A model for Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome is provided to stimulate discussion and critical evaluation. Brain-scanning studies, incorporating increasingly sophisticated imaging technology should enable chronic neuroinflammation to be detected, even at a low level, in the finite detail required, thus helping to test this model, while advancing our understanding of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome pathophysiology.","output":"A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Energy-intensive industries are difficult to decarbonize. They present a major challenge to the emerging countries that are currently in the midst of rapid industrialization and urbanization. This is also applicable to Japan, a developed economy, which retains a large presence in heavy industries compared to other developed economies. In this paper, the results obtained from four energy-economic and integrated assessment models were utilized to explore climate mitigation scenarios of Japans industries by 2050. The results reveal that: (i) Japans share of emissions from industries may increase by 2050, highlighting the difficulties in achieving industrial decarbonization under the prevailing industrial policies; (ii) the emission reduction in steelmaking will play a key role, which can be achieved by the implementation of carbon capture and expansion of hydrogen technologies after 2040; (iii) even under mitigation scenarios, electrification and the use of biomass use in Japans industries will continue to be limited in 2050, suggesting a low possibility of large-scale fuel switching or end-use decarbonization. After stocktaking of the current industry-sector modeling in integrated assessment models, we found that such limited uptake of cleaner fuels in the results may be related to the limited interests of both participating models and industry stakeholders in Japan, specifically the interests on the technologies that are still at the early stage of development but with high reduction potential. It is crucial to upgrade research and development activities to enable future industry-sector mitigation as well as to improve modeling capabilities of energy end-use technologies in integrated assessment models.

Viruses are adept at utilizing the universal Ca(2+) signal to create a tailored cellular environment that meets their own demands. This review summarizes most of the known mechanisms by which viruses perturb Ca(2+) homeostasis and utilize Ca(2+) and cellular Ca(2+)-binding proteins to their benefit in their replication cycles. Ca(2+) plays important roles in virion structure formation, virus entry, viral gene expression, posttranslational processing of viral proteins and virion maturation and release. As part of the review, we introduce an algorithm to identify linear EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motifs which resulted in the prediction of a total of 93 previously unrecognized Ca(2+)-binding motifs in virus proteins. Many of these proteins are nonstructural proteins, a class of proteins among which Ca(2+) interactions had not been formerly appreciated.

We validated the AI-predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb-associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities for AAK1, BIKE, and GAK. Inhibition of NAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids, which express hAAK1 and hGAK. We evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated in COVID-19 infection. In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers, and IL-6 levels. This represents an important example of an AI-predicted treatment showing scientific and clinical promise during a global health crisis.

We introduced an innovative course to rapidly on-board a group of non-intensive care unit (ICU) nurse practitioners as they begin to practice working in a critical care setting. Objective: To assess whether a brief educational course could improve non-ICU practitioners' knowledge and comfort in practicing in an intensive care setting. Methods: We implemented a multi-strategy blended 12-week curriculum composed of bedside teaching, asynchronous online learning and simulation. The course content was a product of data collected from a targeted needs assessment. The cognitive learning objectives were taught through the online modules. Four simulation sessions were used to teach procedural skills. Bedside teaching simultaneously occurred from critical care faculty during daily rounds. We assessed learning through a pre and post knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) test. Faculty assessed learners by direct observation and review of clinical documentation. We evaluated learner reaction and comfort in critical practice by comparing pre and post surveys. Results: All 7 NPs were satisfied with the course and found the format to work well with their clinical schedules. The course also improved their self-reported comfort in managing critically ill patients in a medical ICU. There was an increase in the mean group score from the pre-to the post-course MCQ (60% vs 73%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 Critical Care Course (CCCC) for NPs was implemented in our ICU to better prepare for an anticipated second surge.

Representative samples are needed to inform service planning and research. AIMS: To describe the psychiatric morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction) in referrals to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service in Qatar. METHOD: Retrospective review of 50 consecutive referrals. RESULTS: Most patients were male. Median age was 39.5 years. Thirty-one patients were symptomatic (upper respiratory tract symptoms or pneumonia) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 19 were asymptomatic (no characteristic physical symptoms of COVID-19 infection). Seventeen patients (34%) had a past psychiatric history including eight with bipolar I disorder or psychosis, all of whom relapsed. Thirty patients (60%) had physical comorbidity. The principal psychiatric diagnoses made by the consultation-liaison team were delirium (n = 13), psychosis (n = 9), acute stress reaction (n = 8), anxiety disorder (n = 8), depression (n = 8) and mania (n = 8). Delirium was confined to the COVID-19 symptomatic group (the exception being one asymptomatic patient with concurrent physical illness). The other psychiatric diagnoses spanned the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID. One patient with COVID-19 pneumonia experienced an ischaemic stroke. Approximately half the patients with mania and psychosis had no past psychiatric history. Three patients self-harmed. The commonest psychiatric symptoms were sleep disturbance (70%), anxiety (64%), agitation (50%), depressed mood (42%) and irritability (36%). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of psychiatric morbidity is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and is seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain. Objective: To compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test). Setting: One Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England. Participants: 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. Results: 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma.

It has instigated the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity. MethodsWe have developed an online \\"immuno-analytics\\" resource to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research, combining an extensive B/T-cell epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, and human CoV sequence homology mapping and protein database annotation, with an updated variant database and geospatial tracking for >7,800 non-synonymous mutation positions derived from >150,000 whole genome sequences. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, both being vaccine and serological diagnostic targets, including an analysis of changes in relevant mutation frequencies over time. ResultsOur analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. The most frequent mutations were the spike protein D614G and nsp12 L314P, which were common (>86%) across all the geographical regions. Some mutations in the spike protein (e.g. A222V and L18F) have increased in frequency in Europe during the latter half of 2020, detected using our automated algorithms. The tool also suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic serologic assays in a post-vaccine surveillance setting. ConclusionsThe immuno-analytics tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) and will serve as a useful resource for biological discovery and surveillance in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, the tool may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including potential emerging human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.","output":"An integrated in silico immuno-genetic analytical platform provides insights into COVID-19 serological and vaccine targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to assess the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) spread-prevention actions on water consumption, based on a case study in Joinville, Southern Brazil.

This was a substantial shift from a more restrictive system of coverage in previous years. However, irregular migrants continue to experience challenges accessing healthcare in Spain. This study aimed to describe the legislative and administrative barriers to implementation of this law from the perspective of providers and administrators of the healthcare system. DESIGN: We interviewed 12 individuals using a semistructured format. SETTING: Spain. PARTICIPANTS: 12 participants were interviewed; 7 males, 5 females. Participants included Spanish healthcare workers, government officials, hospital administrators, individuals working with non-governmental organisations focused on the provision of healthcare, and experts studying healthcare for underserved populations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interviews delved into personal experiences and knowledge of the entitlements and barriers of providing or trying to access care for undocumented migrants. RESULTS: The interviews yielded eight key themes: (1) context of universal healthcare in Spain pre-2012; (2) erosion of trust as rationale for more restrictive policies of 2012; (3) challenges of the 3-month residency requirement; (4) areas of ambiguity: exceptions in the 2012 Royal Decree Law not discussed in the 2018 Royal Decree Law; (5) jurisdictional authority and conflicts between national and AC government; (6) near impossibility of obtaining documentation for exportation of healthcare; (7) difficulties obtaining necessary paperwork to register residency; and (8) rise of NGOs to provide support to irregular migrants. CONCLUSION: While there has been a general political movement to expand healthcare access for undocumented migrants in Spain, there remains a fundamental need to clarify the legal entitlements for undocumented migrants nationally and create administrative consistency across autonomous communities for providing health cards for undocumented migrants.

Since other human coronaviruses are known to use co-receptors for viral cell entry, it has been suggested that DPP4 (CD26) could be a potential additional binding target or co-receptor, supported by early molecular docking simulation studies. However, recent biophysical studies have shown this interaction to be very weak. We have conducted detailed molecular docking simulations to predict the potential binding interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and DPP4 and compare them with the interactions observed in the experimentally determined structure of the complex of MERS-CoV with DPP4. Whilst the overall binding mode of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to DPP4 is predicted to be similar to that observed in the MERS-CoV-DPP4 complex, including a number of equivalent interactions, important differences in the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV result in substantially weakened interactions with DPP4. This is shown to arise from differences in the predicted proximity, nature and secondary structure at the binding interface on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. These findings do not support DPP4 being a significant receptor for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Does the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain Interact Effectively with the DPP4 (CD26) Receptor?

The effectiveness of MMD in routine settings has not yet been evaluated within a causal inference framework. We analyzed data from a robust clinical data system to evaluate MMD in Haiti. METHODS: We assessed 1-year retention in care among 21,880 ART-na?ve HIV-positive persons who started ART on or after January 1, 2017, up until November 1, 2018. We used an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal impact of MMD. This approach was used to address potential selection into specific dispensing intervals because MMD is not randomly applied to individuals. FINDINGS: We found that extending ART dispensing intervals increased the probability of retention at 12 months after ART initiation, with up to a 242%-point increase (95%CI: 219, 265) in the likelihood of retention with extending dispenses by 30 days for those receiving one-month dispenses. We observed statistically significant gains to retention with MMD with up to an approximately 4-month supply of ART; +51%-points (95%CI: 24,78). Increasing dispensing lengths for those already receiving 5-month supply of ART had a potentially negative effect on retention. INTERPRETATION: MMD for ART is an effective service delivery strategy that improves care retention for new ART recipients. There is a potentially negative effect of increasing prescription lengths for those new ART recipients already receiving longer ART supplies, though more research is needed to characterize this effect given medication supplies of this length are not common for newer ART recipients.","output":"Estimating the effect of increasing dispensing intervals on retention in care for people with HIV in Haiti"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective health interventions, saving millions of people from illness, disability and death each year The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a need to strengthen crisis management and health systems Disease prevention and improving vaccination coverage in Europe are key elements contributing to resilient health systems and ensuring better health outcomes for all For resiliency of health systems to be enhanced, sufficient monetary resources and stability of funding must be secured The objective of the study was to understand the current immunization funding landscape across the 28 European Union countries (EU28) Methods: Targeted literature search was conducted on national government websites in EU28 to collect data on immunization budget (IB) or expenditures (IE) and healthcare budget over the period (2015-2019) WHO and OECD were used when data was not available from national sources Descriptive analyses were performed;IB or IE was calculated per capita, and as a percentage of healthcare budget Data were converted to euros () Results: Either, IB or IE data were available for 26 of 28 countries among which national source data were accessible for 21 countries and for the remaining five countries data were obtained from secondary sources No data were available for Belgium and Greece Over 2015 to 2019, IB or IE per capita ranged from 0 91 (Poland) to 23 (Sweden) IB or IE represented between 0 06% (France) and 3 44% (Luxemburg) of the healthcare budget Luxemburg and Latvia were the only countries spending more than 1% of the healthcare budget on immunization while remaining 24 countries were spending less than 0 5% Conclusions: There is a need for uniformity and availability of data, including a common definition of IB or IE throughout EU28 countries","output":"PIN127 Immunization Funding Landscape in European Union 28 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has generated a transformation in students competences and university education, especially in the use of digital tools.

Unfortunately, it is found to be absent in the healthcare delivery system in most of the countries in the world. The situation is very much severe, particularly, in medium- and low-income countries like Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc. The opposite scenario is found in high-income countries, specifically, in Japan where QPC has been improved significantly by adopting the clinical engineering approach (CEA) in their PCDS. Up to now, QPC is determined based on prediction as there are no mathematical ways to evaluate it properly. In this study, we for the first time, propose a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively based on feedback control analogy taking into account of CEA in PCTMS, particularly, for clinical and surgical equipment. The model consists of three subsections: the clinical engineering department (CED), PCTMS, and health care engineering directorate (HCED). The correlation among the subsections and their performance parameters are defined and standardized. Multiple linear regression method is applied to derive the least square normal equations for each of the subsections and then the regression coefficients are solved by the standard data taken from 1000 beds hospitals of different countries. The model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC for 18 different countries including high-, middle-, and low-income countries of the world. The results obtained from the model demonstrate that the present status of QPC in Japan is 84.69% and in Pakistan, it is only 0.20%. This huge discrepancy is identified to be caused by the inclusion of CEA in PCDS of Japan. The proposed model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital/in a country and hence to take necessary steps accordingly for establishing the proposed research methodology.

However, transcripts encoding these cytokines were not detected among circulating immune cells. Rather, in situ analysis of lung specimens using RNAscope and immunofluorescent staining revealed that elevated IL-6 and CCL2 were dominantly produced by infected lung type II pneumocytes.

We now show that the results of saturation mutagenesis of H-Ras in mammalian Ba/F3 cells correlate well with the results of bacterial experiments in which H-Ras or K-Ras are co-expressed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The prominent cancer hotspots are not dominant in the Ba/F3 data. We used the bacterial system to mutagenize Ras constructs of different stabilities and discovered a feature that distinguishes the cancer hotspots. While mutations at the cancer hotspots activate Ras regardless of construct stability, mutations at lower-frequency sites (e.g. at Val 14 or Asp 119) can be activating or deleterious, depending on the stability of the Ras construct. We characterized the dynamics of three non-hotspot activating Ras mutants by using NMR to monitor hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These mutations result in global increases in HDX rates, consistent with destabilization of Ras. An explanation for these observations is that mutations that destabilize Ras increase nucleotide dissociation rates, enabling activation by spontaneous nucleotide exchange. A further stability decrease can lead to insufficient levels of folded Ras C and subsequent loss of function. In contrast, the cancer hotspot mutations are mechanism-based activators of Ras that interfere directly with the action of GAPs. Our results demonstrate the importance of GAP surveillance and protein stability in determining the sensitivity of Ras to mutational activation.","output":"A saturation-mutagenesis analysis of the interplay between stability and activation in Ras"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present as acute abdomen, although the pathophysiology remains obscure.

METHODS: We performed a literature review to document epidemiology, pathogenesis and risk factors, diagnosis, clinical presentation, evaluation and management of EVALI. RESULTS: In the summer of 2019, an outbreak of EVALI cases brought this disease entity into the national spotlight. Since being recognized as a serious pulmonary disease with public health implications, more than 2600 cases have been reported to CDC with 68 deaths as of February 2020. The pathophysiology of EVALI remains unknown. Substances such as Vitamin E acetate have been implicated as a possible causes of lung injury. The CDC has established case definitions of confirmed EVALI cases to help guide identification of the disease and assist in surveillance. While clinical judgement by healthcare providers is imperative in the identification of EVALI cases, the heterogeneous presentations of EVALI make this difficult as well. Ultimately most investigative studies should be aimed at ruling out other disease processes that can present similarly. Treatment is centered around removing the offending substance and providing supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: EVALI is a serious pulmonary disease with public health implications. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion to diagnose and exclusion of other possible causes of lung disease. It may be beneficial to involve a pulmonary specialist early in the management of this disease which is generally supportive care.","output":"E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: After the outbreak of COVID-19, psychological hotlines functioned as a main channel of psychological assistance and required a large number of professionals to provide services. These hotlines mostly offered a single-use service with short session times and allowed callers to retain anonymity. They functioned as a psychological counseling service for stress experienced in the COVID-19 public health emergency. Hotline psychological counselors must meet special competency requirements. The selection and evaluation tools for recruiting hotline counselors need to be developed. Materials and Methods: The initial scale of competence for psychological hotline counselors was formed by expert evaluation based on theoretical constructs and by using the Delphi method. A link to the questionnaire was sent to a WeChat group of counselors from 36 major psychological hotlines in China in two stages. The questionnaire consisted of questions to elicit basic demographic information and the initial competence scale. In the first phase, 343 valid samples were used to perform exploratory factor analysis. In the second phase, 334 valid samples were used to perform confirmatory factor analysis. The status of the competence of psychological hotline counselors was also analyzed. Results: The factor structure of the Psychological Hotline Counselor Competence Scale was verified and defined in terms of skills, attitude, and knowledge. The results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale has good reliability and validity ((2)/df = 1.758, GFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.91, NNFI = 0.95).

However, the precise sequence of events involving these organs remains to be established. Furthermore, whether an impaired gut-brain-BM axis is a cause or consequence of HTN is actively under investigation. This will be extremely important for translation of this fundamental knowledge to novel, innovative approaches for the control and management of HTN. Therefore, our objectives are to summarize the latest hypothesis, provide evidence for and against the impaired gut, BM and brain interactions in HTN and discuss perspectives and future directions. RECENT FINDINGS Hypertensive stimuli activate autonomic neural pathways resulting in increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiovascular modulation. This directly affects the functions of cardiovascular-relevant organs to increase blood pressure. Increases in sympathetic drive to the gut and BM also trigger sequences of signaling events that ultimately contribute to altered GM, increased gut permeability, enhanced gut- and brain-targeted pro-inflammatory cells from the BM in perpetuation and establishment of HTN.

They are all highly contagious and have severe pulmonary complications. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 run a rapidly progressive course of an acute respiratory tract infection with fever, sore throat, cough, headache and fatigue, complicated by severe pneumonia often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The infection also involves other organs throughout the body. In all three viral illnesses, the fibrinolytic system plays an active role in each phase of the pathogenesis. During transmission, the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin-system (RAAS) is involved with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, attaching to its natural receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in host cells. Both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are closely linked to the RAAS. In lesions in the lung, kidney and other organs, the two plasminogen activators urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), along with their inhibitor, plasminogen activator 1 (PAI-1), are involved.

Bioelectronic sensors, which output electrical signals for biological detection, have unique advantages in miniaturization, fast response, and portability. Despite that these nanomaterials have demonstrated high performance, complex fabrication methods that are not compatible with industrial production are usually implemented. This work deals with the development, fabrication, and testing of a rapid and cost-effective silicon nanowire biosensor that is less than one inch in width and suited for industrial mass production. The silicon nanowires are fabricated using a silver-assisted chemical etching which can be mass-producible and CMOS-compatible, tunable etch rate, and high consistency. The nanowire sensor is then fabricated using a series of nanofabrication instruments that are commonly used for semiconductor processing. The fabrication process is developed and modified to be suited for biosensing applications, and the scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the fabricated sensor has etched vertical silicon nanowire arrays of around 350 nm in length and 1010 per 1 cm2 in density.The fabricated vertically-oriented silicon nanowire array-based sensor consists of a p-n diode. Since the diode type nanowire biosensors have not been thoroughly implemented and studied, in this work, in order to simulate and validate the operation mechanisms of the proposed biosensor, an operation protocol is proposed to characterize the sensor by measuring its current as a function of the applied voltage and calculating the derivative the current-voltage function. Then the mathematical and physical models of the device are studied, and a water-gate experiment is conducted to justify the models. In the case when the unexpected disturbance occurs, the model also provides with a method to eliminate the noise in the effective resistance of the sensor.The fabricated biosensors are then functionalized for the testing of three types of analytes including two cancer cell antibodies and the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The results show that the developed sensors have high sensitivity and specificity against bovine serum albumin. Although still with a preliminary design, the proposed sensor has already been demonstrated to be able to detect clinically relevant concentrations of the target for the diagnosis of the disease.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional household surveys. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged &#8805; 18 years. MEASUREMENTS: Participants who reported that they definitely or thought they had coronavirus were classified as having self-reported COVID-19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53).

We also identified the lack of formal communication skills training for internal medicine residents in a VA continuity clinic. Aim Statement Provide formal education to residents to promote GOCCs for high-risk veterans, resulting in a 25% increase in documentation of LST notes over the academic year. A secondary aim was to increase resident confidence with engaging high-risk patients in GOCCs. Methods The number of high-risk patients with completed LST notes was monitored through VHA Support Service Center. Newly completed LST notes were assessed for author, date, clinical setting, patient death, and note content. Cycle 1 included both an educational intervention for residents and a process change involving nurses scheduling patients for GOCC appointments. Because of COVID-related barriers, cycle 2 required a process change for nurses to identify high-risk patients without LST notes during weekly huddles. Residents were surveyed before and after the intervention to assess their confidence in having GOCCs. Results The percentage of high-risk patients with completed LSTs increased (28% to 35% completion rate).

An increase in confidence was seen across all postgraduate year levels. Conclusions and Implications The largest proportion of new LST notes for high-risk patients was completed in resident clinics. These trends were maintained by process change. New LST notes completed by residents were high quality, as evidenced by direct patient quotes and clear identification of patient values and preferences. Nearly half of the high-risk patients who died did not have a completed LST note, which underscores the importance of GOCCs and need for additional interventions.","output":"Improving Goals of Care Conversations in the Outpatient Setting (QI404)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a sample of monthly data from January 2000 to July 2021, this paper investigates the risk connectedness relationship between different kinds of Chinas EPU and global oil prices in both time and frequency domains.

METHODS: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 and were admitted to hospital between March 26 and November 3, 2020 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, were included in the study. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only three deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral. CONCLUSION: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19. Conjunctival injection and higher CRP and low WBC count are reliable diagnostic parameters for MIS-C cases.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: first report from the Eastern Mediterranean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of nicotine patches, is commonly offered to pregnant women who smoke to help them to stop smoking, but this approach has limited efficacy in this population. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are also used by pregnant women who smoke but their safety and efficacy in pregnancy are unknown. Here, we report the results of a randomized controlled trial in 1,140 participants comparing refillable e-cigarettes with nicotine patches. Pregnant women who smoked were randomized to e-cigarettes (n = 569) or nicotine patches (n = 571). In the unadjusted analysis of the primary outcome, validated prolonged quit rates at the end of pregnancy in the two study arms were not significantly different (6.8% versus 4.4% in the e-cigarette and patch arms, respectively; relative risk (RR) = 1.55, 95%CI: 0.95C2.53, P = 0.08). However, some participants in the nicotine patch group also used e-cigarettes during the study. In a pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding abstinent participants who used non-allocated products, e-cigarettes were more effective than patches (6.8% versus 3.6%; RR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.14C3.26, P = 0.02).

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker ?3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: Considering the potential impact of Solidarity Program to restrain the current pandemic, the present study aims to investigate whether it was designed upon indicators of scientific productivity, defined as the level of the production of new scientific knowledge and of the institutional capabilities, estimated in terms of scientific publications and technological agreements. METHODS: The scientific documents on Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Coronavirus were retrieved from Scopus database while the technological agreements on coronavirus were obtained through Cortellis. As for the institutions and countries, we have considered the data on authors affiliations in both set of data. For comparison, we included the analysis of documents related with other drugs or therapies, such as vaccines and antibodies, which were listed in a Clarivates report on coronaviruses research. FINDINGS: Most of the analysis refers to documents on Coronavirus, the largest group. The number of documents related to WHOs drugs are almost five times higher than in the other groups. This subset of documents involves the largest and most diverse number of institutions and countries. As for agreements, we observed a smaller number of institutions involved in it, suggesting differences between countries in terms of technical and human capabilities to develop basic and/or clinical research on coronavirus and to develop new forms or products to treat or to prevent the disease.

Challenges include availability of surgical providers, improving quality of care, and building workforce capacity. Despite growing evidence that mentoring is effective in African healthcare settings, less is known about its role in surgery. We examined a multimodal approach to mentorship as part of a safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) to improve surgical quality. Our goal was to distill lessons for policy makers, intervention designers, and practitioners on key elements of a successful surgical mentorship program. METHODS: We used a convergent, mixed-methods design to examine the experiences of mentees, mentors, and facility leaders with mentorship at 10 health facilities in Tanzanias Lake Zone. A multidisciplinary team of mentors worked with surgical providers over 17 months using in-person mentorship, telementoring, and WhatsApp. We conducted surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups to capture data in four categories: (1) satisfaction with mentorship; (2) perceived impact; (3) elements of a successful mentoring program; and (4) challenges to implementing mentorship. We analyzed quantitative data using frequency analysis and qualitative data using the constant comparison method. Recurrent and unifying concepts were identified through merging the qualitative and quantitative data. RESULTS: Overall, 96% of mentees experienced the intervention as positive, 88% were satisfied, and 100% supported continuing the intervention in the future. Mentees, mentors, and facility leaders perceived improvements in surgical practice, the surgical ecosystem, and in reducing postsurgical infections. Several themes related to the interventions success emerged: (1) the interventions design, including its multimodality, side-by-side mentorship, and standardization of practices; (2) the menteeCmentor relationship, including a friendly, safe, non-hierarchical, team relationship, as well as mentors understanding of the local context; and (3) mentorship characteristics, including non-judgmental feedback, experience, and accessibility. Challenges included resistance to change, shortage of providers, mentorship dose, and logistics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a multimodal mentorship approach is promising in building the capacity of surgical providers. By distilling the experiences of the mentees, mentors, and facility leaders, our lessons provide a foundation for future efforts to establish effective surgical mentorship programs that build provider capacity and ultimately improve surgical quality.

Performed before COVID-19, the aim of the present study was to explore the perspectives of patients with CLD toward the use of virtual care with their liver specialists. Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed methods study was used to conduct this work. Results: A total of 101 patients with CLD participated in this study. Participants had a mean age of 54.5 years (range 19-87 years). Quantitative analysis revealed that 86% were willing to attend a virtual visit with their liver specialist in the future. There was a significant relationship between both age and income level and acceptance of virtual care. The themes emerging from the qualitative analysis included: (1) past experiences attending in-person visits, (2) perspectives on the use of virtual visits, and (3) perceived challenges of virtual visits. Conclusions: Although there are many potential benefits of virtual care to both the patient and the health care system, there are instances (older age, low income level) when in-person care may be preferred by patients. A tailored approach that is mindful of the individual patient's health status, ease of access to technology, and preferences must be considered when offering virtual care.

METHODS: an adapted risk stratification tool was circulated to all staff through their respective heads of departments/units. Staff were expected to voluntary assess their health and risk status in the context of COVID-19, using the tool. A central multi-disciplinary screening committee assessed submissions and invited staff who required further evaluation for physical interviews. Respondents were categorized into three risk/exposure groups from lowest to highest - A, B, and C, based on their individual health assessments, occupational exposures, and information obtained from direct interviews. RESULTS: the committee received submissions from 746 staff, representing 19.4% (about a fifth) of the hospitals 3,840 staff. One hundred and twenty two of these were invited for physical interviews, of whom 88 (72.1%) were categorized as high risk (Category C): pregnancy (53.4%); bronchial asthma (19.3%); hypertension (11.4%); cancer (3.4%) and sickle cell disease (2.3%); fractures and pulmonary tuberculosis (1%, respectively).

Palivizumab is the only immunoprophylaxis therapy approved for RSV infection in infants with hemodynamically significant acyanotic or cyanotic CHD. OBJECTIVE: Identify the compliance rate with vaccination and study the effect of RSV vaccination on hospital admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. SETTING: Cardiac center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient data was obtained from outpatient clinic records, inpatient records, and a surgical database for the period from October 2010 to March 2016. Infants with hemodynamically significant CHD, cyanotic CHD and moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension were included in the study. Palivizumab 15/mg/kg was given monthly starting from October, the usual beginning of the epidemic season, with five doses in the first season and six doses in the remaining season scheduled for administration. Patients were interviewed at every clinic visit for any side effects during the previous month, occurrence of any RSV infection and any hospital admission. Selection criteria included RSV vaccination and absence of RSV disease. Patients were excluded if they had RSV infection or a repaired cardiac lesion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance rate, hospital admission frequency and period of stay. SAMPLE SIZE: 530 during six seasons of RSV epidemics. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (2.6%) developed RSV infection and 13 (2.5%) required hospital admission, but only one patient (0.1%) needed intensive care admission. There were no deaths related to RSV infection; however 11 patients died due to causes unrelated to RSV infection. The average compliance rate was 97%.

Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2. Author summary SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an illness with clinical manifestations that vary from asymptomatic or mild to severe; examples include severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Here, we showed that cynomolgus monkeys selected according to the T cell populations in peripheral blood have different outcomes after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of animal models for vaccine evaluation.","output":"The peripheral T cell population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contactless and efficient systems are implemented rapidly to advocate preventive methods in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent reports have shown that when participants watch muted videos of speakers, the phonological information about the acoustic speech envelope is tracked by the visual cortex. However, the speech signal also carries much richer acoustic details, e.g. about the fundamental frequency and the resonant frequencies, whose visuo-phonological transformation could aid speech processing. Here, we investigated the neural basis of the visuo-phonological transformation processes of these more fine-grained acoustic details and assessed how they change with ageing. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) data while participants watched silent intelligible and unintelligible videos of a speaker. We found that the visual cortex is able to track the unheard intelligible modulations of resonant frequencies and the pitch linked to lip movements. Importantly, only the processing of intelligible unheard formants decreases significantly with age in the visual and also in the cingulate cortex. This is not the case for the processing of the unheard speech envelope, the fundamental frequency or the purely visual information carried by lip movements. These results show that unheard spectral fine-details (along with the unheard acoustic envelope) are transformed from a mere visual to a phonological representation. Aging affects especially the ability to derive spectral dynamics at formant frequencies. Since listening in noisy environments should capitalize on the ability to track spectral fine-details, our results provide a novel focus on compensatory processes in such challenging situations.","output":"Cortical tracking of unheard formant modulations derived from silently presented lip movements and its decline with age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Empiric antibiotics for community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) are often prescribed to patients with COVID-19, despite a low reported incidence of co-infections. Stewardship interventions targeted at facilitating appropriate antibiotic prescribing for CABP among COVID-19 patients are needed. We developed a guideline for antibiotic initiation and discontinuation for CABP in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of this intervention on the duration of empiric CABP antibiotic therapy among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study of adult patients admitted between 3/1/2020 to 4/25/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. Patients were excluded if they were initiated on antibiotics > 48 h following admission or if another source of infection was identified. The primary outcome was the duration of antibiotic therapy (DOT) prior to the guideline (March 1 to March27, 2020) and after guideline implementation (March 28 to April 25, 2020). We also evaluated the clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions, length of stay) among those initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, 102 pre-intervention and 404 post-intervention. Prior to the intervention, 74.5% (n = 76) of patients with COVID-19 received empiric antibiotics compared to only 42% of patients post-intervention (n = 170), p < 0.001. The median DOT in the post-intervention group was 1.3 days shorter (p < 0.001) than the pre-intervention group, and antibiotics directed at atypical bacteria DOT was reduced by 2.8 days (p < 0.001). More patients in the post-intervention group were initiated on antibiotics based on criteria consistent with our guideline (68% versus 87%, p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups in terms of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Following the implementation of a guideline outlining recommendations for initiating and discontinuing antibiotics for CABP among COVID-19 inpatients, we observed a reduction in antibiotic prescribing and DOT. The guideline also resulted in a significant increase in the rate of guideline-congruent empiric antibiotic initiation.

Here, we review how knowledge gained from these approaches, including viral RNA quantification and sequence analyses, have been rapidly applied to study SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood of infected individuals by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR); and, as in HIV-1 infection, there is growing evidence that the level of viral RNA in plasma may be related to COVID disease severity. Unlike HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly conserved limiting SARS-CoV-2 sequencing applications to investigating interpatient genetic diversity for phylogenetic analysis. Sensitive sequencing technologies, originally developed for HIV-1, will be needed to investigate intrapatient SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation in response to antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. SUMMARY: Methods used for HIV-1 have been rapidly applied to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 to understand pathogenesis and prognosis. Further application of such methods should improve precision of therapy and outcome.","output":"Adaptation of advanced clinical virology assays from HIV-1 to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human norovirus is a leading cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis, which affects all age groups and are found globally.

Comparison of amino acid residues deduced from the viral nucleotide sequence with those of historical and contemporary norovirus GII.4 strains revealed notable differences, which mapped to the defined antigenic sites of the viral major capsid protein. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggests that GII.4 Hong Kong shared common ancestry with GII.4 Osaka first reported in 2007, and more importantly, did not evolve from the now-prevalent GII.4 Sydney lineage.

However, the reported prevalence of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction varies widely, and the reason for the inter-study differences is unclear. Hence, in this meta-analysis, we performed subgroup analyses to investigate the factors that contribute to the inter-study variability in the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. METHODS: Out of 943 citations, we included 55 eligible studies with 13,527 patients with COVID-19 for a meta-analysis. Calculating the data extracted from each study, the weighted summary prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was estimated using a Freeman-Tukey transformation with models based on random-effects assumptions. A meta-analysis of variance compared the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction according to regional, chronological, demographic, and methodologic factors, respectively. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were 51.4% and 47.5%, respectively, in the random-effect model. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly different among four geographical regions (both P < 0.001, respectively). Although the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction did not significantly differ according to the time of enrollment, the subgroup analyses including only studies from the same geographical region (Europe) revealed a significant difference in olfactory dysfunction according to the time of enrollment.

To assess these interactions, standard statistical tests of independence suggest that the prevalence ratio--defined as the ratio of co-infection prevalence to the product of single-infection prevalences--should equal unity for non-interacting pathogens. As a result, earlier epidemiological studies aimed to estimate the prevalence ratio from co-detection prevalence data, under the assumption that deviations from unity implied interaction. To examine the validity of this assumption, we designed a simulation study that built on a broadly applicable epidemiological model of co-circulation of two respiratory viruses causing seasonal epidemics. By focusing on the pair influenza-SARS-CoV-2, we first demonstrate that the prevalence ratio systematically under-estimates the strength of interaction, and can even misclassify antagonistic or synergistic interactions that persist after clearance of infection. In a global sensitivity analysis, we further identify properties of viral infection--such as a high reproduction number or a short infectious period--that blur the interaction inferred from the prevalence ratio. Altogether, our results suggest that epidemiological studies based on co-detection prevalence data provide a poor guide to assess interactions among respiratory viruses.","output":"The pitfalls of inferring virus-virus interactions from co-detection prevalence data: Application to influenza and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore orthopaedic and musculoskeletal clinicians' views and experiences of legal, safety, safeguarding and security issues regarding the use of virtual consultations (VC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective was to suggest ways to overcome these issues. METHODS: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was conducted, seeking the views and experiences of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal medically qualified and Allied Health Professionals in the United Kingdom. Descriptive statistical analysis was employed for quantitative data and a qualitative content analysis undertaken for qualitative data. Findings were presented in accordance with the four key issues. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety professionals (206 physiotherapists, 78 medically qualified professionals, 6 'other' therapists) participated in the survey. Of the 290 participants, 260 (90%) were not using VC prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 248 respondents (86%) were unsure whether their professional indemnity insurance covered VC, 136 (47%) had considered how they would handle an issue of safeguarding whilst the remainder had not, 126 (43%) had considered what they would do if, during a virtual consultation, a patient suffered an injury (e.g. bang on their head) or a fall (e.g. mechanical or a medical event like syncope) and 158 (54%) reported they felt the current technological solutions are secure in terms of patient data. Qualitative data provided additional context to support the quantitative findings such as validity of indemnification, accuracy of diagnosis and consent using VC, safeguarding issues; and security and sharing of data. Potential changes to practice have been proposed to address these issues. CONCLUSIONS: VC have been rapidly deployed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic often without clear guidance or consensus on many important issues.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study that includes 322 adult patients admitted and stayed (>24 hours) to the ICU between February 1, 2020, and August 30, 2020 in a community-based, teaching hospital in Rhode Island .Medication complexity was assessed using two MRC scoring tools: MRC Index (MRCI) and the MRC in ICU (MRCICU). We used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify the association between MRC scores and clinical outcomes and to predict the clinical outcomes. RESULTS Among the 317 patients included in the study (55.2% men with a median age of 62 [IQR: 51-75] years). Higher MRC scores (i.e., > 63 MRCI or > 6 MRCICU) were associated with increased mortality (14% and 15%), longer ICU length of stay (LOS )(30% and 34%), and need for MV (24% and 28%). MRCICU scores at 24 hours were found to be a significant risk factor in all clinical outcomes (ICU mortality, LOS, and MV) with Odds Ratio (ORs) of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06-1.19), 1.17 (1.1- 1.24), and 1.21 (1.14- 1.29), respectively.

Therefore, data regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to induce humoral immunity in MS patients treated with B- and T-cell depleting agents is urgently warranted. Cladribine tablets are a high-efficacy disease-modifying treatment that exerts its therapeutic effect via sustained but transient lymphocyte depletion. AIM: We report humoral responses in a German cohort of MS patients treated with cladribine tablets. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients 18 years who were treated with cladribine tablets for relapsing MS in the first or second year and were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Two weeks after the second vaccination at the earliest, blood samples were obtained for the assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, lymphocyte counts, B-cells, CD4(+) T-cells, and CD8(+) T-cells. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantified with the LIAISON(?) SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. Positivity was defined at a cutoff value of 33.8 BAU/mL. RESULTS: In total, 38 patients (73.7% female, aged 23C66 years) were included in the analysis. Ten patients (26.3%) were treatment-na?ve before initiating treatment with cladribine tablets. Most patients (84.2%) received mRNA vaccines. The time between the last dose of cladribine tablets and vaccination ranged between 2 and 96 weeks. Six patients (15.8%) were vaccinated within 4 weeks of their last cladribine dose. All patients achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels. Humoral immune response was independent of age, time of vaccination in relation to the last cladribine dose, lymphocyte counts as well as B- and T-cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with cladribine tablets did not impair humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination.

METHODS Consecutive cases of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery carried out between February 2009 and December 2012 at nine academic institutions were included. We examined the surgical outcomes, including conversion and complications rates. RESULTS Four hundred and sixty-nine cases were included in the analysis. The most common procedure was adrenalectomy (n = 177) and the second most common procedure was radical nephrectomy (n = 143). The procedures also included nephroureterectomy (n = 40), living donor nephrectomy (n = 40), pyeloplasty (n = 30), urachal remnant excision (n = 9), simple nephrectomy (n = 7), radical prostatectomy (n = 6) and others (n = 17). The access sites included umbilicus (n = 248, 53%) and other sites (n = 221, 47%). A transperitoneal approach was used in 385 cases (82%), and retroperitoneal approach in 84 cases (18%). The median operation time of all procedures was 198 min. Conversion to reduced port surgery, conventional laparoscopy, or open surgery was noted in 27 cases (5.8%), 12 cases (2.6%), and two cases (0.4%), respectively, with an overall conversion rate of 8.7%.

INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Antibiotic therapy was de-escalated in 58 patients (40.5%), who had decreased mortality at day 15 (5.1% vs. 31.7%) and day 28 (12% vs. 43.5%) and shorter intensive care unit (17.2  1.2 vs. 22.7  6.3 days) and hospital (23.7  2.8 vs. 29.8  11.1 days) stay (p < 0.05).

Thus, immunogenicity of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might be impaired in this group. To determine immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic dialysis, we analyzed the humoral and T-cell response after two doses of mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (BNT162b2 BioNTech/Pfizer). This observational study included 43 patients on dialysis before vaccination with two doses of Tozinameran 21 days apart. Overall, 36 patients completed the observation period until three weeks after the second dose and 32 patients were further analyzed at week 10. Serum samples were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies ~1, ~3C4 and ~10 weeks after the second vaccination. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were assessed at ~3C4 weeks by an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Antibody and T cell outcomes at this timepoint were compared to a group of 44 elderly patients not on dialysis, after immunization with Tozinameran. Median age of patients on chronic dialysis was 74.0 years (IQR 66.0, 82.0). The proportion of males was higher (69.4%) than females. Only 20/36 patients (55.6%, 95%CI: 38.29C71.67) developed SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies at the first sampling, whereas 32/36 patients (88.9%, 95%CI: 73.00C96.38) demonstrated IgG detection at the second sampling. In a longitudinal follow-up at ~10 weeks after the second dose, the proportion of dialysis patients reactive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG decreased to 27/32 (84.37%, 95%CI: 66.46C94.10) The proportion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgA decreased from 33/36 (91.67%; 95%CI: 76.41C97.82) at weeks 3C4 down to 19/32 (59.38; 95%CI: 40.79C75.78).

Preliminary data demonstrated not only the vaccines efficacy rates of greater than 95% after a second dose, but also marked safety. Initial data showed only 21 cases of anaphylaxis of greater than 1.8 million doses administered. The majority of those patients had a history of anaphylaxis and presented within the first 15 minutes after administration of the vaccine.2 CASE REPORT: We describe a patient who had an anaphylactic reaction to her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) vaccine with no prior history of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. This reaction required multiple doses of epinephrine and a four-day hospitalization. We review both the available reports of anaphylaxis to the SAR CoV-2 vaccine and information on other prolonged cases of anaphylaxis. CONCLUSION: Our case report is unique in that the patient, despite no prior history of anaphylaxis, had a prolonged course requiring a four-day hospitalization.

Examining the prevalence of mental health issues in a work force with an elevated occupational risk is fundamental towards ensuring their wellbeing and implementing safeguard measures. The goal of this study is therefore to report the prevalence of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic development, and PTSD in Norwegian ambulance personnel. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey (Questback?), performed among operative personnel employed in the Emergency Medical Services in the Regional Health Trust of Central Norway between 18. February and 9. April 2021. The study was sent to 1052 eligible participants. Questions reported demographic data, a traumatic events exposure index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (Depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, Posttraumatic symptom scale (PTSD) and Posttraumatic change scale. RESULTS: The response rate in this study was 45.5% (n = 479/1052). The mean age of respondents was 37.1 years (std. 11.1) and 52.8% (n = 253) were male. Of the respondents, 80.6% (n = 386) were married or had a partner, and 91.6% (n = 439) reported having access to a peer support programme, with 34.9% (n = 167) reporting that they had utilized peer support. In this study, 5% (n = 24) showed a prevalence of manifest posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, while 8.6% (n = 41) reported moderate to severe depression and 2.9% (n = 14) presented moderate to severe symptoms of general anxiety. Of the respondents, 77.2% (n = 370) reported personal growth because of their work experiences. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that Norwegian ambulance personnel report a prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression, which is slightly higher for men, and lower for the female proportion in this study, when compared to an adult Norwegian population. The vast majority of respondents reported personal growth because of their work experience, and both the degree of peer support and having a partner seem to influence levels of posttraumatic stress and -development.

Breast cancer (BC) affects one in eight females globally. In 2018 alone, 1.4 million cases were identified worldwide in postmenopausal women and 645,000 cases in premenopausal females, and this burden is constantly increasing. This shows that still a lot of efforts are required to discover therapeutic remedies for this disease. One of the major clinical complications associated with the treatment of breast carcinoma is the development of therapeutic resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR) and consequent relapse on therapy are prevalent issues related to breast carcinoma; it is due to our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of breast carcinoma disease. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in drug resistance is critical. For management of breast carcinoma, the treatment decision not only depends on the assessment of prognosis factors but also on the evaluation of pathological and clinical factors. Integrated data assessments of these multiple factors of breast carcinoma through multiomics can provide significant insight and hope for making therapeutic decisions. This omics approach is particularly helpful since it identifies the biomarkers of disease progression and treatment progress by collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological molecules within and among the cancerous cells. The scrupulous understanding of cancer and its treatment at the molecular level led to the concept of a personalized approach, which is one of the most significant advancements in modern oncology. Likewise, there are certain genetic and non-genetic tests available for BC which can help in personalized therapy. Genetically inherited risks can be screened for personal predisposition to BC, and genetic changes or variations (mutations) can also be identified to decide on the best treatment. Ultimately, further understanding of BC at the molecular level (multiomics) will define more precise choices in personalized medicine.

Many side effects have been observed following radiation therapy with chemotherapy; hence, exploring new treatment modalities for NPC is an important future direction. Angiotensin-(1C7) [Ang-(1C7)] is an endogenous heptapeptide hormone and important component of the reninCangiotensin system that acts through both the Mas receptor and AT2 receptor, exhibiting anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in cancer cells. However, the anti-cancer activity of Ang-(1C7) related to autophagy in NPC remains largely debated. The effects and signaling pathway(s) involved in the Ang-(1C7)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Ang-(1C7) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1C7) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway with involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways in vitro study. In addition, pre-treatment with Ang-(1C7) inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by inducing autophagy, suggesting a correlation between PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition and the abovementioned anti-cancer activities. However, no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1C7) post-treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that Ang-(1C7) plays a novel role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviation the incidence of NPC and preventive treatment of recurrent NPC.

OBJECTIVE This report aimed to describe electroencephalographic findings in COVID-19 patients from a general tertiary hospital in S?o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS It was a retrospective, observational, and non-interventional study. Data were collected anonymously, comprising inpatients from Mar 1 to Jun 30, 2020, either confirmed (positive RT-PCR) or probable cases (CO-RADS 4/5) who had performed EEG during hospitalization. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, 17 (60.7%) women and 11 men, with a median age of 58 (minimum and maximum: 18-86; IQR 23.5). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 22 (78.5%). Twenty-one patients (75%) had severe disease, requiring mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 16 (57.1%) patients developed adjunct sepsis throughout hospitalization. There was no specific pattern found for COVID-19 in EEG. No patients presented with status epilepticus or electrographic events; most patients developed an encephalopathic pattern, as seen in most studies, with a high prevalence of altered mental status as an indication for EEG. Adjunct sepsis was associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS EEG presents as a useful tool in the context of COVID-19, as in other conditions, to differentiate nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) from encephalopathy and other causes of mental status alterations.

Like neutrophils, platelets also engage in pro- as well as anti-inflammatory roles in regulating cerebrovascular inflammation. These anucleated cells are at the core of stroke pathogenesis and can trigger an ischemic event via adherence to the hypoxic cerebral endothelial cells culminating in aggregation and clot formation. In this article, we review and highlight the evolving role of neutrophils and platelets in ischemic stroke and discuss ongoing preclinical and clinical strategies that may produce viable therapeutics for prevention and management of stroke.","output":"Neutrophils and Platelets: Immune Soldiers Fighting Together in Stroke Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluation of COVID-19 related complication is challenging in pregnancy, due to concerns about ionizing radiation risk to mother and the fetus.

Strategies are needed to identify and characterize animal viruses that pose the greatest risk of spillover and spread in humans and inform public health interventions. Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from testing 509,721 samples from 74,635 animals as part of a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. Using a scientifically informed process, we capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks.

During the lockdown period, a huge number of restrictions were imposed, hence interrupting a wide range of activities previously proven to be necessary for some people. Due to the circumstances, rehabilitation treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders have been suspended, resulting in consequent distress for the children themselves and their parents. To overcome this problem, a tele-rehabilitation approach has proven to be an excellent solution to give continuity to children's rehabilitation. The tele-rehabilitation approach allows access to rehabilitation services directly from home. During lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) HomeKit, developed by Khymeia, was employed as a rehabilitation system for the treatment of posture and balance of an adolescent with disabilities for the first time ever. Specifically, a 17-year-old female patient was enrolled and evaluated by the clinical staff before and after the home-training sessions. The system was delivered to the patient's home so that she could perform the tasks in a familiar environment, while under the supervision of the clinical staff. Through a specific platform, using different modules of the system, therapists could remotely check that the proposed exercises were properly performed and provide feedback and/or increase the difficulty according to the patient's needs and progress. Therefore, the treatment performed was carried out at home in a personalized, intensive, and playful way; characteristics do not present in a traditional treatment. Our results are promising and demonstrate both the efficacy of rehabilitation exercises carried out at home and the feasibility of home-based rehabilitation, when using the VRRS HomeKit even with adolescents. The VRRS HomeKit presents some limitations, such as the need to have the line connection and free space at home, the presence of technical issues, and the education of parents and patients to understand the instructions.

If the stress experience is not adequately compensated, it can have a negative impact on postoperative recovery, as can untreated comorbid mental disorders. METHODS A selective literature review on emotional distress and mental comorbidities in heart surgery patients and a scoping review on the spectrum and effectiveness of perioperative psychological interventions to compensate and reduce the stress experience. RESULTS Mental factors such as depressive symptoms or anxiety disorders are associated with an elevated risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients treated for heart disease. Mental comorbidities occur more frequently in these patients than in the general population. Following the manifestation of chronic heart disease (CHD), for example, 15-20% of the patients display severe depressive disorders. A few psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce anxiety and depression, emotional distress, consumption of analgesics, and extubation time have been found effective, with low to moderate evidence quality. Many different psychological interventions have proved useful in clinical practice, including multimodal, multiprofessional interventions incorporating medications, education, sports, and exercise as well as psychosocial therapy including stress management. Individual psychotherapy during the period of acute inpatient treatment after myocardial infarction is also effective. CONCLUSION Because psychosocial factors are important, the current guidelines recommend systematic screening for mental symptoms and comorbidities in advance of heart transplantation or the implantation of ventricular assist devices (VAD).

METHODS: We conducted a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) or SXT (trimethoprim 10 mg/kg/day + sulfamethoxazole 50 mg/kg/day) orally for 7 days for UFI treatment in Nepal. We enrolled patients (aged 3-64 years) presenting to two Kathmandu hospitals with temperature &#8805; 38.0C for &#8805;4 days without localising signs. The primary endpoint was fever clearance time (FCT); secondary endpoints were treatment failure and adverse events. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02773407. RESULTS: From June 2016 to May 2019, we randomized 326 participants (163 in each arm); 87 (26.7%) had blood culture-confirmed enteric fever. In all participants, the median FCT was 2.7 days (95% CI 2.6-3.3) in the SXT arm and 2.1 days (95% CI 1.6-3.2) in the azithromycin arm 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.059). The hazard ratio of treatment failures by 28 days between azithromycin and SXT was 0.62 (95% CI 0.37-1.05, p=0.073). Planned sub-group analysis showed azithromycin resulted in faster FCT in those with sterile blood cultures and less relapses in culture-confirmed enteric fever.

The drug-likeness score and intestinal absorptivity of each compound were also predicted. The network of compounds, proteins, and modulated pathways was constructed using Cytoscape, and docking was performed using autodock4.0, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns Molecular Dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Withanolide_Q was predicted to modulate the highest number of proteins, showed human intestinal absorption, and was predicted for the highest drug-likeness score. Similarly, combined network interaction identified Withanolide_Q to target the highest number of proteins; RAC1 was majorly targeted, and fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis associated pathway were chiefly regulated. Similarly, Withanolide_D and Withanolide_G were predicted to have a better binding affinity with PLpro, Withanolide_M with 3CLpro, and Withanolide_M with spike protein based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bond interactions.

We develop a novel theoretical account, based on existing empirical research, of perceptual and psychological processes that may account for changes in speeding behavior under low traffic volume conditions. These include impaired ability to accurately perceive and control speed due to change in visual information, decreased salience of certain norms about socially appropriate speeds, lower perceived risk of speeding, and increased boredom leading to risk-taking behaviors. Further, we consider that individual attitude functions may account for the observed split in speeding behavior.","output":"Speeding through the pandemic: Perceptual and psychological factors associated with speeding during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as a key element of epidemic control.

We recruited individuals testing positive for COVID-19 PCR at an academic medical center. Anterior nasal swabs were stored in viral transport media and evaluated by viral load quantification and whole genome sequencing. We created serial dilutions from 2.5x103-2.5x105 viral copies/specimen for two delta and omicron specimens, respectively, and tested each with the BinaxNow assay per manufacturer instructions. Results were interpreted by three readers, blinded to the specimen variant and concentration. All omicron and delta specimens with concentrations of 100,000 copies/swab or greater were positive by the BinaxNow Assay, a concentration similar to previously reported limits of detection for this assay.

We surveyed residents from a national sample of internal medicine (IM) residency programs to describe their experiences with the transition to virtual morning report (MR), a highly valued core educational conference. OBJECTIVE: Assess resident views about virtual MR content and teaching strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Anonymous, web-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: Residents from 14 academically affiliated IM residency programs. MAIN MEASURES: The 25-item survey on virtual MR included questions on demographics; frequency and reason for attending; opinions on who should attend and teach; how the virtual format affects the learning environment; how virtual MR compares to in-person MR with regard to participation, engagement, and overall education; and whether virtual MR should continue after in-person conferences can safely resume. The survey included a combination of Likert-style, multiple option, and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Six hundred fifteen residents (35%) completed the survey, with a balanced sample of interns (39%), second-year (31%), and third-year (30%) residents. When comparing their overall assessment of in-person and virtual MR formats, 42% of residents preferred in-person, 18% preferred virtual, and 40% felt they were equivalent. Most respondents endorsed better peer-engagement, camaraderie, and group participation with in-person MR. Chat boxes, video participation, audience response systems, and smart boards/tablets enhanced respondents educational experience during virtual MR. Most respondents (72%) felt that the option of virtual MR should continue when it is safe to resume in-person conferences. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual MR was a valued alternative to traditional in-person MR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents feel that the virtual platform offers unique educational benefits independent of and in conjunction with in-person conferences. Residents support the integration of a virtual platform into the delivery of MR in the future.

Considerations on how to adequately ensure the well-being of research staff are largely neglected in contemporary ethics discourse. This systematic review aims to identify the ethical challenges that research staff across different hierarchical levels and scientific disciplines face when conducting research in LMICs. METHODS: We searched 13 electronic databases and handsearched publications in six selected journals as well as the reference lists of all included studies. No restrictions were applied with respect to the publication date, research design, and target population. RESULTS: 23 151 studies were retrieved, 183 of which met our inclusion criteria. We identified nine different types of ethical challenges that research staff may be exposed to during field research, including (1) role conflicts that can emerge from participants help requests and the high level of deprivation found in certain study settings, (2) feelings of guilt and (3) detrimental mental health impacts. Further challenges were (4) sexual harassment (5) safety risks and (6) political repression, particularly in postconflict, disaster-ridden or autocratic study contexts. Additionally, studies reported (7) inadequate working conditions and (8) power imbalances within research teams, while (9) ethics boards were found to be ill equipped to anticipate and address emerging risks, thus increasing the ethical liability of researchers. CONCLUSION: This review revealed several complex ethical challenges that research staff may face during data collection. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 8.8 on safe and secure working environments and to protect research staff from harm, amendments must urgently be made to current ethical standards.

Such platforms embed shopping experiences within IM apps, e.g. WeChat, WhatsApp, where real-world friends post and recommend products from the platform in IM group chats and quite often form lasting recommending/buying relationships. How and why do users engage in IM based social commerce? Do such platforms create novel experiences that are distinct from prior commerce? And do these platforms bring changes to user social lives and relationships? To shed light on these questions, we launched a qualitative study where we carried out semi-structured interviews on 12 instant messaging based social commerce users in China. We showed that IM based social commerce: 1) enables more accessible, cost-reducing and immersive user shopping experience, 2) shapes user decision-making process in shopping through pre-existing social relationship, mutual trust, shared identity and community norm, and 3) creates novel social interactions, which can contribute to new tie formation while maintaining existing social relationships. We demonstrate that all these unique aspects link closely to the characteristics of IM platform, as well as the coupling of user social and economic lives under such business model.

Classical examples are diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. However, recently the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), is often referred to, as an unspecific parameter/marker (e.g., for cardiac events or in oncological studies). The measurement of RDW requires venous blood samples to perform the complete blood cell count (CBC). Here, we introduce Erysense, a lab-on-a-chip-based point-of-care device, to evaluate red blood cell flow properties. The capillary chip technology in combination with algorithms based on artificial neural networks allows the detection of very subtle changes in the red blood cell morphology. This flow-based method closely resembles in vivo conditions and blood sample volumes in the sub-microliter range are sufficient. We provide clinical examples for potential applications of Erysense as a diagnostic tool [here: neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (NAS)] and as cellular quality control for red blood cells [here: hemodiafiltration (HDF) and erythrocyte concentrate (EC) storage]. Due to the wide range of the applicable flow velocities (0.1C10 mm/s) different mechanical properties of the red blood cells can be addressed with Erysense providing the opportunity for differential diagnosis/judgments. Due to these versatile properties, we anticipate the value of Erysense for further diagnostic, prognostic, and theragnostic applications including but not limited to diabetes, iron deficiency, COVID-19, rheumatism, various red blood cell disorders and anemia, as well as inflammation-based diseases including sepsis.","output":"Erysense, a Lab-on-a-Chip-Based Point-of-Care Device to Evaluate Red Blood Cell Flow Properties With Multiple Clinical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative regulators of platelet activation are a relatively unexplored aspect of platelet physiology yet have an important role in tempering thrombus development by contributing much needed negative regulation to a process that is amplified by several positive feedback mechanisms. Some negative regulators, such as RASA3 and JAM-A, act as gatekeepers that modulate key mediators of activation and provide barriers that must be deactivated to permit full activation and stable thrombus formation. Other negative regulators, such as PECAM-1 and other proteins that signal through ITIMs, come into play once platelets are activated and provide restraining, negative feedback for activatory pathways. Many platelet-derived inhibitors have been identified but not fully characterised and so questions remain regarding the mechanisms that underlie the effects on platelet activity following their activation, inhibition or genetic disruption. However, dysregulation of inhibitory signals is believed to contribute to enhanced risk of thrombosis in diseases such as diabetes and other pathological conditions.

The treatment of individuals with eating disorders can involve slow treatment progression and addressing comorbidities which can contribute to staff burnout. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has emerged as a viable treatment option and has reduced staff burnout in several other settings. Our aim was to describe frontline staff burnout using mixed methodology on a DBT-trained combined inpatient/day hospital unit for pediatric eating disorders. METHOD: Frontline staff were trained to provide DBT skills for adolescents with eating disorders. Twelve months following the training and implementation, they completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and a qualitative interview. Directed and summative content analyses were used. RESULTS: Eleven frontline staff including nurses, child life specialists and child and youth workers participated. The CBI revealed that only one staff member experienced high personal burnout, while another experienced high client-related burnout. Qualitative data indicated that all frontline staff felt DBT had the potential to reduce burnout. CONCLUSION: Qualitative data indicate that staff believe that DBT may hold promise in reducing burnout for pediatric frontline staff who treat children and adolescents with eating disorders. Further study is needed. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Understanding burnout is particularly important for nursing staff in inpatient and day hospital settings for eating disorders, as nursing staff generally have the most frequent patient contact; thought to be a risk factor for burnout. The reduction of burnout can prevent detrimental effects on job performance, personal well-being, and patient outcomes. Our exploratory study shows that frontline staff believe that DBT may have the potential to reduce burnout in staff treating children and adolescents with eating disorders in a combined inpatient/day hospital setting.

In the present time, one of the important interests of decision makers and managers in almost all kinds of hospitals to adopt discovery plans correctly patient's status (Positive, Negative). Accordingly, managements of hospitals become mindful about the status of these patients. In particular, to ensure adequate care at the appropriate time for the patient. The interest of the role of data mining has increased from here that its aim is to discover information from large volumes of data. In this paper, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm was applied to construct a model of classification for predicting patients' status using actual dataset gathered from the many Iraqi hospitals through a questionnaire prepared and distributed for 290 patients. A large number of features are included in the medical data sets. When the data sets contain noisy features, the performance of the classifier is reduced. To solve this problem, select the subset feature. The selection of features enhances accuracy. Thus to get a highly accurate model and identifying the most effective features that affect the status, two experiments were executed, first experiment implemented without using K-NN and second experiment implemented based on CorrelationAttributeEval, GainRatio AttributeEval, and ReliefF AttributeEval algorithms that are running in WEKA tool for enabling decision makers in hospitals to predict and enhance the status of their patients. Finally to observe the effectiveness of using feature selections, using k-fold cross-validation we assess a proposed model in the two experiments. We found that prediction scores such as accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, recall, true negative rate, and F1 score of K-NN with ReliefF AttributeEval is better than other algorithm of feature selection. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Proposed Model for Prediction of COVID-19 Depend on K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:Iraq Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated existing problems associated with the high consumption of plastic products and their incorrect disposal, resulting in serious social, economic, and environmental problems The development of biodegradable packaging has been growing in recent years due to the demand for food safety and quality This work aimed to prepare PBAT active films loaded with cellulose nanofibers (CNF) embedded with cinnamon essential oil (EO) by the wire extension method The possible interactions between NC-EO-PBAT were investigated, and the results confirmed the EO presence that physically interacted with the PBAT matrix, altering the polymeric molecular conformations All films showed high thermal stability, being adequate for application in the food industry The films containing the modified-CNF showed a Fickian controlled diffusion, and the higher essential oil release was verified for lower filler contents The modified-CNF decreased the water vapor permeability due to the oil hydrophobic oil and good filler dispersion, which impacted the film's performance as packaging for strawberries The fruits packed in films with 0 5 wt% of modified-CNF have lower weight loss after 15 days of storage, better freshness preservation, and no fungal attack The results indicated that the developed films improved the strawberries' qualities and have antimicrobial properties against Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, offering a potential alternative to synthetic materials as food packaging","output":"Nanocellulose functionalized with cinnamon essential oil: A potential application in active biodegradable packaging for strawberry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic temporarily, yet significantly, reshuffled the position, functions and (mediated) constructions of cities and urban places. The national lockdown, implemented by Austria on 16 March 2020, turned cities overnight from centres of hybrid cultural, economic, social, political life and power to places where urban life(styles) were put on hold. This article begins by presenting first key results of a longitudinal study with young adults studying in educational institutions in the state of Tyrol through the harshest country-wide lockdown measures and their gradual withdrawal. We analyse how participants coped with the disruption of their urban lives and lifestyles and the strategies they employed to compensate. We highlight three main insights. First, participants who had originally migrated to the city from their (often rural) hometowns largely returned to join their families. From there, no longer being an object of physical experience, the city became a digitally imagined, constructed and communicated place, reiterating public discourses that condemned the city as a place where lockdown measures were breached, and the virus spread unchecked. Second, where possible and adapted to the affordances of digital media, students shifted their previous lifestyles to digital space as well as created innovative ways of socialising digitallythus producing alternative digital forms of urban lifestyles and digitally-mediated urban experiences. Third, during the lockdown period, the importance, use intensity as well as a variety of digital media peaked tremendously. This trend, however, was short-lived as yearned-for offline sociability largely returned to the city once measures were relaxed, leaving those in rural homes detached from their urban peers.","output":"City-Life No More?

The economic losses is associated with death loss and treatment costs, reduction of live weight gain, and reduction of productive life span, which may be considerable. The aim of the present study was to identify relationships among APPs in calves with diarrhea in the different clinical features. Holstein calves (50) within 1 day to 4 months old with signs of diarrhea and healthy calves (40) with similar age and sex were selected. Standard clinical examinations and also dehydration degree were carried out on each calf and were recorded. Calves with clinical signs of diarrhea were divided in different groups based on the severity of the clinical findings, fever and degree of dehydration. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein from all calves into vacutainers containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for separating plasma and without EDTA for serum biochemical analysis. APP [haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen (Fib), and ceruloplasmin (Cp)] concentrations were measured using validated standard methods. The results indicated a significant increases in APPs in diarrheic calves which was most obvious in Hp and SAA (P < 0.001). Calves with severe clinical signs of diarrhea had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P < 0.001) compared to calves with moderate or without systemic clinical signs. Diarrheic calves with fever compared to diarrheic calves without fever had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P < 0.01).

As the 4th most populous country in the world, contact tracing in Indonesia is resource intensive. There was an insufficient human resources to undertake the reporting task with surveillance staff already overburdened with sample and data collection. Participation of various stakeholders is critical in providing an effective capacity surge in tracing. This paper describes how multi-sectoral collaboration training can contribute to accelerate contact tracing capacity in Indonesia. Methods & Materials A series of contact tracing training program in Indonesia was held through the various stakeholder collaboration, including the Ministry of Health, COVID-19 National Task Force, Ministry of Education and Culture, Universities, and international partners. Not only primary healthcare officers, the training engaged community volunteers, young professional, and university students to enable them performing COVID-19 contact tracing and data management across Indonesia. Descriptive statistics and paired t-test analysis were taken to measure the effectiveness of the pre- and post-test training, and evaluation questionnaires to improve participants knowledge. Results A total of 2,513 community volunteers and young professional from 10 provinces and 2,005 university students from 268 universities across Indonesia have been trained from January - July 2021. 4 batches of trainings have produced 64 data managers in all 34 provinces. At the beginning of the training, only 33% of participants reached satisfactory score. Post-training scores increased significantly to 66% participants reached satisfactory score with p-value = 0.000 (CI: 95%). 82% participants rated the effectiveness of training as good, and 90% stated that the training responded to their needs. The training has successfully increased the number of tracers in Indonesia as and improved the national tracing data collection. Surveillance data showed that from January to July 2021, the national tracing data has increased from 261,482 to 785.711 COVID-19 close contact traced. Conclusion Multi-sectoral participation and collaborative contact tracing training has helped the Government of Indonesia to increase human resource numbers and capacity in providing an effective capacity surge of tracing for the country. This will enable to support COVID-19 mitigation and intervention program and policy.","output":"Accelerating COVID-19 Contact Tracing Capacity through Multi-Sectoral Collaboration Training in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder where misfolded alpha-synuclein-enriched aggregates called Lewy bodies are central in pathogenesis.

However, these procedures have not yet been directly compared regarding their effectiveness and mechanisms of action. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of avoidance vs. inhibitory training as an add-on to a brief smoking cessation intervention. The standard Approach-Avoidance-Task (AAT) was adapted for both training types and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four smokers attended behavioral counseling for smoking cessation and were thereafter randomized to one of four training conditions: avoidance-AAT, sham-avoidance-AAT, inhibition-AAT, sham-inhibition-AAT. During a 2-week training period including five training sessions, smokers in the avoidance-AAT trained to implicitly avoid all smoking-related cues, while smokers in the inhibition-AAT trained to implicitly inhibit behavioral response to smoking cues. During sham training, no such contingencies appeared. Self-report and behavioral data were assessed before and after training. Cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence were also assessed at 4- and 12-week follow-ups. RESULTS: At posttest, avoidance training was more effective in reducing daily smoking than inhibition training. However, this difference was no longer evident in follow-up assessments. All training conditions improved other smoking- and health-related outcomes. Neither training changed smoking-related approach biases or associations, but approach biases for smoking-unrelated pictures increased and Stroop interference decreased in all conditions. Smoking devaluation was also comparable in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance training might be slightly more effective in reducing smoking than inhibitory training. Overall, however, all four training types yielded equivalent therapy and training effects. Hence, a clear preference for one type of training remains premature.

This study aimed to build the link between functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained before the stress event and the subsequent stress-related depressive symptoms. METHODS: Neuroimaging data obtained before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from 39 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 61 health controls (HCs) were used in this study. The participants were divided retrospectively into four groups in accordance with the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic: remitted patients, non-remitted patients, depressed HCs (HCd) and non-depressed HCs (HCnd). Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses of the amygdala and its subregions, including the centromedial (CM), the basolateral and the superficial (SF), were performed. RESULTS: Vulnerability to depression was suggested by decreased rsFC between the left CM amygdala and the bilateral lingual gyrus in the HCd group compared with the HCnd group, and decreased rsFC of the left CM or right SF amygdala with the precuneus and the postcentral gyrus in the HCd group compared with patients with MDD. No evidence supported the rsFC of the amygdala or its subregions as a biomarker for the resilience of patients with MDD to stress under antidepressant treatment. LIMITATIONS: Smaller sample size and no longitudinal neuroimaging data.

The 45S and 5S rRNA genes are independent and localized at one or more loci per the chromosome complement, their positions along chromosomes offer useful markers for chromosome discriminations. In the current study FISH has been performed to locate 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the chromosomes of nine Lathyrus species belong to five different sections, all have chromosome number 2n=14, Lathyrus gorgoni Parl, Lathyrus hirsutus L., Lathyrus amphicarpos L., Lathyrus odoratus L., Lathyrus sphaericus Retz, Lathyrus incospicuus L, Lathyrus paranensis Burkart, Lathyrus nissolia L., and Lathyrus articulates L. RESULTS: The revealed loci of 45S and 5S rDNA by FISH on metaphase chromosomes of the examined species were as follow: all of the studied species have one 45S rDNA locus and one 5S rDNA locus except L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L. and L. sphaericus Retz L. have two loci of 5S rDNA. Three out of the nine examined species have the loci of 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the opposite arms of the same chromosome (L. nissolia L., L. amphicarpos L., and L. incospicuus L.), while L. hirsutus L. has both loci on the same chromosome arm. The other five species showed the loci of the two types of rDNA on different chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The detected 5S and 45S rDNA loci in Lathyrus could be used as chromosomal markers to discriminate the chromosome pairs of the examined species. FISH could discriminate only one chromosome pair out of the seven pairs in three species, in L. hirsutus L., L. nissolia L. and L. incospicuus L., and two chromosome pairs in five species, in L. paranensis Burkart, L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L., L. gorgoni Parl. and L. articulatus L., while it could discriminate three chromosome pairs in L. sphaericus Retz. these results could contribute into the physical genome mapping of Lathyrus species and the evolution of rDNA patterns by FISH in the coming studies in future.","output":"Ribosomal DNA localization on Lathyrus species chromosomes by FISH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study presents an unusual case of a patient with a personal history of a rectal malignant tumor in 2013, who after a period of 6 years, was diagnosed with an advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, locally and regionally invasive.

Although molecular identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the gold standard method, its low sensitivity and long turnaround time are among major concerns. In this retrospective single-center study, we reviewed the results of the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts of 1450 Iranian patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recruited at Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Of 1450 patients, 439 cases (30.3%) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative;further emphasizing that getting negative molecular testing is not as reliable as a positive result. While the lymphocyte count in cases with less than 50 years old was 1.8x103/microL (1.2-2.5), it was 1.47x103/microL (0.84-2.16) in the older group (p&lt;0.001). Also, men experienced lower lymphocytes as compared to women (1.53x103/microL vs 1.76x103/microL;p=0.002). Of particular interest, the lymphocyte count in the PCR-negative cases was 1.77x103/microL (0.98-2.45) which was significantly higher than its count in their positive counterparts (1.53x103/microL;p=0.004). Unlike lymphocytes, sex and PCR did not significantly affect the number of neutrophils. The odds ratio for neutrophilia in patients aged older than 50, either with a negative or a positive PCR, was 2.46 and 2.23, suggesting old age as the most significant associated factor. The number of lymphocytes along with increased neutrophil count may probably serve as simple, rapid, and economical biomarkers, and are seemingly appropriate items that should be taken into account in the identification of patients with COVID-19, especially those aged more than 50.","output":"The Association of Age, Sex, and RT-PCR Results with the Lymphocyte and Neutrophil Counts in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Cross-sectional Analysis of 1450 Iranian Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Recent decades have witnessed a tremendous shift from laparotomy to laparoscopy as the surgical approach of choice in gynecology.

The values of Cronbach's  and composite reliability were above .70 for all HLQ scales. The CFA analyses showed that all HLQ scales meet the criteria that were set a priori: RMSEA .07, CFI .95, and Chisq/df < 5. In addition, all standardized factor loadings were above .50. Regarding the measurement invariance, the results supported the equal form measurement invariance for all HLQ scales. The equality of factor loadings measurement invariance across gender was also supported for all HLQ scales.

Sustainability issues greatly intensify social problems. As well as food loss (FL), food waste (FW), and sustainability concerns, obesity, and malnutrition are enhanced due to the lack of knowledge by the population. Processed food (PF), packaging, and additives, despite still needing improvement, are essential to food security control.

The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in recurrent varicose veins of the SSV and to compare this technique with surgical reintervention. METHODS All case files of patients treated for SSV varicosities between May 2006 and October 2008 were evaluated and recurrences were selected. Demographics, duplex findings, clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathological classification, perioperative and follow-up data were all registered. Additionally, a questionnaire focusing on patient satisfaction was taken. RESULTS Two hundred and eighty-one patients were treated for varicosities of the SSV, of which 42 were for recurrences. Twenty-six of these were treated with EVLA, all under local anaesthesia, and 16 were surgically treated. Most surgically treated patients were treated under regional anaesthesia (88%). Technical success was achieved in 94% of surgically treated patients and in all EVLA-treated patients. Complications in both groups were mostly minor and self-limiting. Sural nerve neuralgia appeared to be more frequent in the surgically treated group (20% versus 9%). After correction for length of follow-up, the incidence of rerecurrences was not statistically significant between groups.

Methods: The EXPLORE XLRP 1 survey interviewed RS (n=20) and geneticists (n=5) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK) to record information about healthcare pathways and diagnostic approaches for patients with XLRP (n=80). Results: Patients (mostly male [91%] and aged 18C40 years [57%]) experienced an average time of 4 years between XLRP symptoms and diagnosis. In France, Spain, and Italy, patient pathways are linear: most patients see RS/geneticists by ophthalmologist referral. In Germany and the UK, patients see RS/geneticists through multiple routes, also including general practitioner and optometrist referrals. Genetic testing was used as part of XLRP diagnosis in 78% of patients. Genetic testing usually took >6 weeks to receive results, and some patients waited up to 6 months. Genetic testing was fully reimbursed for most patients, except those in Spain, where patients largely incurred the full cost. In the UK, testing costs were co-paid by 14% of patients. Despite barriers to genetic testing (e.g., costs, long waiting times for results), physicians agreed that genotypic diagnosis is helpful to predict disease progression and to enable patient involvement in clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the frequency of in-person clinic visits, but some physicians utilized tele-consultation and remote patient management. Conclusions: The pathways by which patients with XLRP in Europe visit RS and geneticists are complex, lengthy, and vary considerably by country. This survey reported high usage of genetic testing to confirm XLRP diagnosis, but long waiting times for test results accounts for incomplete uptake, especially among older patients.

RESULTS: Total parental earned income was moderately correlated with adolescents scoring on FAS (0.31 < r < 0.48, p < 0.001), depending on examination year. The low FAS group mainly comprised low-income households, and the high FAS group mainly comprised high-income households. Correlations between mothers and fathers educational level and adolescents scoring on FAS were low (r = 0.19 and r = 0.21, respectively, p < 0.001). FAS was higher among adolescents whose parents were working, but the correlation between parents occupational status and FAS was low (r = 0.22, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FAS can mainly identify low- and high-income households in Sweden. It may be used as an alternative measure of parental earned income in studies using self-reported socioeconomic status among adolescents.","output":"Does the family affluence scale reflect actual parental earned income, level of education and occupational status?

Its main reason is lack of a bigger study to analyse this question. The evidence of the affection of the foetus during antenatal or intrapartum period is limited to some anecdotal reports. To look for the possibility of vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome C Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to the foetus, this prospective pilot study was conducted at a tertiary health care COVID-19 designated centre of Armed Forces. METHODS: This study was conducted during 01 June 2020 and 15 October 2020 and included 54 covid-positive pregnant mothers. During delivery, amniotic fluid and cord blood samples were collected in a sterile manner. Amniotic fluid samples were not collected during vaginal deliveries as chances of contamination was very high. These samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 gene by Reverse Transcriptasee Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, and the results were analysed. Newborns were allowed to room in with mother, and they underwent throat and nasal swab RT-PCR testing of covid within 24C48 h of delivery. RESULTS: A total of 1520 pregnant mothers underwent RT-PCR test during the study period. Total positivity rate among our pregnant women was 2.8%. Out of 54 covid-positive women during the study period, amniotic fluid RT-PCR tests were carried out for 43 women, and cord blood was tested for 45 women. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR test of amniotic fluid, cord blood and nasal and throat swab of all newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were negative. Based on our study, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be unlikely.","output":"Assessment of materno-foetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A prospective pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Compared to adults, there are relatively few studies on COVID-19 infection in children, and even less focusing on the unique features of COVID-19 in children in terms of laboratory findings, locations of computerized tomography (CT) lesions, and the role of CT in evaluating clinical recovery. The objective of this study is to report the results from patients at Wuhan Childrens Hospital, located within the initial center of the outbreak. METHODS: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Cox regression statistical methods. RESULTS: Among 50 children with a positive COVID-19 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five had negative PCR results initially but showed positive results in subsequent tests. Eight (16%) patients had lymphopenia, seven (14%) with thrombocytopenia, four (8%) with lymphocytosis, two (4%) with thrombocytosis, ten (20%) with elevated C-reactive protein, four (8%) with hemoglobin above, and six (12%) with below standard reference values. Seven (14%) of the 50 had no radiologic evidence of disease on chest CT. For the 43 patients who had abnormal CT findings, in addition to previously reported patterns of ground-glass opacity (67%), local patchy shadowing (37%), local bilateral patchy shadowing (21%), and lesion location of lower lobes (65%), other CT features include that an overwhelming number of pediatric patients had lesions in the subpleural area (95%) and 22 of the 28 lower lobe lesions were in the posterior segment (78%). Lesions in most of the 15 patients (67%) who received chest CT at discharge were not completely absorbed, and 26% of these pediatric patients had CT lesions that were either unchanged or worse. CONCLUSIONS: There were a few differences between COVID-19 children and COVID-19 adults in terms of laboratory findings and CT characteristics. CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children. These results oppose current COVID-19 hospital discharge criteria in China, as one requirement is that pulmonary imaging must show significant lesion absorption prior to discharge. These differences between pediatric and adult cases of COVID-19 may necessitate pediatric-specific discharge criteria.","output":"A single-center, retrospective study of COVID-19 features in children: a descriptive investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health restrictions such as social distancing, isolation and self-quarantine have been implemented for several months. Because of these restrictions, in-person contact with friends, family, and mental health supports had been limited, potentially impacting mental wellbeing. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of adults and investigated the types of activities people engage in to manage and maintain their mental health. METHODS: An online survey was circulated in Canada and had a total of 221 participants from September 24 to December 8, 2020. RESULTS: The majority of participants were females (73.2%), between the ages of 18 and 34 (51.1%), and employed full-time (56.1%). Individuals who are unemployed and those with an annual income less than $25,000 had the highest scores in depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Around 19.4% of the sample scored above the cutpoint for depression, which is higher compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 4.7%. Similarly, higher prevalence of anxiety and distress symptoms were observed: 16.3% of the sample had moderate anxiety symptoms compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 11.6%; and 37.7% of the sample had moderate distress symptoms compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 20%.

Because the degree of rise in the number of patient roles is directly related to the rate of people growth and lifestyle variations, the healthcare sector has a significant need for data processing services. When it comes to cancer, the prognosis is an expression that relates to the possibility of the patient surviving in general, but it may also be used to describe the severity of the sickness as it will present itself in the patient's future timeline. Methodology. The proposed technique consists of three stages: input data acquisition, preprocessing, and classification. Data acquisition consists of input raw data which is followed by preprocessing to eliminate the missed data and the classification is carried out using ensemble classifier to analyze the stages of cancer. This study explored the combined influence of the prominent labels in conjunction with one another utilizing the multilabel classifier approach, which is successful. Finally, an ensemble classifier model has been constructed and experimentally validated to increase the accuracy of the classifier model, which has been previously shown. The entire performance of the recommended and tested models demonstrates a steady development of 2% to 6% over the baseline presentation on the baseline performance.

It is likely that lockdown restrictions enforced by the UK government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent changes made to healthcare provisions, could impact patients abilities to effectively manage their condition. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on self-management behaviours and healthcare provision in people with IA. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 patients with IA from across the UK (as part of a larger longitudinal survey study exploring the impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life for people with IA). Participants who gave consent for contact, following the completion of the baseline survey study, were approached to take part in the qualitative interviews. The interview schedule was developed with a Patient Research Partner and consisted of eight main questions to explore participants experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of COVID-19 on their self-management behaviours and access to healthcare services. The interviews were conducted via telephone and were recorded and transcribed before being analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results Participants were aged between 24-72 (mean age 50.0, SD 15.6) and were mostly female (71%) and White British (86%). Four main themes were identified: impact of COVID-19 on medication adherence, impact of COVID-19 on physical activity, impact of COVID-19 on diet, and impact of COVID-19 on healthcare access. Subthemes focused on positive and negative changes made to these areas, as well as behaviours which remained consistent. Some participants expressed that the lockdown period had enabled them to increase their physical activity, improve their diet and maintain their usual medication regimen, whilst others noted that lockdown had had a negative impact on their self-management behaviours. For example, some patients decided to discontinue their medication during the pandemic due to concerns that it would make them more susceptible to severe consequences from COVID-19. In relation to healthcare provision, the most commonly reported change was the introduction of telephone appointments to replace face-to-face consultations. Several patients found the telephone appointments ineffective, especially if their disease was relatively uncontrolled. Nevertheless, participants understood why a remote approach had been implemented during the pandemic. Conclusion COVID-19 has had an impact on patients abilities to manage their IA.

Evidence is lacking on the effects of online contraceptive service use on short-term contraceptive continuation. METHODS: Cohort study comparing contraceptive continuation between new users of a free-to-access online OC service in South East London with those from other, face-to-face services in the same area. Online questionnaires collected data on participants sociodemographic characteristics, motivations for OC access, service ratings, OC knowledge and contraceptive use. Contraceptive use in the 4-month study period was measured using health service records. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models compared outcomes between the online service group and those using other services. RESULTS: Online service-users (n=138) were more likely to experience short-term continuation of OCs compared with participants using other services (n=98) after adjusting for sociodemographic and other characteristics (adjusted OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.70). Online service-users rated their service more highly (mean 25.22, SD 3.77) than the other services group (mean 22.70, SD 4.35; p<0.001), valuing convenience and speed of access.

Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning.

METHODS: This multicenter observational cohort study included patients admitted with COVID-19 between March - May 2020 in Detroit, Michigan who received at least 2 doses of HCQ. Our primary outcome was the change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from presentation to day 5 of HCQ therapy with a secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality. Data collected included demographics, Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), daily SOFA score, laboratory data and COVID-directed therapies. Multiple linear regressions were performed to control for potential confounders between different therapies and change in SOFA score. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-five patients receiving HCQ were included. Patients were 62  14.8 years of age, male (54%) and African-American (82%) with a mean CCI of 1.7  1.9. In our cohort, 32% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 35% expired. Therapies received by more than 20% of patients in addition to HCQ included azithromycin (80%), zinc (76%) and vitamin D (29%). In our unadjusted analysis, a significant improvement in SOFA score was observed with zinc (0.76) while no significant change was observed with azithromycin (-0.46) or vitamin D (0.05). However, there was no significant change in SOFA score after adjusting for confounders for azithromycin, zinc and vitamin D. No difference in mortality was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, no benefit in end-organ damage or mortality was observed with the addition of azithromycin, zinc or vitamin D to HCQ. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation.

Analysis of cell type-specific aging-associated transcriptional changes revealed increased systemic inflammation and compromised virus defense as a hallmark of cardiopulmonary aging. With age, expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was increased in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial barrier, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. We found that interleukin 7 (IL7) accumulated in aged cardiopulmonary tissues and induced ACE2 expression in human vascular endothelial cells in an NF-&#954;B-dependent manner.

In the lack of a specific treatment and vaccine for this novel infection, finding effective drugs against this infection is crucial.

Instead, it takes the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), and the appearance of an exchange gap to unlock hidden quantum states. The quantum anomalous Hall effect, which has first been observed in Cr-doped (Sb,Bi)$_2$Te$_3$, is an example of such a state in which two edge channels are formed at zero field, crossing the magnetic exchange gap. The breaking of TRS can be achieved by magnetic doping of the TI with transition metal or rare earth ions, modulation doping to keep the electronically active channel impurity free, or by proximity coupling to a magnetically ordered layer or substrate, in heterostructures or superlattices.

Methods Blood RBD-IgG (IgG II Quant assay, Abbott Diagnostics; upper limit: 5680 BAU) and nucleocapsid-IgG (Abbott Alinity) were measured 21-28 days after the second BNT162b2 dose, as well as 1-3 days before and 21-28 days after the third vaccine dose.

The conformation equilibrium between open (up) and closed (down) conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike is studied from the first-principle. The conformational state population is deduced from the free energy change in conformation transition of S protein. We demonstrated that the free energy includes two parts, one from the multi-minima of conformational potential and another from the variation of structural elasticity. Both factors are dependent of amino acid mutation. The former is related to the change of affinity of RBD to ACE 2 due to the mutation in the subdomain RBM (receptor binding motif) of RBD. The latter is caused by the change of elastic energy of S protein. When the affinity has increased significantly and/or the elastic energy has been reduced substantially the equilibrium is biased to the open conformation. Only then can the virus infection process continue. Possible new SARS-CoV-2 variants from amino acid mutations in 5-9 sites on RBD interface are predicted. The elastic energy variation needed for conformation transition is estimated quantitatively. Taking the elastic-structural change into account more virus variants are possible. Both the D614G mutation, the K986P mutation and the new variants 501Y in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be interpreted from the presented theory. The comparison of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-1 is made from the point of conformation equilibrium.

We aimed to systematically review up-to-date evidence regarding feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of CA, with a specific focus on long-term relapse rate and procedural complications. METHODS: A structured electronic database search (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane) of the scientific literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines for studies describing outcomes at up to 7.3 years after CA. The primary outcome measured was VT recurrence post-ablation. Procedural success was defined as freedom of ventricular arrhythmias (at the end of follow-up after an ablation procedure). The secondary outcome was significant procedural complications which included procedural death, stroke, cardiac tamponade, acute myocardial infarction, major vascular complications, and major bleeding, assessed on a study-by-study basis. RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were included in analysis with most patients (88%) being male. Over the follow-up period, there was a 18% relapse rate (n = 34) (confidence interval (CI); 0.12C0.24, I(2)0, p = 0.77) with the majority of patients remaining VT free for the duration of follow-up. The overall procedural complication rate was 3.0% (n = 7) (CI; 0.01C0.07, I(2)0, p = 0.44), and of note, there were no peri-procedural deaths or heart transplant surgeries reported.

We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with both RF time-series images and the spectrograms of 15 different off-the-shelf drone controller RF signals. When using time-series signal images, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As the SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in the transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In contrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it is possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM band, and filter out any other signal component outside of this band. These advantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series signals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the spectrogram-based CNN, we denoise the spectrogram images by truncating them to a limited spectral density interval. Creating a single model using spectrogram images of noisy signals and tuning the CNN model parameters, we achieve a classification accuracy varying from 92% to 100% for an SNR range from -10 dB to 30 dB, which significantly outperforms the existing approaches to our best knowledge.","output":"RF-Based Low-SNR Classification of UAVs Using Convolutional Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only affects the respiratory tract but also causes neurological symptoms such as loss of smell and taste, headache, fatigue or severe cerebrovascular complications.

Therefore, there are two main priorities: the development of preventive vaccines to protect from HIV acquisition and achieve an efficient control of HIV infection in the absence of ART (functional cure). In this sense, in the last few years, there has been a broad interest in new and innovative approaches such as mRNA-based vaccines. RNA-based immunogens represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccines because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration. Some mRNA-based vaccines platforms against infectious diseases have demonstrated encouraging results in animal models and humans.

Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy.","output":"Evaluation of deep learning approaches for identification of different corona-virus species and time series prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In one of his papers, Moti Mizrahi argues that arguments from an expert opinion are weak arguments. His thesis may seem controversial due to the consensus on this topic in the field of informal logic. I argue that its controversy is framework-dependent, and if translated into a different framework, it appears to be a correct, however trivial, claim. I will use a framework based on Douglas Waltons argumentation scheme theory and his conception of examination dialogue to demonstrate that it is so. It appears that Mizrahis idiosyncratic framework provides an excessively restrictive conception of an argument from expert opinion than Waltons scheme does. There is no quarrel between both frameworks, as they yield analogous, almost identical, outcomes of argument evaluation. The actual and crucial disagreement is on the topic of argument classification. Mizrahis conception of arguments from an expert opinion imposes exact conditions that such argument must fulfil: an experts opinion o truth-value must be unknown; o must be unsupported by any evidence; an experts peers neither accept o nor reject it. These exclude, by definition, every possible strong, in Waltons terms, variant of such an argument.

This has implications for ED resources and raises questions about appropriate assessment location for this group. AIMS: This report aims to examine the impact of removal of a direct community access point for patients in acute mental health need on ED presentations in a Dublin hospital. METHODS: We examined data on ED referrals to psychiatry over 5 years: 12 months before the service change, and four subsequent 12-month periods. We compared numbers referred, mode of referral, average ED length of stay, proportion with no physical issue requiring psychiatric assessment only, and numbers who did not wait for psychiatry assessment. RESULTS: In the year directly after the service change, referrals to psychiatry from ED increased by 200%, remaining at this level for the subsequent 3 years. Of these, 32.5% were referred by a GPmore than a threefold increase in numbers from the previous year, with both numbers remaining similarly elevated over subsequent years. In the year after the service change, 52.1% of total ED to psychiatry presented solely for mental health reasonsnearly a fourfold increase in cases from the previous year, and remained high.

In March 2020 in the UK this move was sudden, and universities were forced to move their provision to digital formats with little preparatory time, and in many cases, inadequate training and experience. In the subsequent period, higher education institutions have prioritised the enhancement of digital education, with a range of strategic initiatives and training programmes for teaching staff. This paper, written by a staff-student partnership of authors, reports on two institutionally-supported studies conducted at a large, research-focused university in England, in which student views were sought on their experiences and priorities surrounding online engagement during the COVID-19 crisis. In our discussion of the findings, we argue that the student accounts challenge some of the mainstream assumptions about constructs such as student 'inclusivity', academic 'community' online, and teaching which encourages 'questioning', requiring us to think more deeply about what constitutes a meaningful and rich online educative experience. In the spirit of 'lessons learned' from the COVID-19 pandemic, the paper proposes alternative conceptions of these values, emphasising relationality, communities, difference, and the importance of an ethos of care. We conclude with a discussion of findings, implications for theory, research, policy and practice in a post-pandemic context, proposing that an ethos of care be recognised as central to the development of digital education and the practices and ethics of student engagement.","output":"'Engagement' Discourses and the Student Voice: Connectedness, Questioning and Inclusion in Post-COVID Digital Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a context specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis.","output":"ViralLink: An integrated workflow to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on intracellular signalling and regulatory pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health futures are not preordained, nor are they entirely predictable by extrapolation from the past.

One Nature also recognizes animal sentience and agency of nonhuman animals. In doing so, the One Nature governance frame places a firm emphasis on the internal levers of social change and the human values essential to cultivate collective action to curb unchecked extraction of nature that placed human societies in harm's way for future health crises. One Nature is a governance frame and reflexive value system that can be transformative to correct the astigmatism we have long suffered, from the ways in which we have conceived, enacted on, and extracted the natural systems over the centuries.

Despite the paucity of literature on Antimicrobial Stewardship and COVID-19, the potential contributions of ASPs during a pandemic are numerous. ASPs can develop strategies to identify patients with COVID-19-like-illness; this is particularly useful when these patients are missed at the time of health system entry. ASPs can also play a critical role in the management of potential drug shortages, developing local treatment guidelines, optimizing the use of antibiotics, and in the diagnostic stewardship of COVID-19 testing, among other roles. Importantly, it is often difficult to ascertain whether critically ill patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have concurrent or secondary bacterial infectionsASPs are ideally situated to help optimize antimicrobial use for these patients via a variety of mechanisms. ASPs are uniquely positioned to aid in pandemic response planning and relief efforts. ASPs are already integrated into health systems and play a key role in optimizing antimicrobial prescribing.

We hypothesized OPEP would improve students attitudes towards psychiatry, and positive changes would be sustained 2C3 years later following their residency match. We hypothesized there would be a high recruitment of OPEP attendees to psychiatry programs. METHODS: 1st and 2nd year medical students from Canada applied to OPEP. Attendees completed the Attitudes Towards Psychiatry Questionnaire (ATP-30) at three times: before OPEP (PreOPEP), after OPEP (PostOPEP) and after their Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMs) match 2C3 years later. OPEP ATP-30 scores were compared to third-year student ATP-30 scores before and after their psychiatry rotation. Data were analysed using Friedman non-parametric ANOVA and post hoc testing by either Wilcoxon rank sum test, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, or parametric Welch independent t-test as appropriate. Effect sizes of group mean differences were calculated using Cohens d. RESULTS: Between 2017C2018, 29/53 Canadian applicants were selected for OPEP. 100%, 93.1% and 75.8% of OPEP students completed the PreOPEP, PostOPEP, and CaRMs ATP-30 surveys respectively. 43% of OPEP attendees matched to psychiatry.

However, little is known about the SDL resources medical students use. This study aimed to identify patterns in medical students SDL behaviors, their SDL resource choices, factors motivating these choices, and the potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on these variables. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey comprising multiple-choice, ranked, and free-text response questions were disseminated to medical students across all 41 UK medical schools between April and July 2020. Independent study hours and sources of study materials prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared. Motivational factors guiding resource choices and awareness of Free Open Access Meducation were also investigated. RESULTS: The target sample was 75 students per medical school across a total of 41 medical schools within the United Kingdom (3,075 total students), and 1,564 responses were analyzed. University-provided information comprised the most commonly used component of independent study time, but a minority of total independent study time. Independent study time increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (P<0.001). All sub-cohorts except males reported a significant increase in the use of resources such as free websites and question banks (P<0.05) and paid websites (P<0.05) as a result of the pandemic. Accessibility was the most influential factor guiding resource choice (Friedmans rank=3.97, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of learning resources independent of university provision is increasing. Educators must ensure equitable access to such materials while supporting students in making informed choices regarding their independent study behaviors.","output":"Medical students pattern of self-directed learning prior to and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic period and its implications for Free Open Access Meducation within the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has recently been taken hold of worldwide and caused thousands of people death Although COVID-19 is not a food-borne outbreak, foods can mediate the spread of COVID-19 Thus, prevention of contamination of foods with COVID-19 or inactivation of the virus from contaminated foods could be provided by ensuring good hygiene practices in food establishments, being careful in personnel hygiene, washing fruit and vegetables with plenty of water before processing and consumption, cooking foods at proper temperatures and avoid crosscontamination Ethanol ( 70%), NaClO (0 1%), Hsub2/subOsub2/sub and quaternary ammonium compounds are suggested as disinfectants to inhibit COVID-19 In this study, information has been reviewed about the spread of COVID-19 through foods, making foods safe in terms of COVID-19, measures to be taken against COVID-19 in food establishments during production, transportation, service and selling stages and disinfectants that can be used in food premises for this purpose","output":"Precautions to be taken against COVID-19 pandemic in food establishments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is one of the unprecedented global crises that hit mankind in the last 100 years It has engulfed the entire globe in its ambit, and what makes it peculiar is that it is not an economic crisis like the Great Depression or the Financial Crisis in 2007, but this is a natural crisis The crisis has brought the entire global economy to a standstill due to lockdowns across different geographies, which has retarded the growth of economies The current study explores how different major stock markets across the world have reacted to this grave pandemic It is studied by comparing the returns of different phases of the market with the normal phase by applying T-test and Mann?Whitney U-test Results indicate the short-term impact of this epidemic and much faster recoveries across different markets The study also explores the spillover effect of different markets over others","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Major Stock Markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the global outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a significant reduction in pediatric outpatient and emergency visits for infectious diseases. The purpose of this study was to analyze the changes in respiratory viruses in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Shanghai in the past 10 years, especially in the first year after COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study; the results for eight common respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1C3 (PIV), adenovirus (ADV) and human metapneumovirus) tested by direct fluorescent antibody assays in hospitalized CAP cases in Childrens Hospital of Fudan University during 2010C2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 5544 hospitalized CAP patients included in this study, 20.2% (1125/5544) were positive for the eight respiratory viruses. The top three pathogens were RSV, PIV3 and ADV, detected from 9.8% (543/5544), 5.3% (294/5544) and 2.0% (111/5544) of the samples, respectively. RSV had the highest positive rates among children < 2 years old. In 2020, the detection rate of all viruses showed a sharp decline from February to August compared with the previous 9 years. When the Shanghai community reopened in August 2020, the detection rate of eight viruses rebounded significantly in September. CONCLUSIONS: These eight respiratory viruses, especially RSV and PIV, were important pathogens of CAP in Shanghai children in the past 10 years.

Despite efforts by the health care sector to develop health system solutions to improve transitions, problems persist. Research on transitional support has predominantly focused on services delivered by health care professionals; the evidence for services provided by lay navigators or volunteers in supporting people transitioning from hospital to home has not been synthesized to guide practice, policy or future research. Aim: This is a protocol for a scoping review that will examine the role and contributions of voluntary sector personnel and services to support transitions from hospital to home. Methods: Using the well-established scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and OMalley a six-stage study is outlined (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting the data, (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and (6) providing consultation. The search strategy, designed by an information scientist, is applied to ten databases reflecting empirical and grey literature sources. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine eligibility of articles. To be included in the review, articles must report on a community-based program that engages volunteers in the provisions of services that support adults transitioning from hospital to home. All articles will be independently assessed for eligibility, and data from eligible articles will be abstracted and charted using a standardized form. Extracted data will be analyzed using narrative and descriptive analyses. Research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review.

K777, an irreversible, covalent inactivator of cysteine proteases that has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity in several host cells: Vero E6 (EC(50)< 74 nM), HeLa/ACE2 (4 nM), Caco-2 (EC(90) = 4.3 M), and A549/ACE2 (<80 nM). Infectivity of Calu-3 cells depended on the cell line assayed. If Calu-3/2B4 was used, EC(50) was 7 nM, but in the ATCC Calu-3 cell line without ACE2 enrichment, EC(50) was >10 M. There was no toxicity to any of the host cell lines at 10C100 M K777 concentration. Kinetic analysis confirmed that K777 was a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L, whereas no inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine proteases (papain-like and 3CL-like protease) was observed. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe identified human cathepsin B and cathepsin L as the intracellular targets of this molecule in both infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. However, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was only carried out by cathepsin L. This cleavage was blocked by K777 and occurred in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a different site from that previously observed for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of cathepsin L-mediated viral spike protein processing.","output":"A Clinical-Stage Cysteine Protease Inhibitor blocks SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Human and Monkey Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effects of cardiometabolic drugs on the prognosis of diabetic patients with COVID-19, especially very old patients, are not well known. This work was aimed to analyze the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy (antidiabetic, antiaggregant, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs) and in-hospital mortality among patients &#8805;80 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) hospitalized for COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, observational study in patients &#8805;80 years with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 29, 2020. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 2 763 patients &#8805;80 years old hospitalized due to COVID-19, 790 (28.6%) had T2DM. Of these patients, 385 (48.7%) died during admission. On the multivariate analysis, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.502, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.309-0.815, p = .005) and angiotensin receptor blockers (AOR 0.454, 95% CI: 0.274-0.759, p = .003) were independent protectors against in-hospital mortality, whereas the use of acetylsalicylic acid was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.761, 95% CI: 1.092-2.842, p = .020). Other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins showed neutral association with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We found important differences between cardiometabolic drugs and in-hospital mortality in older patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. Preadmission treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could reduce in-hospital mortality; other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins seem to have a neutral effect; and acetylsalicylic acid could be associated with excess mortality.","output":"Cardiometabolic Therapy and Mortality in Very Old Patients With Diabetes Hospitalized due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a primary characteristic of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

However, whether this effect of MAT is through protecting the integrity and function of the BBB is not known.

Furthermore, MAT treatment attenuated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2 (MMP-9/-2), while it increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 (TIMP-1/-2). Our findings demonstrate that MAT reduces BBB leakage by strengthening basement membrane, inhibiting activities of MMP-2 and -9, and upregulating their inhibitors.

It is hypothesized the epidemic is differentially progressing in different countries. AIM: To investigate how the COVID-19 epidemic is going on in different countries by analyzing representative countries. METHODS: The status of COVID-19 epidemic in over 60 most affected countries was characterized. The data of daily new cases of each country were collected from Worldometer. The data of daily tests for the United States, Italy, and South Korea were collected from the Website of One World Data. Levels of daily positive COVID-19 tests in the two most affected states of the United States (New York and New Jersey) were collected from the website of the COVID Tracking Project. Statistics were analyzed using Microcal Origin software with ANOVA algorithm, and significance level was set at a P value of 0.05. RESULTS: The COVID-19 epidemic was differentially progressing in different countries. Comparative analyses of daily new cases as of April 19, 2020 revealed that 61 most affected countries can be classified into four types: Downward (22), upward (20), static-phase (12), and uncertain ones (7). In particular, the 12 static-phase countries including the United States were characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 d. Furthermore, these static-phase countries were overall significantly lower in testing density (P = 0.016) but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries (P = 0.028). These findings suggested that the testing capacity in static-phase countries was lagging behind the spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) were likely less than daily new infections and the remaining undocumented infections were thus still expanding, resulting in unstoppable epidemic. CONCLUSION: Increasing the testing capacity and/or reducing the COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the potentially unstoppable, severing crisis in static-phase countries.","output":"Global analysis of daily new COVID-19 cases reveals many static-phase countries including the United States potentially with unstoppable epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A human arm makes many functions that a robotic arm always programmed to make same functions.

Results: The number of patients sent for cerebrovascular disorders, headache, and vertigo significantly dropped between the pre-COVID-19 era and the lockdown period. While in the pre-COVID-19 group, the most frequent diagnosis was cerebrovascular disorder; neuropsychiatric disorders ranked first in the LOCKDOWN group. Moreover, the percentage of appropriate non-deferrable neurological evaluations significantly increased in the LOCKDOWN group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group. Discussion: Our study shows a significant increase of neuropsychiatric disorders in non-deferrable neurologic evaluations during the Italian second wave of the COVID-19.

The wide-ranging impact of sumoylation on cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, stress response, and cell cycle control makes it an attractive target for viral dysregulation. To date, proteins from both RNA and DNA virus families have been shown to be modified by SUMO conjugation, and this modification appears critical for viral protein function. More interestingly, members of the several viral families have been shown to modulate sumoylation, including papillomaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, filoviruses, and picornaviruses.

Eight socioeconomic indicators were identified and weighted using the methodology of two-phase principal component analysis, providing an index that allowed each census section to be classified into seven deprivation groups. Secondly, the possible relation between the IPID and the variables for multimorbidity and healthcare resources was analysed using the theory of multiple comparisons. It was observed that places with a greater proportion of healthy people presented lower values of deprivation and that, at lower levels of deprivation, there were fewer hospital admissions. The results show that living in an area with a higher deprivation index is associated with greater consumption of healthcare resources and disease burden.

Some of these are community acquired co-infections. OBJECTIVE: To review recent data which indicate the occurrence of hospital-onset bacterial infections, including with antibiotic-resistant isolates, in COVID-19 patients. SOURCES: Using PubMed, the literature was searched using terms including: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; bacterial infection; healthcare-associated infection; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial resistance; multi-drug resistance; Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; Pseudomonas; Escherichia; Klebsiella; Enterococcus; Acinetobacter; Haemophilus; MRSA; VRE; ESBL; NDM-CRE; CR-Ab; VRSA; MDR. CONTENT: There is a growing number of reports of bacterial infections acquired by patients with severe COVID-19 after hospital admission. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens found to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in COVID-19 patients include Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), New Delhi Metallo--lactamase-producing Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE), Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab), Extended-Spectrum -Lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE). COVID-19 has impacted bacterial HAIs in a number of ways with an increase in the incidence of NDM-CRE and CR-Ab reported at some hospital sites compared to before the pandemic. Recommended guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in COVID-19 patient treatment are discussed regarding minimisation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Other studies have reported a decrease in MRSA and VRE cases that has been attributed to enhanced infection prevention and control (IPC) practices introduced to minimise intra-hospital spread of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: Poorer outcomes have been observed in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with an antibiotic-resistant infection. While heightened IPC measures have been accompanied by a reduction in some HAIs at specific sites, in other situations, COVID-19 has been associated with an increase in bacterial HAI incidence. Further research is needed to define the cost-benefit relationship of maintaining COVID-19-related IPC protocols beyond the pandemic to reduce the burden of HAIs.

This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch.

METHODS: HCWs who were administered two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, 21 days apart, between December 2020 and January 2021, were invited to undergo multiple serology tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Participants also responded to questions about their smoking status (i.e. current smokers vs non-smokers) in a survey. RESULTS: Sixty days after the completion of the vaccination cycle, serological analyses showed a difference in vaccine-induced IgG titre between current smokers and non-smokers, with median antibody titres of 211.80 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 149.80C465.50) and 487.50 AU/mL (IQR 308.45C791.65) [P-value = 0.002], respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS: Adenoidectomy is indicated in children for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, nasal airway obstruction, recurrent acute otitis media, and chronic rhinosinusitis. A new recommendation was released in 2016, not supporting adenoidectomy for a primary indication of otitis media in children under 4 years old, including those with prior tympanostomy tubes, unless a distinct indication exists such as nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis. Although adenotonsillectomy is the mainstay of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recent studies have identified that non-obese patients with moderate OSA and small tonsils have comparable benefits with adenoidectomy alone with less complications. While conventional approaches such as indirect mirror-assisted curette and suction coagulation are still utilized, direct transnasal endoscope-assisted removal of the adenoids has proven to be a safe technique, with good short- and long-term outcomes. Novel non-surgical therapies including immunotherapy have been evaluated. SUMMARY: Adenoidectomy is a safe procedure in the pediatric population and leads to excellent outcomes. Adverse events are rare, and hospitalization is uncommon.

METHODS The validation, in addition to the evaluation of precision and accuracy, included the analysis of the effects of the main procedures that are currently being used for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in saliva and a pilot study to evaluate the possible changes in salivary tADA and isoenzymes in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The automated assay proved to be accurate and precise, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation below 8.2%, linearity under dilution linear regression with R2 close to 1, and recovery percentage between 80 and 120% in all cases. This assay was affected when the sample is treated with heat or SDS for virus inactivation but tolerated Triton X-100 and NP-40.

We provide a biochemical hypothesis for the connection between low COVID-19 incidence, mortality rates, and high visceral adiposity in Southeast Asian populations. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a gateway into the human body. Although the highest expression levels of ACE2 are found in peoples visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asia, this does not necessarily make them vulnerable to COVID-19. Hypothetically, high levels of visceral adiposity cause systemic inflammation, thus decreasing the ACE2 amount on the surface of both visceral adipocytes and alveolar epithelial type 2 cells in the lungs. Extra weight gained during the pandemic is expected to increase visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asians, further decreasing the ACE2 pool. In contrast, weight gain can increase local inflammation in fat depots in Western people, leading to worse COVID-related outcomes. Because of the biological mechanisms associated with fat accumulation, inflammation, and their differential expression in Southeast Asian and Western populations, the second wave of the pandemic may be more severe in Western countries, while Southeast Asians may benefit from their higher visceral fat depots.","output":"The Obesity Paradox Predicts the Second Wave of COVID-19 to Be Severe in Western Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Seraph-100? is a purification filter that blunts cytokine storm, providing a more favorable environment to establish immune homeostasis.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases.

Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM).

Eighteen complaints related to COVID-19 were logged. However, at this stage, we are unable to link any of these to a published change in clinical policy. Conclusions: Practice in the division was overall deemed to be safe in the designated period, with only 2 COVID-19 related incidents clearly related to a change in pathways and procedures.

In an attempt to identify new and potential SARS-CoV2 inhibitors targeting specific enzyme of the pathogen, a few induced fit models of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) including N-aryl amide and aryl sulfonamide based fragments were subjected to a multi-step in silico strategy. Sub-structure query of co-crystallographic fragments provided numerous ZINC15 driven commercially available compounds that entered molecular docking stage to find binding interactions/modes inside Mpro active site. Docking results were reevaluated through time dependent stability of top-ranked ligand-protease complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within 50 ns. Relative contribution of interacted residues in binding to the most probable binding pose was estimated through amino acid decomposition analysis in B3LYP level of theory with Def2-TZVPP split basis set. In confirmation of docking results, MD simulations revealed less perceptible torsional distortions (more stable binding mode) in binding of ZINC_252512772 (&#916;Gb -9.18 kcal/mol) into Mpro active site. H-bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts were determinant forces in binding interactions of in silico hit.

ARTIC data covered >90% of the virus genome fraction in the positive control and four of the five patient samples. Variant analysis in the ARTIC data detected 67 mutations, including 66 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and one deletion in ORF10. Of 66 SNVs, five were present in the spike gene, including nt22093 (M177I), nt23042 (S494P), nt23403 (D614G), nt23604 (P681H), and nt23709 (T716I). The D614G mutation is a common variant that has been shown to alter the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. Two spike protein mutations, P681H and T716I, which are represented in the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, were also detected in one patient. Long-amplicon data detected 58 variants, of which 70% were concordant with ARTIC data. Combined analysis of ARTIC +MRL data revealed 22 mutations that were either ambiguous (17) or not called at all (5) in ARTIC data due to poor sequencing coverage. For example, a common mutation in the ORF3a gene at nt25907 (G172V) was missed by the ARTIC assay. Hybrid data analysis improved sequencing coverage overall and identified 59 high confidence mutations for phylogenetic analysis. Thus, we show that while the short amplicon (ARTIC) assay provides good genomic coverage with high throughput, complementation of poorly captured intervals with long amplicon data can significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 genomic coverage and variant detection.","output":"A Short Plus Long-Amplicon Based Sequencing Approach Improves Genomic Coverage and Variant Detection In the SARS-CoV-2 Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of neurological complications and corresponding radiological findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature on COVID-19-associated neuroradiological findings and examine the prevalence of different findings in patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed. Any studies reporting CT or MRI neuroimaging findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Patient demographics, main radiological findings, neurological symptoms, and severity of COVID-19 infection were tabulated and quantified according to infection severity. RESULTS: Sixty-one studies published between 2019 and 2020 comprising 711 patients were analyzed according to severity of respiratory symptoms. The main neuroradiological findings for patients with mild classification were cranial nerve abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and white matter abnormalities, while the main findings in patients with severe classification were white matter abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSION: Neuroradiological manifestations in COVID-19 infection are highly heterogeneous and differ based on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Cranial nerve abnormalities appear exclusive to mild infection, with a high degree of olfactory tract involvement, while hemorrhagic events are more common in severe infection. Notably, ischemic infarction was equally prevalent in both mild and severe COVID-19 infection. Healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients should be aware of these potential complications and consider neurological assessment and neuroimaging studies when indicated.","output":"Neuroradiological Features of Mild and Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In July 2021, sixteen months into the Covid-19 pandemic, the institutional climate for PhD training in the School of Medicine was assessed for a second time. This survey of graduate students occurred 1 year after initial surveys of graduate students and training faculty in July 2020. The 2021 survey was completed by 99 PhD students in 11 PhD-granting programs. To allow comparisons between years, most of the 2021 questions were repeated with only minor edits. A few items were added to assess impacts of school-wide town hall meetings, a new PhD career club program, and enlarged mental health services. Several themes emerged. Students remain extremely concerned about the pandemics impact upon their training and long-term career prospects. They worry specifically about pandemic related reductions in research productivity and networking opportunities. Many students successfully adapted to laboratory research under pandemic restrictions but suffer from the continuing lack of social interaction even after in-person work hours increased. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression persist amongst 46% of the students, as compared to 51% in 2020. Nearly 80% of students continue to report strong satisfaction with mentoring relationships with their dissertation advisors, but to lesser extents with programs (66%), departments or centers (71%), the School of Medicine (32%) and the University (49%). Students (26%) express interest in the Ombuds office that was announced in late 2021. Some students wrote that the medical school could do a better job in embracing diversity and inclusion and in mentor training, and many stated that town hall meetings do not serve them well. Coping mechanisms shared by some students demonstrate impressive resilience. These results present a mixed picture. While aspects of biomedical PhD training have begun to recover as the pandemic continues, long-term consequences of the disruption raise challenges that must be addressed by efforts to restore and improve the learning environment required for 21st century research education.","output":"Second Climate Survey of Biomedical PhD Students in the Time of Covid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health authorities and organizations consider non-medical face masks as an additional passive means to prevent virus diffusion. Communication strategies disseminate information among the population that such masks are essential for mitigating virus diffusion. However, scientific studies are not conclusive in showing the undisputed filtration efficiency of fabric/cloth facial masks (both commercial and homemade). OBJECTIVES: This study examines scientific data about the effectiveness of face masks before and during the COVID-19 emergency. Present trends in the making of commercial and homemade fabric/cloth face masks are also examined. METHODS: Statistical data of published studies are analyzed and compared. Main considerations and suggestions are also extracted and discussed. Current approaches are examined for assessing the characteristics and effectiveness of fabric/cloth commercial and homemade face masks intended for the population. RESULT: Conflicting data exist as to whether non-medical masks have a protective effect from the spread of respiratory viruses. Both medical masks (MDs) and respiratory personal protection equipment (PPE) show a given effectiveness value. CONCLUSION: Concerning commercial and homemade fabric/cloth masks, giving general indications on the choice of materials and their assemblage is difficult as it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of the filter media with respect to the kind of multiphase fluid that may be emitted upon breathing, sneezing, or coughing under different environmental conditions. This is particularly important because airflow rate, temperature, humidity, and duration of use will affect the performance of filter media. Moreover, while a mask may have excellent filter media, droplets may leak into the face-piece unless there is an adequate facial seal. In the presence of leaks, any type of mask may actually offer less protection independently of its nominal filtering effciency.","output":"Effectiveness of face masks for the population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and state-mandated school closures in the spring of 2020, the management of type 1 diabetes in children underwent significant changes. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of stay-at-home orders on glycemic control in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 238 children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of South Alabama. Average Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels in the year prior to stay-at home orders (May 2019-April 2020) were compared with A1c values during the quarantine period (May 2020-July 2020) using a paired t-test. We also analyzed the change of A1c level with respect to sex, race, type of diabetes, type of insurance, and mode of insulin administration, using a 2-sample t-test. RESULTS: The average A1c significantly increased from 9.2% during the previous year to 9.5% during the quarantine period (p = 0.0097). The increase of A1c was significantly higher in public insurance patients (0.49% increase) compared to private insurance patients (0.03% increase), (p = 0.0137). We also observed a significant association between the direction of change and type of insurance. Forty-eight percent of public insurance patients had an A1c increase of > 0.5% while 54% of private insurance patients had no change or decrease in A1c (p = 0.0079).

However, the psychological mechanisms through which this occurs have yet to be systematically explored. Utilising the Social Identity Approach to Health, we explore whether identification with one's family group positively predicts health in people with self-reported EDs due to its potential to reduce feelings of loneliness. We investigate this in two online questionnaire studies (N = 82;N = 234), one conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and the second conducted in its early stages. In both studies, mediation analyses demonstrated that family identification was associated with fewer and less severe self-reported ED symptoms, and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced self-reported ED-related impact and anxiety. In both studies, these benefits were suggestive of a protective role of family identification against loneliness.

We aim to discuss the importance of recognition of viruses both epidemiologically and clinically as causes of lower respiratory tract infection. RECENT FINDINGS With advances of molecular testing it is now possible to identify viruses from clinical specimens which have many implications that range from therapeutics to antibiotic stewardship. Recent studies suggest that most of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, which corresponds to a paradigm shift for most clinicians. SUMMARY As community-acquired lower respiratory infections are the most common cause of ICU admission in the USA, it is important for medical providers to be aware of the association with viruses, especially in patients with immunosuppression because of solid organ transplant and hematologic malignancies when sometimes diagnosis can be challenging and patients can be exposed to unnecessary antibiotics.","output":"Community-acquired respiratory viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Since the inception of COVID-19, the international and national agencies across the globe have issued several guidelines and recommendations for the public as well as to the healthcare professionals. The fast spreading nature of this disease has brought various changes in the screening and treatment protocols in medicine and dentistry. Oral radiology is an integral part of oral screening and various dental treatment strategies. During oral radiology procedures, oral radiologists/radiology technicians come in direct contact with the patient as well as their body fluids such as saliva. It increases the risk of disease transmission from patients to oral radiologist and vice versa. Hence, proper infection control protocol should be implemented with new guidelines. This paper explains the practices to be followed in the oral radiology clinics at various stages whether in commercial set up or academic institute. Additionally, it explains the various precautions and new recommendations to be taken during various radiographic techniques. To add more, emphasis the importance of safe distancing, barrier protection and decontamination to be followed in dental clinics to prevent the spread of infection. Furthermore, the feasibility and procedure of online teaching methods for oral radiology clinics has been discussed. ABSTRACT: The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a global catastrophe that is plaguing mankind. In the past eight months since the world discovered about COVID-19, we learned a lot about server acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) and perhaps there is much more to discover and understand about the virus. With the current understanding of the disease, we assume it will remain in an active state of transmission and progression among the community for a long time. Thus, it is advisable to adopt the diseases prevention protocol in our daily and work routine. During this pandemic patient requiring dental treatment cannot be neglected and the role of dental imaging is crucial in delivering treatment. Hence, this article attempts to provide an evidence-based compilation about the mode of transmission and clinical features of COVID-19. It also throws light on the potential source of disease transmission in the dental radiology setting. In addition, it suggests preventive measures to curb the infection and infrastructural model of the clinical setting that will assist in achieving control over the disease transmission. This article intends to project a strategy about protocols, infrastructure, and daily activities in a dental radiology office that institutions can adopt with modifications according to their local scenario.","output":"Recommendations, Practices and Infrastructural Model for the Dental Radiology Set-up in Clinical and Academic Institutions in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the importance of bioart within the historical moment of the Anthropocene.

The National Health Service (NHS) is one such complex system within the UK that is facing a number of challenges. These range from an ageing and growing population with evolving healthcare needs, to increasing costs and reliance on private services. As such, a number of programmes and models have been introduced to transform care. Digital-first Primary Care (DfPC) is one such example. DfPC allows for faster and improved patient access to primary care by providing the choice of telephone and online consultations via the patient's GP practice or digital GP providers. The DfPC model has been at the forefront of primary care during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, hence the need for current research to evaluate its impact, suitability, and value in a post-pandemic world. Whilst this area is of high interest in the research community, there exists a gap in the method of analysis used. In this paper, the case for a soft systems methodology approach to DfPC is put forward.

The median lethal concentration (96 h) of CQ was 31.62 mg/ml. During acute treatment (CQ at 31.62 mg/ml) the treated fish groups showed a significant increase in GOT and GPT activities in blood plasma; whereas LDH activity was decreased when compare to control groups. To analyse the effects of drug at the lowest concentration, the fish were exposed to 3.16 mg/ml (1/10th of 96 h LC50 value) for 96 h. In sublethal treatment (3.16 mg/ml) GOT activity increased up to 14th day and decreased during the rest of the exposure period (21, 28 and 35th day). A biphasic response in GPT activity was observed. LDH activity was found to be increased throughout the study period (35 days) compare to control groups. The alterations in enzyme activities in blood plasma were found to be significant at p < 0.05 (DMRT). Many histopathological changes in vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney of fish were observed in CQ treated group (acute and sub-lethal) compare to normal group. The alterations in the enzymological and histopathological study in the present investigation indicate that the drug CQ has toxic effects on non-target organisms.

This industry, particularly in countries whose economies depend largely on tourism, has been forced into implementing many different kinds of measures to guarantee safety and hygiene.

From a point of view that is less focussed on the resolution of the \\"urgent\\", the situation we are experiencing may constitute an opportunity to reconsider the cognitive and institutional framework in which gastronomy has developed until now. This paper proposes a new paradigm called gastrology, which is a departure from the social imaginaries of gastronomy, with its common sense definitions, burdened with normativity. COVID-19 is a challenge to the scales in which we think about the world. The pandemic teaches us that, for example, the micro and the macro -the propagation of the virus in the form of aerosols and the global economic crisis, or the microbiome and climate change-are intimately related. In this new multiscale context, gastrology is an attempt to resignify gastronomy as a boundary-object: a convergence of all those scales that range from the planet to our intestine. This paradigm will require the confluence of multiple scientific disciplines that are disposed to abandon their certainties and rethink themselves as a consequence of contact with an object of study that is as complex as gastronomy.","output":"In praise of complexity: from gastronomy to gastrology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics leave their mark quickly.

We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 629,953 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and December 31, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 570,298 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 27.8% were non-White minorities. 54,645 individuals tested positive, with minorities representing 50.1%. Hispanics represented 34.3% of infections but only 13.4% of tests. While generally younger than White patients, Hispanics had higher rates of diabetes but fewer other comorbidities. 8,536 patients were hospitalized and 1,246 died, of whom 56.1% and 54.4% were non-White, respectively. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increased odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities. Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity, and Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.14C1.70]). CONCLUSION: Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, required excess hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and had higher odds of in-hospital mortality despite younger age.

Since the beginning of the emergency Healthcare Workers' (HCWs) involvement was prominent, mainly due to direct assistance to COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we implemented a prevention policy for HCW screening through serological and RT-PCR testing. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: HCW screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for prevention and control of the pandemic. Lombardy's Healthcare authorities settled a screening process for HCWs divided into three steps: 1) body temperature assessment at the beginning and the end of work shift, if fever > 37.5 C was present the HCW was sent back home and a nasopharyngeal swab was performed; 2) progressive recruitment for serological testing; 3) on those positive to IgG a nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested for viral RNA by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among 79185 HCW tested, 9589 (12%) were positive on serological IgG testing. Of the 9589 positive a nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 6884. Of these 358 (5%) tested positive and the remaining 6526 (95%) negative to RT-PCR. We calculated a Positive Predictive Value of 5.2%. The rate of positive serological tests for each Healthcare facility varied between 0% and 78%. Five percent of all facilities, belonging to Brescia, Bergamo and Cremona area, reported a positivity rate higher than 40% in HCWs. A second cluster (18% of all facilities), involving the same geographical area, reported a rate between 20% and 40%, whereas the remaining facilities (76%) of the region a rate <20%. LESSONS: Serological IgG testing can be, if followed by immediate nasopharyngeal swab testing, a valid screening intervention on asymptomatic HCWs especially in a high infection prevalence setting. KEY MESSAGES: Serological IgG testing can be, if followed by immediate nasopharyngeal swab testing, a valid screening intervention on asymptomatic HCWs.

OBJECTIVE: Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING: 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION: Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections.

MethodsA case-control design was employed to recruit 32 women (n = 17 SARS-CoV-2; n = 15 controls) matched on age (54 {+/-} 12 years), body mass index (27 {+/-} 6 kg/m2), smoking status, and history of cardiopulmonary disease. Participants completed a series of assessments including the Modified Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire (PFSDQ-M), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time PA. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 participants exhibited poorer functional status (p = 0.008) and reduced leisure-time PA (p = 0.004) compared to controls. Significant between-group differences were also detected for the POMS total mood disturbance with sub-scale analyses revealing elevated tension, confusion, and lower vigor among SARS-CoV-2 participants (all p-values < 0.05).

Although the neural pathways activated by PNS have been well studied, those by MPS are still unclear. Here we investigated whether MPS activates Ia-sensory nerves and induces antidromic firing of motor nerves. Ten able-bodied males and females participated in this study. We confirmed that soleus MPS did not induce the H-reflex while soleus PNS did. Furthermore, MPS of the tibialis anterior muscle did not induce the reciprocal inhibition of soleus muscle while PNS did. For testing the effect of MPS on motor neuron excitability, we examined the H-reflex modulation by soleus MPS. When the conditioning and test interval on was under 100-ms and the conditioning stimulus intensity was above 30-mA, soleus MPS induced the H-reflex inhibition. This suggests that soleus MPS produces antidromic firing that can induce after-hyperpolarization. These results suggest that MPS predominantly activates the motor nerve without depolarizing the Ia-sensory nerve. Since MPS is applicable to larger number of muscles compared to PNS, utilizing MPS can lead to more versatile neuromodulation of the spinal cord.","output":"Motor point stimulation primarily activates motor nerve."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Rapid dissemination of findings regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its potential effects on pregnancy is crucial to support understanding and development of recommendations for optimization of obstetrics care However, much of the current studies published are in the form of case reports or case series which can be prone to biases Other factors also further complicate attempts to analyze data accurately Hence, this evaluation hopes to highlight some of these problems and provide suggestions to help clinicians mitigate and make reasonable conclusions when reading the abundant yet limited body of evidence when furthering their research efforts METHODS: Studies regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy were searched on databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library Manual search of references of select articles were also undertaken Apart from summarizing study limitations identified by authors, the characteristics of current literature and systematic reviews were also evaluated to identify potential factors affecting accuracy of subsequent analysis RESULTS: Factors such as innate biasness in study design of current literature, duplicate reporting, differing inclusion criteria of systematic reviews, scarce data, inadequate follow-up period and limitations of systematic reviews have been shown to hinder the ability for accurate data extrapolation DISCUSSION: Unless additional studies are conducted in identified areas of data scarcity and a common list of factors affecting accuracy of data analysis are taken into account when developing recommendations, discrepancies will continue to arise and accurate data analysis and valid systematic reviews will be precluded","output":"Problems with Early Systematic Reviews: The Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Reports of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination have emerged. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by vaccine product, vaccination dose number, sex, and age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Four cohort studies were conducted according to a common protocol, and the results were combined using meta-analysis. Participants were 23 122 522 residents aged 12 years or older. They were followed up from December 27, 2020, until incident myocarditis or pericarditis, censoring, or study end (October 5, 2021). Data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, hospital diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis, and covariates for the participants were obtained from linked nationwide health registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. EXPOSURES: The 28-day risk periods after administration date of the first and second doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, including BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and AZD1222 or combinations thereof. A homologous schedule was defined as receiving the same vaccine type for doses 1 and 2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident outcome events were defined as the date of first inpatient hospital admission based on primary or secondary discharge diagnosis for myocarditis or pericarditis from December 27, 2020, onward. Secondary outcome was myocarditis or pericarditis combined from either inpatient or outpatient hospital care. Poisson regression yielded adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and excess rates with 95% CIs, comparing rates of myocarditis or pericarditis in the 28-day period following vaccination with rates among unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Among 23 122 522 Nordic residents (81% vaccinated by study end; 50.2% female), 1077 incident myocarditis events and 1149 incident pericarditis events were identified. Within the 28-day period, for males and females 12 years or older combined who received a homologous schedule, the second dose was associated with higher risk of myocarditis, with adjusted IRRs of 1.75 (95% CI, 1.43-2.14) for BNT162b2 and 6.57 (95% CI, 4.64-9.28) for mRNA-1273. Among males 16 to 24 years of age, adjusted IRRs were 5.31 (95% CI, 3.68-7.68) for a second dose of BNT162b2 and 13.83 (95% CI, 8.08-23.68) for a second dose of mRNA-1273, and numbers of excess events were 5.55 (95% CI, 3.70-7.39) events per 100 000 vaccinees after the second dose of BNT162b2 and 18.39 (9.05-27.72) events per 100 000 vaccinees after the second dose of mRNA-1273. Estimates for pericarditis were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this large cohort study indicated that both first and second doses of mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. For individuals receiving 2 doses of the same vaccine, risk of myocarditis was highest among young males (aged 16-24 years) after the second dose. These findings are compatible with between 4 and 7 excess events in 28 days per 100 000 vaccinees after BNT162b2, and between 9 and 28 excess events per 100 000 vaccinees after mRNA-1273.

Therefore, international management guidelines recommend regular screening in women with NF1 starting from 30 to 35 years. As the psychological impacts of breast cancer screening in other high-risk populations cannot be extended to women with NF1, due to increased incidence of cognitive and mental health issues, the psychological harms of breast screening in women with NF1 are unknown. Consequently, the aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of breast cancer screening in women with NF1 attending an established risk management clinic. Twenty-eight women with NF1 (30C50 years) completed psychological well-being and patient experience questionnaires, administered across five time points, before and after their initial and second round annual breast screening visits. Preliminary findings demonstrated the screening regimen was well-tolerated, with most participants reporting high satisfaction with the screening process. Overall, no significant increase in psychological distress related to the breast screening process was identified, with mean cancer worry and anxiety scores decreasing over time. However, some women did experience negative aspects of screening and barriers to re-attendance at annual breast screening appointments. As some women with NF1 exhibited clinical levels of psychological distress prior to screening, efforts to identify those at risk and additional support to address concerns and expectations throughout the breast screening process may be beneficial.

Thirty-four percent of the enrolled patients were deceased during the in-hospital stay. The percentage of severely frail patients, assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale, was significantly increased in deceased patients compared to the survived ones. The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was not significantly associated with increased risk of death. Among the routine parameters, neutrophilia, eosinopenia, lymphopenia, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, and NT-proBNP showed the highest predictive values. The fully adjusted Cox regressions models confirmed that high neutrophil %, NLR, derived NLR (dNLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and low lymphocyte count, eosinophil %, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were the best predictors of in-hospital mortality, independently from age, gender, and other potential confounders.

The programme was inclusive, with a focus on the Foundation Year 1 (FY1) cohort. Junior doctors are often the least experienced of the medical team;the second wave presented a unique challenge for FY1s- who had only ever practised within a pandemic.

Interventions included: evening Junior Doctor COVID-19 updates;prioritisation of the annual Junior Doctor Awards (JDAs);once-weekly bitesize, non-urgent updates instead of anxiety-provoking multiple daily emails;FY1s support cafs, online mess events and enhanced support through evening sessions with clinical psychologists. COVID-19 evening updates were popular, with a peak of 84 attendees. Feedback was encouraging, indicating a demand for these to continue post-pandemic. The clinical psychologists were well-received with informal feedback praising the sessions. FY1s support cafs, unfortunately, were hampered by poor turnout during the day.

Based on a sample of 2229 rural residents nationwide, the Structural Equation Model was adopted to analyze the influence of social capital and technological empowerment on pandemic resilience in rural areas. The proportion of diversity, adequacy, and effectiveness of pandemic prevention measures taken by communities was about 57%. Social capital (0.667) and technological empowerment (0.325) had a significant positive impact on rural resilience and pandemic prevention. Social capital plays a mediating role between technological empowerment and pandemic resilience in rural areas. The risk of disease in society stimulates the inherent social capital factors in villages, with the individual social network generating strong social support. Technological empowerment can not only provide new methods for the connection of social capital, but also bring new means for rural authorities to improve their governance capabilities. Social trust in social capital plays an important role in rural resilience and pandemic prevention. The indirect effect of technological empowerment through social capital on pandemic resilience is greater than its direct effect.

METHODS: Using a qualitative design, 14 circus arts students from the National Institute of Circus Arts (Australia) were individually interviewed via teleconsultation. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five overarching themes were identified: (i) impact (physical and mental), (ii) opportunity, (iii) developing routine, (iv) client-therapist relationship, and (v) transformation. All participants reported positive physical changes to their shoulder including increases in strength, stability, range of motion, less pain, \\"clicking\\" and \\"clunking,\\" improved posture, muscle memory, as well as carry-over to functional circus activities. The pandemic's mental impact varied across the cohort, with positive and negative experiences described in relation to cognitive, social, and affective factors. Most performers felt the pandemic provided an opportunity to focus on rehabilitation of their shoulder. The program effects were also underpinned by positive client-therapist relationships and a progressive transformation of learning where students gained knowledge of their condition, developed tools to manage their current shoulder impairment, and learned how to apply this new knowledge to future management of their condition. CONCLUSION: A shoulder exercise intervention delivered via teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in subjective reports of positive physical changes to the participants' shoulder health complaint.

OH has been used to develop strategies for zoonotic Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). However, the ethical case for OH as an alternative to more traditional public health approaches is largely absent from the discourse. To study the ethics of OH, we examined perceptions of the human health and ecological priorities for the management of zoonotic EID in the Southeast Asia country of Singapore. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods study using a modified Delphi technique with a panel of 32 opinion leaders and 11 semi-structured interviews with a sub-set of those experts in Singapore. Panellists rated concepts of OH and priorities for zoonotic EID preparedness planning using a series of scenarios developed through the study. Interview data were examined qualitatively using thematic analysis. FINDINGS We found that panellists agreed that OH is a cross-disciplinary collaboration among the veterinary, medical, and ecological sciences, as well as relevant government agencies encompassing animal, human, and environmental health. Although human health was often framed as the most important priority in zoonotic EID planning, our qualitative analysis suggested that consideration of non-human animal health and welfare was also important for an effective and ethical response. The panellists also suggested that effective pandemic planning demands regional leadership and investment from wealthier countries to better enable international cooperation. CONCLUSION We argue that EID planning under an OH approach would benefit greatly from an ethical ecological framework that accounts for justice in human, animal, and environmental health.","output":"Justice Is the Missing Link in One Health: Results of a Mixed Methods Study in an Urban City State."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the world causing serious morbidity and mortality. healthcare professionals (HCP) are on the front line in the face of this pandemic and are identified as priorities for COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability rate of the COVID-19 vaccination among HCP and to identify their predisposing factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire including a randomized sample of (HCP) at the university hospitals of Southern Tunisia on April 2021. RESULTS: Overall, 223 cases were females (74.4%). The average age was 29.5 years 8.26. In total, 178 HCP were doctors (59.3%), 147 HCP (49%) were working in medical services and 58 HCP (19.3%) were in intensive care units. The vaccination acceptance rate was 65.3% (196), while 73 cases (24.3%) were reluctant. Factors statistically associated with vaccine acceptability were female gender (Odds ratio (OR)=2.9;p=0.001), advanced age (30.238.27 vs 28.098.12;p=0.034), urbanity of residence (OR = 4.5;p<0.01) and direct contact with positive COVID-19 patients (OR = 1.9;p=0.007).

The present study aimed to carry out a health impact assessment in Recife, Brazil, hypothesizing a scenario in which the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 remained, throughout the year, as in the most restrictive period of human mobility. Particular material data (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured during the pandemic and population and health (mortality, hospital admissions for heart and respiratory problems) data from 2018 were used. We observed a reduction in the concentration of PM2.5 in up to 43.7% and PM10 up to 29.5% during the period of social isolation in the city of Recife. The reduction in PM2.5 would avoid 106 annual deaths from non-external causes and 58 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases. In this scenario, $ 294.88 million would be saved ($ 114.88 million from heart problems and $ 180 million from non-external causes). When considering hospitalizations avoided by the decrease in PM10, we observed 57 fewer hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, 42 for heart diseases and a reduction of 37 deaths due to non-external causes. The reduction in spending on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations would exceed $ 330,000.

This study explored the factors mediating this association and whether older age was associated with increased mortality risk in the absence of other risk factors. METHODS: In UK Biobank, a population cohort study, baseline data were linked to COVID-19 deaths. Poisson regression was used to study the association between current age and COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: Among eligible participants, 438 (0.09%) died of COVID-19. Current age was associated exponentially with COVID-19 mortality. Overall, participants aged 75 years were at 13-fold (95% CI 9.13C17.85) mortality risk compared with those <65 years. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, high systolic blood pressure, low handgrip strength, and multiple long-term conditions were significant mediators, and collectively explained 39.3% of their excess risk. The associations between these risk factors and COVID-19 mortality were stronger among older participants. Participants aged 75 without additional risk factors were at 4-fold risk (95% CI 1.57C9.96, P = 0.004) compared with all participants aged <65 years.

Declines in the neuromuscular function and altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained, sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function.

The medical records of all SCD patients aged up to 18 years admitted for all SCD related acute complications over a period of 13 month have been reviewed. Two patient groups have been formed based on the presence of an ACS within the study period. Epidemiologic data, medical history, the clinical presentation at admission but also blood counts in steady state, at admission and along the hospital stay were compared for a total of 96 hospital stays. There is no difference for age or hemoglobin phenotype between the two major patient groups. Male sex and having had a previous ACS episode in the past were significantly more important in the group of patients hospitalized for ACS. Thoracic pain in an SCD patient who doesn't show typical ACS symptoms should be interpreted as a risk factor for ACS. In conclusion, male sex, medical history of at least one ACS and thoracic pain at hospital admission are associated with high risk of developing ACS.","output":"[Respiratory complications of sickle cell anemia in children: the acute chest syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been declared by the World Health Organization after it has gripped many countries of the world.

With effective vaccines available since the end of 2020 and most HW in Germany vaccinated by now, this burden is mitigated but does still exist. In particular, high hygiene standards need to remain implemented to protect HW and patients. The increased use of hand washing, disinfections, and personal protective equipment (PPE) might increase the risk for skin diseases in HW. For this presentation, we analysed claims for occupational diseases (OD) concerning COVID-19 and skin diseases and we report results of a survey on skin irritation because of PPE during the pandemic in HW in Germany. Materials and Methods: The BGW is a compensation board for work related diseases in HW. Claims of ODs of the BGW concerning SARS-CoV-2 infections were analysed since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. An online survey concerning skins irritation was carried out with the support of a professional nursing association. The survey was completed by 1.500 nurses or 10 % of those invited. Results: About 80.000 COVID-19 cases are confirmed as OD. About 100 HW died because of COVID-19 and about 1.500 were hospitalized or need long-term rehabilitation. The number of ODs because of skin diseases did not increase during the pandemic. However, 280 claims because of skin irritations of the face or head were filled. Irritation of the skin because of wearing masks was reported by 60 % of the survey participants. Conclusions: The burden of COVID-19 in HW is high.

F(ab)(2) fragments purified from the plasma of hyperimmunized horses showed high antigen-specific affinity. Experiments in rabbits suggested that the F(ab)(2) displays a linear pharmacokinetics with approximate plasma half-life of 47 h. In vitro microneutralization assays using the purified F(ab)(2) displayed high neutralization titers against five different variants of SARS-CoV-2 including the Delta variant, demonstrating its potential efficacy against the emerging viral variants. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that F(ab)(2) generated against SARS-CoV-2 in equines have high neutralization titers and have broad target-range against the evolving variants, making passive immunotherapy a potential regimen against the existing and evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in combating COVID-19.","output":"Equine immunoglobulin fragment F(ab)(2) displays high neutralizing capability against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The risk of depression has risen in the general population during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study was conducted to explore risk and protective factors associated with depression among the general population uninfected by COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,500 representative South Korean citizens aged 19C65 years through an anonymous online survey. Depression was defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-10 score of 10 or higher. Other questionnaires included one measuring psycho-behavioural and social changes, and stress, due to COVID-19, a six-item version of the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), and a three-item version of the UCLA loneliness scale. Results: Of the 1492 participants not infected by COVID-19, 312 (20.9%) exhibited depression. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that depression was positively associated with COVID-19-related stress and psycho-behavioural variables such as disturbances in eating and sleeping, younger age, smoking, underlying mental illness, and loneliness scale scores. In contrast, exercise three or more times per week and GQ-6 scale scores were inversely associated with depression. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining daily routines including eating, sleeping, and regular exercise and focusing on gratitude may be important for the prevention of depression. In addition, more attention should be paid to vulnerable populations, including young people, those with mental illnesses, and smokers, who might be more susceptible to depression.","output":"Risk and Protective Factors of Depression in the General Population during the COVID-19 Epidemic in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites transmitted to humans and other animals by contaminated water, food, or direct contact. They mainly cause gastrointestinal symptoms, although subclinical infections are also common. Cats are primarily infected by host-adapted Cryptosporidium felis while C. parvum and C. muris have also been detected in some cases. In this study, the molecular prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was investigated by screening 399 fecal samples collected from stray cats using nested PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene for the first time in Turkey. Additionally, Cryptosporidium PCR-positive samples were genotyped by nested PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and subsequently, amplicons of 18S SSU rRNA were sequenced. They were further subtyped by amplification and sequencing of the gp60 gene. RESULTS: Among fecal samples screened, 12 of them (3%) were found to be Cryptosporidium-positive, and according to RFLP and sequencing of 18S rRNA gene, all positive samples were identified as C. felis. Subtyping analyses at the gp60 gene showed that C. felis isolates belonged to the XIXa subtype family, which are closely related to human subtypes of the parasite. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are important in terms of indicating the potential role of stray cats for transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. to humans or other animals. Also, the presence of XIXa, which is the dominant subtype family of C. felis in cats and humans was shown for the first time in stray cats of ?zmir, Turkey.","output":"Molecular prevalence and subtyping of Cryptosporidium spp. in fecal samples collected from stray cats in ?zmir, Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Integrating online and offline data is critical for uncovering the interdependence between policy and public emotional and behavioral responses in order to aid the development of effective spatially targeted interventions during crises.

Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak.

One single transplantation of 2.5 107 HUMSCs or initiation of daily oral nintedanib/pirfenidone administration was performed on day 21 following BLM damage. RESULTS: Pulmonary function examination revealed that BLM rats exhibited a significant decrease in blood oxygen saturation and an increase in respiratory rates. While no significant improvements were found in BLM rats receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, those who transplanted with HUMSCs showed a statistical amelioration in blood oxygen saturation and significant alleviation in respiratory rates. Quantification results revealed that a significant reduction in alveolar space and marked increases in substantial cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the left lungs of BLM rats. No significant alteration was observed in BLM rats administered nintedanib or pirfenidone. However, BLM rats transplanted with HUMSCs had a significant recovery in alveolar space and noticeable decreases in cell infiltration and collagen deposition. The inflammatory cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage was increased in the BLM group. While the rats treated with nintedanib or pirfenidone had a lower cell number than the BLM group, a higher cell number was found as compared with the Normal group. In rats transplanted with HUMSCs, the cell number did not differ from the Normal group.

Furthermore, the interplay between age, gender, and fall history with falls has not been adequately addressed in adults aged 70 years or older. The aims of this secondary analysis were to: (1) prospectively explore the association of FSE and fall events considering age, gender, and fall history, and (2) examine the characteristics of fall events and fall-related outcomes. Forty-seven community-dwelling adults over 70 years of age were followed for about 12 months. During the follow-up, 22 participants with low FSE experienced 119 fall events whereas 25 participants with high FSE reported 106 fall events. Among fallers, 72.3% (n = 34) experienced recurrent fall events. About 15.0% (n = 34) of 225 fall events resulted in injuries and 4.0% of injuries required medical care. FSE was a statistically significant predictor of future fall events (incident rate ratio = 0.96, p = .013) regardless of age, gender, and fall history. Participants with low FSE were more likely than those with high FSE to fall more frequently without noticeable prodromal symptoms and apparent reasons. These findings suggest that FSE is an important protective factor against future fall events.

However, this practice remains controversial because the safety and efficacy of the technique has not been carefully documented. METHODS The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of a sealed gauze dressing with wall suction applied (GSUC) compared to vacuum assisted-closure (VAC), both soaked with topical antimicrobials. Subjects included 31 hospitalized patients with acutely infected wounds compared with 56 patients with noninfected wounds. RESULTS There were significant reductions in wound surface area and volume in both infected and noninfected groups; there was no significant difference in the rate of change observed in the GSUC vs the VAC arms of the study. In the infected group, the reduction in wound surface area was 4.4% per day for GSUC and 4.8% per day for VAC. Wound volume was 7.8% per day for GSUC, and 9.7% per day for VAC (P < 0.001 for all). Evidence of wound infection in all patients, regardless of treatment group, resolved by 96 hours of onset of treatment, and there were no complications specifically related to the use of a sealed dressing over infected wounds. CONCLUSION Gauze dressing with wall suction and VAC therapy can be used in selected acute, infected wounds and both methods of treatment appear to be similarly effective for reducing wound surface area and volume. .","output":"A prospective randomized trial comparing subatmospheric wound therapy with a sealed gauze dressing and the standard vacuum-assisted closure device: a supplementary subgroup analysis of infected wounds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyses the emotional exhaustion of students inhigher education, derived from the extremely technology-relatedstrain associated to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a conservation of resources approach.

It is thus shown that the shared goals advocated by the WEF would converge to a transition from a modern pluralist to a new-normative order stratified to the primacy of individual, institutional, and planetary health. In discussing sociological implications of this transition, a vision emerges of a new digitally enhanced medieval period where health plays the role once played by religion. In this restorist scenario of a neo-medieval world health society, the emergence of new social strata corresponding to different levels of purity, infection, or pollution would be a probable consequence.

The one-year scheme provides Psych Stars with a matched mentor, free registration at the RCPsych's International Congress, financial support for psychiatry-related activities, journal subscriptions and access to two online learning platforms. This project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme in supporting Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry and in promoting psychiatry as a career choice, through use of a survey for both Psych Stars and mentors. METHOD: Surveys were sent to all Psych Stars and mentors from the first cohort of the scheme. The mentor and student surveys contained a mixture of ranking, multiple choice, closed-ended and open-ended questions. Questions examined: clarity of the scheme's aims and objectives; benefits of each aspect of the scheme; impact of the scheme on application to Core Training; benefits and barriers to successful mentorship; adequacy of mentor support from the RCPsych and suggestions to improve the scheme. RESULT: Six Psych Stars and nine mentors completed the respective surveys. All Psych Stars stated the scheme was enjoyable. Five Psych Stars were more likely to apply for Core Training because of the scheme. All Psych Stars identified the most beneficial aspect of the scheme being the funded place at the RCPsych International Congress. Other aspects highly ranked included: funding to explore areas of psychiatry of interest and the opportunity to be an ambassador for psychiatry. All Psych Stars found the mentorship useful. Mentors supported Psych Stars by providing career advice, suggesting relevant conferences to attend and assisting Psych Stars make decisions on how to use their allocated funding. Barriers to mentorship that were identified included: geographical separation, limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of time. For mentors, areas for improvement included clearer aims and objectives and more support from the RCPsych. Both mentors and Psych Stars suggested forming a network of Psych Stars and mentors would be useful to share ideas and experiences. CONCLUSION: This evaluation shows that the Psych Star scheme successfully supports Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry, and promotes psychiatry as a career choice. This survey has been helpful in identifying what aspects of the scheme are particularly attractive, and also, importantly, how the Psych Stars scheme can be improved for future cohorts.

Most Ad-based therapies utilize species C serotypes, with Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) most commonly employed. Prior clinical trials demonstrated low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors, mainly due to the absence of Ad5 primary receptor (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor, CAR) on cancer cells. Engineering serotype chimeric vectors (Ad5/3) to utilize Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors has greatly improved their oncolytic potential. Clinical translation of these infectivity-enhanced vectors has been challenging due to a lack of replication permissive animal models. In this study, we explored pigs as a model to study the performance of fiber-modified Ad5/3 chimeric vectors. As a control, the Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus was used. We analyzed binding, gene transfer, replication, and cytolytic ability of Ad5 and Ad5/3 in various non-human cell lines (murine, hamster, canine, porcine). Among all tested cell lines only porcine cells supported active binding and replication of Ad5/3. Syrian hamster cells supported Ad5 replication but showed no evidence of productive viral replication after infection with Ad5/3 vectors. Transduction and replication ability of Ad5/3 in porcine cells outperformed Ad5, a phenomenon often observed in human cancer cell lines. Replication of Ad5 and Ad5/3 was subsequently evaluated in vivo in immunocompetent pigs. Quantitative PCR analyses 7 days post infection revealed Ad5 and Ad5/3 DNA and replication-dependent luciferase activity in the swine lungs and spleen indicating active replication in these tissues. These studies demonstrated the flaws in using Syrian hamsters for testing serotype chimeric Ad5/3 vectors.

During COVID-19, delivering medical service was negatively affected. AIMS: To describe the impact of COVID-19 on psoriasis healthcare delivery, management, and practice. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 197 dermatologists using a validated online questionnaire. The survey evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on the decisions, prescription patterns, appointments rescheduling, and healthcare delivery for psoriasis patients by dermatologists. The questionnaire was developed and validated with a reliability score >0.7. RESULTS: During the pandemic, most dermatologists delayed initiating biological/immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis unless urgently needed by the patient. For patients already receiving biologics or immunosuppressive treatment, most dermatologists favored continuation of therapy. Almost half (44.2%) of participants do not perform SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening before initiating biologics/immunosuppressive therapy. Dermatologists also reported an increased prescription of topical medications (79.2%), natural sunlight (28.4%), acitretin (26.9%), and home UVB (21.3%). Opinions regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment/prophylaxis for psoriasis patients were controversial. Intervals between face-to-face follow-up visits were prolonged by 71.6% of dermatologists.

METHODS: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019. The number of patients with fragility fractures requiring admission remained constant (32 patients in 2019 vs 31 patients during lockdown; p > 0.05).

A programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift is required by coronaviruses for the production of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase which in turn is essential for viral replication. The frameshifting signal encoded in the viral genome has additional features that are not essential for frameshifting. Elucidation of the differences between coronavirus frameshift signals and signals from other viruses may help our understanding of these features. Here we summarize current knowledge and add additional insight regarding the function of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal in the coronavirus lifecycle.","output":"The role of programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting in coronavirus propagation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the value of the right hemi-diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and its variation in predicting extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD. METHODS: All included patients with COPD received mechanical ventilation (MV) and were ready to wean from MV. After patients passed the 30 min spontaneous breathing trail (SBT), extubation was considered to be feasible, and the right DE measured by ultrasound at 0 min, 5 min, and 30 min of SBT were named as DE(0), DE(5), and DE(30), respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients succeeded extubation; 12 patients failed. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) of DE(30) and DE(30?5) (the variation between 30 and 5 min) were 0.762 and 0.835; a cutoff value of DE(30) > 1.72 cm and DE(30?5) > 0.16 cm were associated with a successful extubation with a sensitivity of 76% and 84%, a specificity of 75% and 83.3%, respectively. The predictive probability equation of the DE(30) plus ?DE(30?5) was P = 1/[1 + e(?(?5.625+17.689?DE)(30?5)(+1.802DE)(30)())], a cutoff value of P > 0.626 was associated with a successful extubation with the AUC(ROC) of 0.867, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 83.3%.

However, interactions between their biogeochemical fates remain poorly characterized, with absence of efficient route to decontamination of this combined pollution. In this work, microbial-driven Pyr degradation coupled to V(V) reduction was demonstrated for the first time. Removal efficiencies of Pyr and V(V) reached 94.8  1.55% and 51.2  0.20% in 72 h operation. The supplementation of co-substrate (glucose) deteriorated Pyr degradation slightly, but significantly promoted V(V) reduction efficiency to 84.5  0.635%. Pyr was mineralized with NH4+-N accumulation, while insoluble vanadium (IV) was the major product from V(V) bio-reduction. It was observed that Bacillus and Pseudomonas realized synchronous Pyr and V(V) removals independently. Interspecific synergy between Pyr degraders and V(V) reducers also functioned with addition of co-substrate. V(V) was bio-reduced through alternative electron acceptor pathway conducted by gene nirS encoded nitrite reductase, which was evidenced by gene abundance and enzyme activity. Cytochrome c, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and extracellular polymeric substances also contributed to the coupled bioprocess.

Methodologically, the study applies the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (EGARCH) model. The study utilizes the data set for the period, 2011 to 2019, a period before the COVID-19 pandemic. The research outcome revealed three interesting observations. First, Bitcoin and the South African stock market are independent of each other. Second, the study discovered a bidirectional shock transmission between Bitcoin and USD/ZAR in the mean returns only, but not variance. Lastly, results confirm the existence of a bidirectional volatility spillover in both the mean and variance between the JSE stock, USD/ZAR markets. The popularity of cryptocurrency in South Africa grows tandem with global market trends. However, its intermarket relationship with the exchange rate and stock markets is yet to be adequately studied, and the current paper contributes towards closing this gap. Unlike most related papers, the current study follows an intuitive alternative of using cross-exchange rates in the analysis with revealing insights. The result of this study should enrich knowledge with respect to cryptocurrency implications towards monetary policy and regulatory decisions of financial markets stability.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a structured approach for eliciting and evaluating a broad range of assessment criteria, including key stakeholders values, aiming to support decision makers in priority setting. METHODS: For a set of cost\\\\effective substitute interventions for depression care, the appraisal criteria were adopted from the Australian Assessing Cost\\\\Effectiveness initiative. All substitute interventions were assessed in an appraisal, using focus group discussions and semi\\\\structured interviews conducted among key stakeholders. RESULTS: Appraisal of the substitute cost\\\\effective interventions yielded an overview of considerations and an overall recommendation for decision makers. Two out of the thirteen pairs were deemed acceptable and realistic, that is investment in therapist\\\\guided and Internet\\\\based cognitive behavioural therapy instead of cognitive behavioural therapy in mild depression, and investment in combination therapy rather than individual psychotherapy in severe depression. In the remaining substitution pairs, substantive issues affected acceptability. The key issues identified were as follows: workforce capacity, lack of stakeholder support and the need for change in clinicians attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic identification of stakeholders considerations allows decision makers to prioritize among cost\\\\effective policy options. Moreover, this approach entails an explicit and transparent priority\\\\setting procedure and provides insights into the intended and unintended consequences of using a certain health technology.

Subsequently, a virus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of the disease. Currently, the epidemic has spread all over the world. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. At the moment, the nuclide acid test is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of this infection. Methods: In the present paper, we report our experience with all patients who came to the Emergency Department from March 1 to April 1, 2020, with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patients: they all underwent a first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency department and, if negative, a second one after at least 24 hours. Results: Our study shows how the results obtained at time zero are usually identical to the ones obtained after 24 hours. We thus suggest, in patients with high suspicion of COVID19 and a negative result at the first swab, to repeat the test after at least 48 hours, during which patients with symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia disease should be kept in isolation to avoid the risk of contagion. Conclusions: these measures and in particular the early identifica-tion of cases with consequent isolation will allow the containment of the spread of the virus, representing one of the fundamental measures to guarantee and strengthen the control of the infection to reduce hospital admissions, the overload of national health service and health costs.","output":"Patient safety recommendations and management in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Recent reports from communities severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found lower rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Whether the pandemic has affected OHCA outcomes more broadly is unknown OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and OHCA outcomes, including in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 disease burden DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a large US registry of OHCAs to compare outcomes during the pandemic period of March 16 through April 30, 2020, with those from March 16 through April 30, 2019 Cases were geocoded to US counties, and the COVID-19 mortality rate in each county was categorized as very low (0-25 per million residents), low (26-100 per million residents), moderate (101-250 per million residents), high (251-500 per million residents), or very high (&gt;500 per million residents) As additional controls, the study compared OHCA outcomes during the prepandemic period (January through February) and peripandemic period (March 1 through 15) EXPOSURE: The COVID-19 pandemic MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sustained ROSC (20 minutes), survival to discharge, and OHCA incidence RESULTS: A total of 19 303 OHCAs occurred from March 16 through April 30 in both years, with 9863 cases in 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62 6 [19 3] years;6040 men [61 3%]) and 9440 in 2019 (mean [SD] age, 62 2 [19 2] years;5922 men [62 7%]) During the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC were lower than in 2019 (23 0% vs 29 8%;adjusted rate ratio, 0 82 [95% CI, 0 78-0 87];P &lt; 001) Sustained ROSC rates were lower by between 21% (286 of 1429 [20 0%] in 2020 vs 305 of 1130 [27 0%] in 2019;adjusted RR, 0 79 [95% CI, 0 65-0 97]) and 33% (149 of 863 [17 3%] in 2020 vs 192 of 667 [28 8%] in 2019;adjusted RR, 0 67 [95% CI, 0 56-0 80]) in communities with high or very high COVID-19 mortality, respectively;however, rates of sustained ROSC were also lower by 11% (583 of 2317 [25 2%] in 2020 vs 740 of 2549 [29 0%] in 2019;adjusted RR, 0 89 [95% CI, 0 81-0 98]) to 15% (889 of 3495 [25 4%] in 2020 vs 1109 of 3532 [31 4%] in 2019;adjusted RR, 0 85 [95% CI, 0 78-0 93]) in communities with very low and low COVID-19 mortality Among emergency medical services agencies with complete data on hospital survival (7085 total patients), survival to discharge was lower during the pandemic compared with 2019 (6 6% vs 9 8%;adjusted RR, 0 83 [95% CI, 0 69-1 00];P = 048), primarily in communities with moderate to very high COVID-19 mortality (interaction P = 049) Incidence of OHCA was higher than in 2019, but the increase was largely observed in communities with high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 38 6 [95% CI, 37 1-40 1] per million residents) and very high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 28 7 [95% CI, 26 7-30 6] per million residents) In contrast, there was no difference in rates of sustained ROSC or survival to discharge during the prepandemic and peripandemic periods in 2020 vs 2019 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early during the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC for OHCA were lower throughout the US, even in communities with low COVID-19 mortality rates Overall survival was lower, primarily in communities with moderate or high COVID-19 mortality","output":"Outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A higher risk of death from coronavirus disease 19 has been shown for patients with solid cancers or haematological malignancies (HM).

RESULTS: Patients presenting with suicidal ideation and concurrent alcohol levels  80 mg/dL were no longer reporting suicidal ideation at blood alcohol level < 80 mg/dL in 69% of cases, compared to 38% for patients without alcohol levels on presentation (Chi-square, p=0.000012). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that patients presenting to the ED with complaints related to suicidal behavior who are found to have concurrent BAL  80 mg/dL are more likely to deny suicidal ideation when they have a BAL < 80 mg/dL than patients with similar presenting complaints and no alcohol intoxication. This finding suggests confirmation of the common ED practice when assessing suicidal ideation in intoxicated individuals.","output":"Suicidal ideation and sobriety: Should acute alcohol intoxication be taken into account for psychiatric evaluation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online surveys of health professionals have become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 crisis because of their ease, speed of implementation, and low cost. This article leverages an online survey of general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes toward the soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines, implemented in October-November 2020 (before the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized in France), to study the evolution of the distribution of their demographic and professional characteristics and opinions about these vaccines, as the survey fieldwork progressed, as reminders were sent out to encourage them to participate. Focusing on the analysis of the potential determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, we also tested if factors related to survey participation biased the association estimates. Our results show that online surveys of health professionals may be subject to significant selection bias that can have a significant impact on estimates of the prevalence of some of these professionals' behavioral, opinion, or attitude variables. Our results also highlight the effectiveness of reminder strategies in reaching hard-to-reach professionals and reducing these biases.

The patients in the intervention group participated in a single session of suboccipital, anterior thoracic and sternal, anterior cervical, and diaphragm myofascial release techniques, plus respiratory physiotherapy. The controls just received respiratory physiotherapy. Before-after assessments included recording heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, chest expansion, and breathing comfort. Results: There was a significant reduction in the heart rate and ease of breathing in the intervention group (P=0.04, P=0.02;respectively);also, the diastolic blood pressure increased significantly in the control group (P=0.02). Compared to the controls, the ease of breathing decreased significantly in the intervention group (P=0.03). Conclusion: Myofascial release techniques of the neck, thoracic, and diaphragm, along with respiratory physiotherapy, could immediately affect heart rate and ease of breathing and prevent increasing diastolic blood pressure.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, anonymous, online, population-based survey questionnaire was administered to parents aged 21 years and above with children aged between 3 and 16 years attending pre-school, primary or secondary school (equivalent to kindergarten, middle and-high school) and residing in Singapore. Sleep duration in relation to various daily activities including academic activities, physical exercise, and screen time was evaluated pre-CB and during CB. RESULTS: Data from 593 participants were analyzed. Pre-CB, the overall mean (SD) sleep duration of the study population was 9.01 (1.18) hours on weekdays and 9.99 (0.94) hours on weekends. During CB, mean (SD) sleep duration overall was 9.63 (1.18) hours. Although children generally went to bed later (mean 0.65 h later), they woke up even later during CB (mean 1.27 h later), resulting in longer sleep duration (mean increase of 0.35 h). This was most evident in secondary school children (mean increase of 0.70 h). Children attending private schools (which had later start times) had increased sleep duration (mean 10.01 (SD 0.89) hours pre-CB and 10.05 (SD 0.93) hours during CB) compared to public schools (mean 9.05 (SD 0.91) pre-CB and 9.49 (SD 1.22) hours during CB).

Sleep apnoea causes hypoxaemia, and nocturnal oxygen desaturation is diagnostic in these patients. We tested the hypothesis that STOP-BANG score is associated with hypoxaemia after noncardiac surgery. METHODS This analysis was a sub-study of VISION, a prospective cohort study of perioperative cardiovascular events. With institutional review board approval, we included 630 patients in the final analysis. We assessed the association between the STOP-BANG score and postoperative hypoxaemia, defined as integrated area under the curve of [Formula: see text] saturation of 90% per h using median quantile regression. Secondarily, we selected a subset of STOP-BANG questions that best predicts postoperative hypoxaemia using 'Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator' method, and then assessed the association between the new score based on the selected questions and the primary outcome using quantile regression. RESULTS The median [q1, q3] area under [Formula: see text] of 90% per h was 0.09 [0.02, 0.39] %-h. The STOP-BANG score was not associated with hypoxaemia, with a multivariable slope coefficient of 0.002 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.01) %-h for a unit increase in the score (P=0.76).

Owing to their high specificity and reliability, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful tools to treat and detect numerous diseases. Hence, many researchers have begun to urgently develop Ab-based kits for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ab drugs for use as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. The detailed structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known, and since this protein is key for viral infection, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has become a major target for therapeutic Ab development. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a high mutation rate, especially under the selective pressure of aggressively deployed prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing Abs, the use of Ab cocktails is expected to be an important strategy for effective COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection may stimulate an overactive immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm that drives severe disease progression. Abs to combat cytokine storms have also been under intense development as treatments for COVID-19. In addition to their use as drugs, Abs are currently being utilized in SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, including antigen and immunoglobulin tests. Such Ab-based detection tests are crucial surveillance tools that can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Methods The study was conducted online on a Polish sample recruited through a social network site, a website, and snowball sampling. Body mass index (BMI) was used to assign the respondents to groups with normal or excess weight. We tested whether women enrolled in the study experienced weight-related stigmatization using two questions based on the concepts of spoiled identity and related to the obesity stigma. The Contour Drawing Rating Scale was used to study different aspects of the body image and discrepancies between them. The Self-Discrepancy Questionnaire was used to study the self-schemas associated with mental qualities. The Polish version of the Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale was applied to determine self-esteem level. Stereotypes concerning people with obesity were studied using the semantic differential method. Results Although excess weight was associated with weight-related stigmatization experiences, many women reported confronting such stigmatization even though their body weight was normal according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Women with excess weight and women with weight-related stigmatization experiences were characterized by larger discrepancies between the actual body image and the ideal, reflected, and ought body image, lower self-esteem, and more negative beliefs about their mental actual and reflected self compared to women with normal weight and without weight-related stigmatization experiences. The study participants from all groups tended to believe their actual body image to be ampler than the ideal and the ought body images. They also believed that other people perceived their mental qualities more positively than they did. The study groups were also characterized by negative stereotypes of people with obesity, although these stereotypes were more vital in women with excess weight and women who experienced weight-related stigmatization. Conclusion The study shows the similarity between psychological functioning of women with self-reported excess weight and those who experience weight-related stigma.

This depletion of HCWs may contribute to the epidemic's severity. To examine this issue, we explicitly model declining quality of care in four differential equation-based susceptible, infected and recovered-type models with vaccination. We assume that vaccination, recovery and survival rates are affected by quality of care delivered. We show that explicitly modelling HCWs and accounting for declining quality of care significantly alters model-predicted disease outcomes, specifically case counts and mortality. Models neglecting the decline of quality of care resulting from infection of HCWs may significantly under-estimate cases and mortality. These models may be useful to inform health policy that may differ for HCWs and the general population.

There are reports of autoimmune thyroiditis, and adrenal insufficiency in adults post-COVID-19. We describe the first pediatric report of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION A 14-year-old previously healthy girl, with vitiligo, presented in shock following one-week of fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and vomiting. Three weeks prior, she had congestion and fatigue, and known familial exposure for COVID-19. Labs were remarkable for sodium 129mmol/L, K 4.3mmol/L, creatinine 2.9mg/dL, hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL and positive COVID-19 PCR and SARS CoV-2 IgG. She was resuscitated with normal saline and required pressor support. EKG showed abnormal repolarization presumed secondary to myocarditis. She met criteria for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), received intravenous immune globulin and IL-1R antagonist, and was admitted for intensive care. Persistent hypotension despite improved inflammatory markers, and an undetectable cortisol led to initiation of hydrocortisone. She was then able to rapidly wean off vasopressors and hydrocortisone within 48 hours. Thereafter, tests undertaken for persistent bradycardia confirmed autoimmune hypothyroidism with TSH 131mcunit/ml, freeT4 0.85ng/dL, and positive thyroid autoantibodies. Basal and stimulated cortisol were <1 mcg/dL on a standard 250mcg cosyntropin stimulation test, with baseline ACTH >1250pg/mL confirming primary adrenal insufficiency. Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and fludrocortisone. Adrenal sonogram did not reveal any hemorrhage and anti-adrenal antibody titers were positive. The family retrospectively reported oligomenorrhea, increased salt craving in the months prior, and family history of autoimmune thyroiditis. The cytokine panel was notably different from other cases of MIS-C. CONCLUSION This is the first pediatric report, to our knowledge, of primary adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism following COVID-19, leading to a unique presentation of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2. The initial presentation was attributed to MIS-C, but the subsequent clinical course suggests the possibility of adrenal crisis.

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe and interferes with the provision of dental care for many individuals from different communities and backgrounds. A search for the literature on PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from March 1, 2020 to December 30, 2020 was conducted. Also, the bibliographies included in the indicated articles were used to identify further literature. Recommendations by health authorities in different countries were also consulted. RESULTS: COVID-19 is causing many fatalities and is disrupting people's daily life and the economy in many countries around the world. Due to the potential of cross-infection through dental treatments, especially dental aerosol generation procedures, the dental profession has been disrupted during this pandemic. Dental care provision has been ceased completely or partially (limited to emergency or urgent treatment) in most countries around the world. Until this pandemic is controlled by new suitable treatments and/or vaccination, there is an urgent need to adopt immediate guidelines and standards for the safe provision of dental care to meet patients' demands, especially for the dental aerosols. CONCLUSION: Guidelines and standards for dental treatment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic are required. This manuscript provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic from dental perspectives and presents standards and guidelines of dental care provision based on available research in this field as well as clinical experience and practice. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript provides guidelines and standards for dental treatment and clinical management within dental settings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and resembles part of the quest to set the golden standards for dental care during the current circumstances.

Analyses have been carried out on responses of teachers in order to determine the factors affecting them, so as to illustrate an example and to try to understand the impacts of decisions taken by the Turkish Ministry of National Education during the initial stages of the pandemic. The study follows a descriptive survey model and employs quota sampling based on the first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics of Turkey. 1071 teachers participated in the study on a voluntary basis during the 30 March-1 June 2020 period by filling out a questionnaire form developed by the researchers. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of data were carried out via SPSS 24 and NVIVO 10 software, respectively. Findings indicate the most prominent problems reported by teachers are the lack of internet/device access by students as well as lack of experience of teachers with distance education. Analyses of problem frequency based on demographics have revealed that female teachers were more likely to suffer from the lack of IT skills. Teachers in the age group of 41+, who belong to generation X, also tend to experience more problems due to the lack of IT skills in comparison with their younger peers. Moreover, issues such as internet and infrastructure inadequacies experienced in rural regions, low participation rate of students in the online courses, indifference of parents, and failure of teachers to be sufficiently active in the system, were considered as problems by the teachers;and solution suggestions have been presented accordingly. ? 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz.

Compared to adults, children have infrequent severe manifestations of acute infection but are uniquely at risk for the rare and often severe Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) following infection. We hypothesized that these differences in presentation are related to differences in the magnitude and/or antigen specificity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell (CST) responses between adults and children. We therefore set out to measure the CST response in convalescent adults versus children with and without MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CSTs were expanded from blood collected from convalescent children and adults post SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated by intracellular flow cytometry, surface markers, and cytokine production following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides. Presence of serum/plasma antibody to spike and nucleocapsid was measured using the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay. FINDINGS: Twenty-six of 27 MIS-C patients, 7 of 8 non-MIS-C convalescent children, and 13 of 14 adults were seropositive for spike and nucleocapsid antibody. CST responses in MIS-C patients were significantly higher than children with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection, but weaker than CST responses in convalescent adults. INTERPRETATION: Age-related differences in the magnitude of CST responses suggest differing post-infectious immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in children compared to adults post uncomplicated infection. Children with MIS-C have CST responses that are stronger than children with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection and weaker than convalescent adults, despite near uniform seropositivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Specific T Cell Responses Are Stronger in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Compared to Children With Uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Band 3 (anion exchanger 1 - AE1) is the most abundant membrane protein in red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant cell in the human body. A compelling model, based on indirect evidence, posits that - at high oxygen saturation - the N-term cytosolic domain of AE1 binds to and inhibits glycolytic enzymes, thus diverting metabolic fluxes to the pentose phosphate pathway to generate reducing equivalents. Dysfunction of this mechanism occurs during RBC aging or storage under blood bank conditions, suggesting a role for AE1 in the regulation of blood storage quality and efficacy of transfusion C a life-saving intervention for millions of recipients worldwide. Here we leverage two murine models carrying genetic ablations of AE1 to provide the first direct mechanistic evidence of its role in metabolic regulation and blood storage quality. Observations in mice phenocopied those in a human subject lacking expression of AE11-11 (band 3 Neapolis), while common polymorphisms in the region coding for AE11-56 increased susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis in healthy blood donors. Through thermal proteome profiling and cross-linking proteomics, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the RBC interactome, with a focus on AE11-56 and validate recombinant AE1 interactions with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

In 2014, an international outbreak of EV-D68 occurred and caused severe respiratory disease in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of children admitted to Children's Mercy Hospital from August 1-September 15, 2014 with positive multiplex PCR testing for enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV). Specimens were subsequently tested for EV-D68, and clinical data were obtained from the medical records. Patients with EV-D68 were compared with children presenting simultaneously with other EV/RV. RESULTS Of 542 eligible specimens, children with EV-D68 were significantly older than children with other EV/RV (4.6 vs. 2.2 years, P<0.001). Children with EV-D68 were more likely to have a history of asthma (38.6% vs. 30.0%, P=0.04) or recurrent wheezing (22.1% vs. 14.8%, P=0.04). EV-D68 positive children more commonly received supplemental oxygen (86.7% vs. 65.0%, P<0.001), albuterol (91.2% vs. 65.5%, P<0.001), and corticosteroids (82.9% vs. 58.6%, P<0.001). Age 5 years was an independent risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) management in EV-D68 infected children. Children with a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing and EV-D68 received supplemental oxygen (92.7% vs. 82.4%, P=0.007) and magnesium (42.7% vs. 29.7%, P=0.03) at higher rates and more continuous albuterol (3 vs. 2 hours, P=0.03) than those with other EV/RV. CONCLUSIONS EV-D68 causes severe disease in the pediatric population, particularly in children with a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing.

We examined the influenza season 2017/18 in terms of hospitalisation and mortality in the Austrian paediatric population and put the results into perspective of the available data from the last 15 years. METHODS: Cases of influenza-associated hospitalisations and deaths for season 2017/18 in children below 18 years were retrospectively collected from 12 and 33 Austrian hospitals, respectively. Hospitalisation and mortality rates for the whole Austrian paediatric population were estimated, adjusting for the population in each catchment area. Two Austrian databases were queried for hospitalisations and deaths associated with influenza during 2002C2016. Rough estimate of the vaccination coverage was calculated from a survey on 100 inpatients. RESULTS: Influenza-related paediatric hospitalisation rate in season 2017/18 was estimated as 128 (CI: 122C135) per 100,000 children, much higher than the national average of 40 per 100,000 over the years 2002C2016. There were nine reported influenza-associated deaths among children, resulting in mortality rate of 0.67 (CI: 0.32C1.21) per 100,000 children.

There is uncertainty regarding risks of virus aerosolization and laparoscopic surgery. This narrative review discusses these concerns of virus exposure and transmission for health care workers in the operating room by summarizing currently available recommendations and describing our institution's experience. Our virology review was performed by compiling published data on various viruses' presence in blood, peritoneal fluid and surgical smoke. Our recommendations review was performed by researching official organizational guidelines and medical archives (medRxiv) pre-prints. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of other viruses to form aerosol particles in peritoneal fluid and surgical smoke. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are considered important risks for nosocomial transmission of viruses, but there is no consensus to include all surgical procedures as so. Most local and international organizations highlight the concerns surrounding laparoscopy, but are not strictly discouraging this modality. They recommend proceeding with caution to minimize surgical smoke exposure by ensuring the use of filtration systems, tight air-seals and fewer incisions. We can extrapolate from other viruses that SARS-CoV-2 may present a potential infectious risk in the operating room. Until evidence arises otherwise, we recommend considering all surgical procedures to be aerosolizing. Laparoscopy continues to be a safe and appropriate modality. Full airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) should be utilized in all emergent cases, and droplet PPE only in urgent elective cases for asymptomatic, screen- and test-negative patients.","output":"The status of laparoscopic surgery in the COVID-19 crisis: a narrative review of current recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pain is frequently encountered in the intensive care setting. Given the impact of pain assessment on patient outcomes and length of hospital stay, studies have been conducted to validate tools, establish guidelines and cast light on practices relating to pain assessment. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent, range and nature of the evidence around pain assessment practices in adult patients who cannot self-report pain in the intensive care setting and summarise the findings from a heterogenous body of evidence to aid in the planning and the conduct of future research and management of patient care. The specific patient cohort studied was the sedated/ ventilated patient within the intensive care setting. DESIGN A scoping review protocol utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping review checklist (PRISMA-ScR). METHODS The review comprised of five phases: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Databases were systematically searched from January to April 2020. Databases included were Scopus, Web of Science, Medline via Ovid, CINAHL COMPLETE via EBSCO host, Health Source and PUBMED. Limits were applied on dates (2000 to current), language (English), subject (human) and age (adult). Key words used were \\"pain\\", \\"assessment\\", \\"measurement\\", \\"tools\\", \\"instruments\\", \\"practices\\", \\"sedated\\", \\"ventilated\\", \\"adult\\". A hand search technique was used to search citations within articles. Database alerts were set to apprise the availability of research articles pertaining to pain assessment practices in the intensive care setting. RESULTS The review uncovered literature categorised under five general themes: behaviour pain assessment tools, pain assessment guidelines, position statements and quality improvement projects, enablers and barriers to pain assessment, and evidence appertaining to actual practices. Behaviour pain assessment tools are the benchmark for pain assessment of sedated and ventilated patients. The reliability and validity of physiologic parameters to assess pain is yet to be determined. Issues of compliance with pain assessment guidelines and tools exist and impact on practices. In some countries like Australia, there is a dearth of information regarding the prevalence and characteristics of patients receiving analgesia, type of analgesia used, pain assessment practices and the process of recording pain management. In general, pain assessment varies across different intensive care settings and lacks consistency.

All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. AIM: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. RESULTS: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked.

Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries.

Our data demonstrated that after 24 h of intraperitoneal administration of PSPD-2002 (at 580 g/kg) the animals did not present alterations in their locomotor, anxiolytic-like, or anxiety-like behavior (in the open field test), nor antidepressant-like or depressive behavior in the forced swimming test. However, the C57Bl/6 J mice exposed to PSPD-2002 showed memory deficit in the novel object recognition task, which was associated with higher production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, as well as the increased suppression of acetylcholinesterase brain activity, compared to Swiss mice also exposed to peptide fragments. In Swiss mice the reduction in the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the brain was not associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers (hydrogen peroxide), suggesting that other antioxidant mechanisms may have been activated by exposure to PSPD-2002 to maintain the animals' brain redox homeostasis.

Infection is spread by both known cases and hidden, undetected asymptomatic cases. Asymptomatic individuals are people who transmit the virus but display no clinical symptoms. Current evidence reveals that this population is a major contributing factor to the spread of the disease. There is little or no knowledge of the scale of the hidden prevalence of all infections both asymptomatic and symptomatic in Ireland. Furthermore, as governments plan for the roll out of imminent immunisation programmes, the need to know the scale of the hidden prevalence and hence knowledge of the level of immunisation required is essential. We describe and analyse the numbers of reported cases of COVID-19 in Ireland from the first case in February 2020 to mid-December 2020. Using the method of back-calculation we provide estimates of the asymptomatic prevalence of cases from June to December 2020. The descriptive analysis highlighted two epidemic waves of known cases in the time period. Wave two from June to December included twice as many cases as wave one and cases were significantly younger. The back-calculation estimates of asymptomatic prevalence during this time period revealed that for every case known there was an additional unknown case and total prevalence in wave two was estimated to be approximately 95,000 as opposed to the reported 48,390 cases. As prevalence in wave two is known to be spreading within and from younger age groups the role of mixing patterns on spread needs to be disseminated to the wider public to adequately inform them how personal modifications in behaviour can contribute to the control of the epidemic. While universally imposed lockdowns and mitigation measures may be essential, personal behavioural mixing choices are powerful protectors.","output":"The second wave: estimating the hidden asymptomatic prevalence of COVID-19 in Ireland as we plan for imminent immunisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Controversies exist on the nature of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in particular on the static compliance of the respiratory system (Crs). We aimed to analyze the association of Crs with outcome in COVID-19-associated ARDS, to ascertain its determinants and to describe its evolution at day-14. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, Crs was measured at day-1 and day-14. Association between Crs or Crs/ideal body weight (IBW) and breathing without assistance at day-28 was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Determinants were ascertained by multivariable linear regression. Day-14 Crs was compared to day-1 Crs with paired t-test in patients still under controlled mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The mean Crs in 372 patients was 37.6  13 mL/cmH2O, similar to as in ARDS of other causes. Multivariate linear regression identified chronic hypertension, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, low PEEP, and low tidal volume as associated with lower Crs/IBW. After adjustment on confounders, nor Crs [OR 1.0 (CI 95% 0.98-1.02)] neither Crs/IBW [OR 0.63 (CI 95% 0.13-3.1)] were associated with the chance of breathing without assistance at day-28 whereas plateau pressure was [OR 0.93 (CI 95% 0.88-0.99)]. In a subset of 108 patients, day-14 Crs decreased compared to day-1 Crs (31.2  14.4 mL/cmH2O vs 37.8  11.4 mL/cmH2O, p < 0.001). The decrease in Crs was not associated with day-28 outcome. CONCLUSION: In a large multicenter cohort of moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS, mean Crs was decreased below 40 mL/cmH2O and was not associated with day-28 outcome.

In a community sample of young adults (n=996, aged 18-30) assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated gendered patterns in NSSI etiology. METHODS Mediation and moderation analyses considered associations between past-year NSSI prevalence, gender, and putative mechanistic variables: self-reported psychological distress (K10), emotion dysregulation (DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS-P). RESULTS Nearly twice as many women as men reported past-year NSSI (14.47% versus 7.78%). Women reported significantly higher psychological distress and significantly lower sensation seeking and positive urgency than men. Psychological distress partially statistically mediated the relationship between gender and past-year NSSI. Gender did not significantly moderate associations between self-reported distress, emotion dysregulation, or impulsivity and past-year NSSI. Past-year NSSI prevalence did not significantly decrease with age and we found no significant age by gender interaction. CONCLUSIONS Greater levels of NSSI in young women are explained by their greater levels of emotional distress. Women do not appear to be more likely than men to report NSSI due to differences in how they manage emotional distress: gender did not moderate the association between psychological distress and past-year NSSI, and there were no gender differences in emotion dysregulation or negative urgency. Furthermore, we show that NSSI remains prevalent beyond adolescence. Early interventions which reduce distress or improve distress tolerance, strengthen emotion regulation skills, and provide alternative coping strategies merit investigation for NSSI.","output":"Why is non-suicidal self-injury more prevalent among women?

Furthermore, we examine the empirical evidence on the relationship between QQI scores and participants interactions. Finally, we visualize network structures via sociograms and hierarchically cluster participants to identify subgroups. Our analysis of 281 messages finds that recommendations helped participants to write more messages that compared alternative viewpoints and refined preliminary ideas with higher QQI scores.

The oral cavity is referred to as a target of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to review oral symptoms specific to COVID-19 patients from the point of view of symptom prevalence and pathogenesis and to speculate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying them. Scientific articles were retrieved by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from 3 February 2020 to 31 December 2020, and they were reviewed by title, abstract, and text for relevance. The literature search indicated that COVID-19 patients frequently present with gustatory dysfunction, xerostomia, and oral mucosal lesions, while their prevalence is likely to vary by country, age, gender, and disease severity. Gustatory dysfunction and xerostomia appear at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection and last relatively long. One of possible pathogenic mechanisms of both symptoms is attributed to the expression of viral cellular entry-relevant receptors in taste cells and salivary glands.

This includes disruption to the healthcare system that supports a disaster-affected community. Nurses are important members of disaster response teams. However, there is limited literature that describes nurses roles or experience in responding to disasters. Aim This paper employs a phenomenological approach to uncover moments of being an Australian civilian hospital nurse in the out-of-hospital environment following a disaster. Method This study uncovers moments of what it is like being an Australian civilian hospital nurse deployed to the out-of-hospital environment following a disaster. Individual interviews were undertaken at two points in time with each participant. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to textual narratives, which was then analysed. Several activities were undertaken to uncover moments and provide exemplars of moments, from the narrative. Findings Eight hospital nurses participated in this study. Five moments were uncovered: on the way to a disaster, prior to starting work, working a shift in a disaster, end of a shift, and returning home. Each moment has its uniqueness and singularity exemplifying an experience of nurses in the out-of-hospital disaster environment. Discussion When compared to a hospital context, assisting during and/or following a disaster in the out-of-hospital environment is challenging. For example, nurses may need to do more with less resources, provide more frequent psychosocial support for more extenuating circumstances, and experience an unsettling return home at the end of the deployment. Conclusions This paper has provided new insights into what it may be like being an Australian civilian hospital nurse in the out-of-hospital disaster environment as part of a disaster medical assistance teams. Strategies to support nurses who assist during and/or following a disaster are important, so nurses can in turn provide care to people in disaster-affected communities.","output":"Phenomenology of Australian civilian hospital nurses lived experiences of the out-of-hospital environment following a disaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review discusses the neurological complications associated with myocarditis of different etiologies. RECENT FINDINGS: Myocarditis can be idiopathic or caused by different conditions, including toxins, infections, or inflammatory diseases.

Several neurologic manifestations can be seen in association with myocarditis. Tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and myocyte dysfunction can result in heart failure and arrhythmias leading to intracardiac thrombus formation and cardioembolism. In addition, peripheral neuropathies, status epilepticus, or myasthenia gravis have been reported in association with specific types of myocarditis.

DESIGN: 50 semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. SETTING: A safety-net hospital in Denver, Colorado. PARTICIPANTS: Interdisciplinary frontline clinicians including physicians, advance practice providers, nurses, respiratory therapists and paramedics providing inpatient hospital care to patients hospitalised for COVID-19. RESULTS: Fifty clinicians (32 women and 18 men) participated. Five themes with respective subthemes (in parentheses) were identified: depersonalisation and barriers to care (impeding rapport and compassion, focusing on infection risk at the expense of high-quality care, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation), powerless in uncertainty (inescapable awareness of personal risk, therapeutic doubt in a void of evidence, confronting ethical dilemmas, struggling with dynamic and unfamiliar challenges), overwhelmed and exhausted (burden of personal protective equipment (PPE), information overload and confusion, overstretched by additional responsibilities at work, compounded by personal life stressors, feeling vulnerable and dispensable, compassion fatigue, distress from the disproportionate impact on socially oppressed communities), bolstering morale and confidence (motivated by community and family support, equipped with data), and driven by moral duty (responsibility to patient care and community, collegial solidarity and collaboration, contributing to the greater good). CONCLUSION: Frontline clinicians reported distress due to the challenges of PPE, uncertainty and powerlessness, new responsibilities at work and home, losing control of their schedules, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation and witnessing healthcare disparities exacerbated by this pandemic. Clinicians feel supported by their colleagues, families, and community and were driven by a sense of moral duty.

This study assesses PM2.5 exposure and health risk during COVID-19, and its driving factors have been analyzed using spatiotemporal big data, including Tencent location-based services (LBS) data, place of interest (POI), and PM2.5 site monitoring data. Specifically, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) is utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentration firstly. Then, population exposure and health risks of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 epidemic have been assessed based on LBS data. To further understand the driving factors of PM2.5 pollution, the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and POI data has been quantitatively analyzed using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show the time series coefficients of monthly PM2.5 concentrations distributed with a U-shape, i.e., with a decrease followed by an increase from January to December. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration shows a noteworthy decline over the Central and North China. The LBS-based population density distribution indicates that the health risk of PM2.5 in the west is significantly lower than that in the Middle East. Urban gross domestic product (GDP) and urban green area are negatively correlated with PM2.5; while, road area, urban taxis, urban buses, and urban factories are positive.

Reduced plasma cathelicidin concentrations are independently associated with worse pulmonary outcomes in current and former smokers. This study aimed to determine whether oral vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficient current smokers increases plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cathelicidin levels. Methods Vitamin D deficient (25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) <20 ng/ml) smokers (n=17) underwent collection of plasma and BAL for cathelicidin and 25OHD measurements before and after eight weeks of oral supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly. Differences between baseline and eight-week levels of cathelicidin and 25OHD in blood and BAL were assessed along with correlations between serum 25OHD, plasma cathelicidin and BAL cathelicidin. Results At baseline, there was no correlation between BAL and plasma cathelicidin. There was a significant increase in 25OHD (median 17.0 to 43.3 ng/mL, p<0.001) after eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation. There was no change in plasma cathelicidin (p=0.86), BAL cathelicidin (p=0.31), or BAL 25OHD (p=0.89). There was no correlation between serum 25OHD and either BAL or plasma cathelicidin post-supplementation. Conclusion Oral vitamin D supplementation, while increasing serum 25OHD levels, does not increase plasma or BAL cathelicidin levels in vitamin D deficient active smokers.

However, considerable variation in the prevalence estimates of comorbidities and their effects on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have been observed in prior studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine geographical, age, and gender related differences in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated severity and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. We conducted a search using PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to include all COVID-19 studies published between January 1st, 2020 to July 24th, 2020 reporting comorbidities with severity or mortality. We included studies reporting the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 on human patients that also provided information on comorbidities or disease outcomes. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects method for calculating estimates. Of 120 studies with 125,446 patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (32%), obesity (25%), diabetes (18%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) while chronic kidney or other renal diseases (51%, 44%), cerebrovascular accident (43%, 44%), and cardiovascular disease (44%, 40%) patients had more COVID-19 severity and mortality respectively. Considerable variation in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated disease severity and mortality in different geographic regions was observed. The highest mortality was observed in studies with Latin American and European patients with any medical condition, mostly older adults (&#8805; 65 years), and predominantly male patients. Although the US studies observed the highest prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, the severity of COVID-19 among each comorbid condition was highest in Asian studies whereas the mortality was highest in the European and Latin American countries. Risk stratification and effective control strategies for the COVID-19 should be done according to comorbidities, age, and gender differences specific to geographical location.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of geographic differences in comorbidities and associated severity and mortality among individuals with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unemployment has risen as the economy has shrunk. The coronavirus crisis has affected many sectors in Romania, some companies diminishing or even ceasing their activity. Making forecasts of the unemployment rate has a fundamental impact and importance on future social policy strategies. The aim of the paper is to comparatively analyze the forecast performances of different univariate time series methods with the purpose of providing future predictions of unemployment rate. In order to do that, several forecasting models (seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), Holt-Winters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal), and NNAR (neural network autoregression)) have been applied, and their forecast performances have been evaluated on both the in-sample data covering the period January 2000-December 2017 used for the model identification and estimation and the out-of-sample data covering the last three years, 2018-2020. The forecast of unemployment rate relies on the next two years, 2021-2022. Based on the in-sample forecast assessment of different methods, the forecast measures root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) suggested that the multiplicative Holt-Winters model outperforms the other models. For the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models, RMSE and MAE values revealed that the NNAR model has better forecasting performance, while according to MAPE, the SARIMA model registers higher forecast accuracy. The empirical results of the Diebold-Mariano test at one forecast horizon for out-of-sample methods revealed differences in the forecasting performance between SARIMA and NNAR, of which the best model of modeling and forecasting unemployment rate was considered to be the NNAR model.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Different Univariate Forecasting Methods in Modelling and Predicting the Romanian Unemployment Rate for the Period 2021-2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The treatment of transsphincteric anal fistulas is a challenge between recurrence rate and incontinence. Many surgical and conservative procedures have been described in the treatment of anal fistulas. Fistulectomy and primary sphincter reconstruction (FPSR) has not gained great popularity in this field due to the risk of sphincter damage. The aim of this study is to evaluate FPSR in the treatment of transsphincteric fistulas. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 50 patients with high transsphincteric fistulas of cryptoglandular origin that were treated with FPSR between 2005 and 2008. Preoperative assessment included physical and proctologic examination. Continence and pain scores were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS In our 50 patients, 22 patients (44 %) had a previous proctologic operation and 11 patients (22 %) presented with recurrent fistulas. The fistulas existed for an average of 8 months. The operation time was 28  16 min. Mean follow-up was 22 months. The fistula healed in 44 patients (88 %) who developed no recurrence. In five patients (10 %), the fistula healed, but they developed a recurrence in the observation period. In one patient (2 %), the fistula did not heal. Three patients developed low-grade incontinence for flatus, and one patient with 2 incontinence improved. Preoperatively and postoperatively calculated continence and pain scores showed a slight but significant elevation in the Clinical Continence Score, the German Society of Coloproctology Score showed no significant difference, and preexisting pain was reduced significantly by surgery. CONCLUSIONS FPSR is a safe surgical procedure for the treatment of high transsphincteric anal fistula.

HRSVs were detected in 97 of the 2,416 (4.0%) specimens, and among the positive specimens, 38 (39.2%) were identified as HRSV-A and 59 (60.8%) as HRSV-B. During the study periods, HRSV-B predominated in all seasons, except in 2016/17 during which HRSV-A predominated. Depending on the age groups, HRSV prevalence was the highest in 0- to 2-year-old patients. Comparison of non-infected subjects with HRSV-infected subjects revealed that HRSV infection more frequently resulted in fever, nasal obstruction, and wheezing, although the frequency of sore throat was low; however, comparison of the symptoms between HRSV-A- and HRSV-B-infected patients revealed no significant differences in symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HRSV-A patients had an ON1 genotype, and all HRSV-B patients had an BA9 genotype.

Sterile techniques, like catheterization, are invasive, can be traumatizing to children, and are time consuming to complete. A two-step approach has been shown to reduce the catheterization rate in febrile, young children without unintended consequences. Objectives Our aim was to implement a two-step approach for UTI screening in febrile children 6-24 months in order to decrease unnecessary urine catheterizations by 50% without impacting ED length of stay (LOS) or return visits (RVs). Design/Methods After engaging key stakeholders and a nursing champion, we created a process map to understand the current urine collection process in our ED, and areas for targeted improvement. Using the model for improvement, we adopted a 2-step pathway for a suspected UTI in children 6-24 months as our change idea. The pathway involved identifying children who met inclusion criteria for UTI screening, followed by urine bag application and urinalysis (UA) if clinically indicated. Only if the UA was positive, a second urine sample was collected via catheterization, for repeat UA and culture. Through multiple PDSA cycles, our pathway was implemented in the ED along with concurrent staff education. The outcome measure was the rate of ED urine catheterizations. Process measures included the total number of urine cultures sent to microbiology and percent positivity. The balancing measures included ED LOS and RVs. Results Since project initiation in July 2019, the ED catheterization rate decreased from 73% to 53% (Figure 1) and the number of urine cultures sent to Microbiology decreased by 23%. The number of urine cultures sent to Microbiology decreased by 23% with a mild improvement in the positivity rate by 2% (Figure 2). There was no significant change in RVs. There was a slight 10-min increase in ED LOS, most likely confounded by the COVID pandemic. Conclusion Using improvement methodology, we successfully decreased the number of unnecessary catheterizations in children and the number of urine cultures sent to microbiology. Further refinements to our intervention are ongoing and include optimizing urine screening equipment in patient rooms, poster reminders, re-education for providers, and introducing a parent resource explaining the 2-step pathway. This improvement work is also being spread to the paediatric wards and can easily be adopted by other paediatric centres. It has also been adapted by the Choosing Wisely hospital campaign.","output":"Decreasing invasive urinary tract infection screening in a paediatric emergency department: A quality improvement initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For controlling the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections, the Bangladesh Government imposed lockdown to ensure social distancing among the mass. The study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on social relationships among Bangladeshi nationals.

The study used a survey questionnaire to ascertain the people's perception on COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown, and on how the lockdown affected their social relationships. In this study, social relationships referred to the connections between family members, friends, and relatives. Linear regression was employed to determine the predictors of social relationships. A total of 352 survey responses were collected, out of which 64.2 per cent reported that their social relationships became stronger during lockdown. Age, marital status, occupation, and financial condition exhibited significant associations with social relationships. More specifically, young through middle-aged, married, housewives, and financially solvent people had a significant association with having strong social relationships. This study found that the COVID-19 lockdown revealed a positive impact on the social relationships of Bangladeshis.

Here, we evaluated the lineages circulating in 29 cities in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Southern Brazil between March 2020 and May 2021 and investigated the genetic events associated with the emergence of the P.1. A total of 202 oro/nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 specimens from patients during routine hospital care were submitted to whole-genome sequencing. Phylogenetic and Bayesian Evolutionary Analyses of the P.1 lineage were carried out to determine the relationship between sequences from RS and AM and dated their common ancestor and origin. One hundred six (53%) sequences were assigned as P.1 and most carried the 22 lineage-defining mutations. All the P.1 sequences included other important mutations, such as P314L and R203K/G204R, and revealed a high genetic diversity in the phylogenetic tree. The time-scaled inference suggests that the oldest P.1 sequences from different Brazilian states share a ancestor with those from AM, but the origin of some sequences from RS is unknown. Further, the common ancestor of sequences from RS is dated to mid-June/July 2020, earlier than those previously reported from AM. Our results demonstrate that there is a high degree of genetic diversity among P.1 sequences, which suggests a continuous evolution and community spread of the virus. Although the first P.1 outbreak was reported in AM, the lineage was associated with multiple introductory events and had already been circulating in Southern Brazil prior to November 2020. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 P.1 lineage is associated with increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion and presents a dynamic evolution in Brazil. The significance of our research relies in the fact that we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Southern Brazil between March 2020 and May 2021. This evaluation allowed us to detect the genetic events associated with the emergence of the P.1 and its sublineages. This study is important because we were able to establish that the common ancestor of P.1 sequences from Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, is dated of mid-June/July 2020, earlier than the P.1 sequences previously reported from Amazonas (AM) state. Noteworthy, the high degree of genetic diversity among P.1 sequences found in this study suggests a continuous evolution and community spread of the virus.

Another objective was to examine existing literature on eHealth interventions and challenges within FACT teams. METHODS: We have examined Norwegian policy regulating mental health services, laws and regulations, eHealth infrastructure, relevant literature on FACT teams, and current implementation of FACT in Norway. RESULTS: FACT teams are a wanted part of the Norwegian service system, but the current eHealth infrastructure makes sharing of data within teams and levels of health care challenging, even if eHealth regulations allow such sharing. This has been shown to be an issue in the current implementation of FACT teams in Norway. There is little or no existing research on the eHealth challenges facing FACT teams.

The investigation was conducted in a single-center cohort of 5,359 consecutive first kidney transplants with adult deceased donors performed on non-prioritized adult recipients from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2017. Death censored graft survival and patient survival were lower in older donors, whereas graft survival was higher and patient survival was lower in old recipients. The analyses of combinations of donor and recipient ages showed that death censored graft survival was lower in younger recipients in transplants from 18 to 59-year old donors, with standard or extended criteria, but no difference in graft survival was observed between younger and older recipients when the donor was &#8805; 60-year old. Patient survival was higher in younger recipients in transplants with younger or older donors. Two to six HLA-A,B,DR mismatches, when compared to 0-1 MM, conferred risk for death-censored graft survival only in transplants from younger donors to younger recipients.

Since its discovery, mesothelin, a cell surface protein, has been a promising biomarker and therapeutic target due to its overexpression in mesothelioma and limited expression in normal cells. This review summarizes the clinical studies that have examined mesothelin as a biomarker and therapeutic target in mesothelioma and explores future perspectives in its role to improve patient management. ABSTRACT: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. MPM originates from the mesothelial lining of the pleura. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a glycoprotein expressed at low levels in normal tissues and at high levels in MPM. Many other solid cancers overexpress MSLN, and this is associated with worse survival rates. However, this association has not been found in MPM, and the exact biological role of MSLN in MPM requires further exploration. Here, we discuss the current research on the diagnostic and prognostic value of MSLN in MPM patients. Furthermore, MSLN has become an attractive immunotherapy target in MPM, where better treatment strategies are urgently needed. Several MSLN-targeted monoclonal antibodies, antibodyCdrug conjugates, immunotoxins, cancer vaccines, and cellular therapies have been tested in the clinical setting. The biological rationale underpinning MSLN-targeted immunotherapies and their potential to improve MPM patient outcomes are reviewed.","output":"Hitting the Bulls-Eye: Mesothelins Role as a Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions globally.

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population-based IFR. METHODS Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood 6 April to 3 May were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas, and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. Seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS The first 20 640 blood donors were tested, and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, .8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers, a combined IFR in patients <70 years is estimated at 89 per 100 000 (95% CI, 72-211) infections. CONCLUSIONS The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely severalfold lower than the current estimate.

In adults, steroid treatment shortens time to clinical stabilisation without an increase in complications in patients with CAP. However, despite promising data from observational studies, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of steroids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The KIDS-STEP trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial of betamethasone treatment on outcome of hospitalised children with CAP. Children are enrolled in paediatric emergency departments of hospitals across Switzerland and randomised to adjunct oral betamethasone for 2 days or matching placebo in addition to standard of care treatment. The co-primary outcomes are the proportion of children clinically stable 48 hours after randomisation and the proportion of children with CAP-related readmission within 28 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, time away from routine childcare and healthcare utilisation and total antibiotic prescriptions within 28 days from randomisation. Each of the co-primary outcomes will be analysed separately. We will test clinical stability rates using a proportion test; to test non-inferiority in readmission rates, we will construct 1? % CI of the estimated difference and test if it contains the pre-defined margin of 7%.

Since endocytosis and vesicle trafficking are fundamental pathways for nephrocytes, the objective here is to assess the role of the RPH3A ortholog in Drosophila, Rabphilin (Rph), in the structure and function of nephrocytes. We have confirmed that Rph is required for the endocytic pathway to function correctly in pericardial Drosophila nephrocytes. Knockdown of Rph reduces the expression of cubilin and stick and stones genes, which encode proteins that are involved in protein uptake and filtration. We also found that reduced Rph expression results in a disappearance of the labyrinthine channel structure and a reduction in the number of endosomes, which ultimately leads to changes in the number and volume of nephrocytes. Finally, we described that administration of retinoic acid to IR-Rph nephrocytes rescued some altered aspects as the filtration and molecular uptake as well as the maintenance of cell fate. According to our data, Rph is crucial for the nephrocyte's filtration and reabsorption and it is required for the maintenance of the nephrocyte's ultrastructure, integrity, and differentiation.","output":"Rabphilin involvement in filtration and molecular uptake in Drosophila nephrocytes suggests a similar role in human podocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multimorbidity, defined as the concurrent experience of more than one chronic health condition in an individual, affects 65% of people over 65 and 85% of those over 85 years old with 30% of those also experiencing mental health concerns.

Digital health interventions offer a viable means of condition self-management, as well as psychological support, particularly for those who may have difficulty accessing in-person services. To best meet the needs of older adults with multimorbidity, deeper insights are needed into their specific concerns and issues around condition management, particularly with regard to distress in relation to managing one's condition. The present study aimed to explore this using one-to-one qualitative interviews and focus groups with people with chronic health conditions and healthcare professionals. Participants were 11 older adults with multimorbidity (4 males; mean age: M = 72.7 years) and 14 healthcare professionals including five clinical nurse specialists, four pharmacists, two general practitioners, one occupational therapist, one speech and language therapist and one dietician. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes, which included: patient feelings of anxiety or worry leading to an unwillingness to access essential information; the various mental health challenges faced by those with multimorbidity; the importance of personal values in providing motivation; and the importance of social support.

In diabetic individuals, dysregulated inflammation contributes to delayed wound healing. Specific immunomodulatory agents may have a role in the treatment of diabetic wounds. One of these molecules is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.). Although interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, little is known about the local use this drug in cutaneous wound healing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of locally administered interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on delayed wound healing, specifically, in a diabetic mouse model. Two 6-mm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsa of diabetic (db/db) mice and stented. One-hour postwounding, wound margins were subcutaneously injected with either (1) low-dose interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in a gelatin-transglutaminase gel vehicle or (2) the gel vehicle only. Wounds were imaged on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 postwounding, and wound area was determined. Wound biopsies were collected on day 21 and immunohistochemically stained for neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Wounds treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist had significantly smaller wound area than nontreated wounds on day 7 and day 14 postwounding. Treated wounds also showed significantly less neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. These findings support the hypothesis that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist may have an important role in cutaneous wound healing, possibly by promoting successful resolution of acute inflammation and hence accelerating wound closure.

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of ED staff required to wear N95s continuously throughout their shifts. Subjects were doctors, nurses, and technicians who were previously fitted for their assigned N95 by employee health. Subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts. Investigators filled out a questionnaire for each subject noting the hours of continuous N95 wear. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen N95s were evaluated, with 23 failures at first testing. These were not retested. Twenty-seven N95s passed at the start of a shift and did not have repeat testing during the course of the shift. These were excluded from further analysis. Seventeen N95s passed testing after several hours of continuous wear, but only had a single fit test done partway or at the end of a shift. These were assumed to have passed if tested at shift start, and were assigned as passes for continuous use. Forty-six N95s had an initial pass and were evaluated for continuous use, of which 6 subsequently failed later in the shift, giving a fail rate with continuous use of 9.5%.

Here we present a case of a young 26-year old lady with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) on rituximab who developed COVID-19 infection while on active GPA treatment. Her COVID-19 infection confirmed on PCR serology, has been protracted but non-fulminant. She did not require mechanical respiratory support. At the same time her GPA remained active and worsened requiring further immunosuppression after she developed mild pulmonary haemorrhage. She is currently still receiving vasculitis treatment. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old lady with a background history of obstructive sleep apnoea and fibromyalgia was diagnosed with ENT-limited GPA in 2017. She was initially treated with azathioprine then methotrexate, and later switched to Rituximab in 2018 after she developed organ-threatening manifestations with bilateral hearing loss. She was stable on periodic infusions of rituximab at 6 to 9-monthly intervals and did not develop other organ-threatening features. She had been given one dose of rituximab for a flare of her GPA. In between rituximab doses, she was admitted with acute COVID-19 infection with related pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, fluids, and oxygen. Shortly after discharge, she was readmitted with worsening symptoms of non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonia which was evident on chest x-ray and levofloxacin treatment was initiated. Her condition improved and she was discharged. No mechanical respiratory support was required. She had her 2(nd) dose of rituximab after it had been delayed by about 2 weeks. She had been afebrile after the acute COVID-19 infection and her persistent positive results were explained as related viral shedding over a period of 8 weeks. One week later, she represented to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath, and her blood results showed a remarkable rise in inflammatory markers, including a CRP of 242. She was treated for non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonitis with worsening chest x-ray features. After hospital discharge, her GPA continued to flare with persistent epistaxis with nasal crusting. She also had worsening inflammatory arthritis with purpuric rash on her legs. An ENT review confirmed nasal septum perforation, but no renal involvement was found. Additional cyclophosphamide was commenced via the day-case unit. Her SARS-CoV-2 serology was negative prior to commencing cyclophosphamide. She is now SARS-CoV-2 positive after two doses of cyclophosphamide, but she is afebrile and stable. CASE REPORT C DISCUSSION: COVID-19 infection carries a high mortality rate in patients with multiple co-morbidities, but recent literature suggests that patients on immunosuppressants may not actually have fulminant COVID-19 disease. This case illustrates the challenges of treating active vasculitis in the context of ongoing COVID-19 infection. Her vasculitis remained active requiring escalation of immunosuppression with caution, while she was concomitantly fighting SARS-CoV-2 and superadded bacterial infection. A similar case has been published by Guilpain et al of a 52-year-old woman with PR3-ANCA vasculitis on maintenance therapy with rituximab and low-dose prednisone who developed COVID-19 infection. They reported milder evolution of COVID-19 infection in comparison with previous reports. It is now well known that some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine and tofacitinib could suppress the cytokine profile seen in severe COVID-19 infection. In addition, several case reports have even reported possible protective effect of immunosuppressants against severe complications of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatological and non-rheumatological conditions. Another complexity in this case was monitoring the disease progression, since both COVID-19 and GPA can have similar findings on chest CT scan of ground glass opacity. In order to better understand the role of immunosuppressants in rheumatological patients with COVID-19 infection, more data is required, currently European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) is collecting data to monitor and report outcomes of COVID-19 in adult and paediatric population, this will provide invaluable insight for Rheumatologists.

It has also stressed the importance of working in a multidisciplinary team when managing such complex patients. .

Due to their ubiquitous expression within tissues and their large functional repertoire, HSPGs are involved in many physiopathological processes; thus, they have emerged as valuable targets for the therapy of many human diseases. Among their functions, HSPGs assist many viruses in invading host cells at various steps of their life cycle. Viruses utilize HSPGs for the attachment to the host cell, internalization, intracellular trafficking, egress, and spread. Recently, HSPG involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been established. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying HSPG/SARS-CoV-2 interaction and downstream effects, and we provide an overview of the HSPG-based therapeutic strategies that could be used to combat such a fearsome virus.","output":"Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans in Viral Infection and Treatment: A Special Focus on SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the possible neuroinvasion pathways of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: We present data regarding the family of Coronaviruses (CoVs) and the central nervous system (CNS), and describe parallels between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the family, which have been investigated in more depth and combine these findings with the recent advancements regarding SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 like other CoVs is neuroinvasive, neurotropic and neurovirulent. Two main pathways of CNS penetration seem to be the strongest candidates, the hematogenous and the neuronal. he olfactory route in particular appears to play a significant role in neuroinvasion of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, as well. However, existing data suggest that other routes, involving the nasal epithelium in general, lymphatic tissue and the CSF may also play roles in SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the CNS.","output":"Unraveling the Possible Routes of SARS-COV-2 Invasion into the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes methods used to isolate, identify, and partially characterize lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which exhibit inhibitory activity against Listeria monocytogenes from foods. Vegetal (plant based) sources are rich in naturally occurring LAB and therefore provide an easily accessible source of strains with potential antimicrobial activity for use in food-processing applications. From our previous work, the majority of LAB with inhibitory activity against L. monocytogenes were identified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) Lactococcus lactis. Although these bacteria are most commonly known for their role in industrial dairy fermentations, they are believed to have originally derived from natural plant-based habitats. These isolates with anti-Listeria activity were all found to carry the genes involved in the production of nisin, which is an approved food-grade preservative (E234). These isolates may find various applications for in situ production of nisin allowing control of L. monocytogenes in various fermented and non-fermented foods and other environments.","output":"Isolation and Evaluation of Anti-Listeria Lactococcus lactis from Vegetal Sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pooled testing is widely used for screening for viral or bacterial infections with low prevalence when individual testing is not cost-efficient. Pooled testing with qualitative assays that give binary results has been well-studied. However, characteristics of pooling with quantitative assays were mostly demonstrated using simulations or empirical studies. We investigate properties of three pooling strategies with quantitative assays: traditional two-stage mini-pooling (MP) (Dorfman, 1943), mini-pooling with deconvolution algorithm (MPA) (May et al., 2010), and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA) (Liu et al., 2017). MPA and mMPA test individuals in a sequence after a positive pool and implement a deconvolution algorithm to determine when testing can cease to ascertain all individual statuses. mMPA uses information from other available markers to determine an optimal order for individual testings. We derive and compare the general statistical properties of the three pooling methods. We show that with a proper pool size, MP, MPA, and mMPA can be more cost-efficient than individual testing, and mMPA is superior to MPA and MP. For diagnostic accuracy, mMPA and MPA have higher specificity and positive predictive value but lower sensitivity and negative predictive value than MP and individual testing. Included in this paper are applications to various simulations and an application for HIV treatment monitoring.","output":"Informed Pooled Testing with Quantitative Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the face of healthcare delivery This article discusses the concept of medical sacrifice and personal risk, and how healthcare workers can apply these concepts when working outside their comfort zones, while remaining within the limits of their clinical competence Guidance from the General Medical Council and the medical defence organisations is reviewed and considered in its practical application We explore how a medical student, now a 'fast tracked' junior doctor, and a senior consultant, with pre-existing health issues, can feel confident working as part of the NHS response to COVID-19","output":"Sacrifice and risk in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 5 December 2002 the Australian Senate passed the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, which regulates stem cell research.

STEM Teaching Fellows met once a week to plan the following week's STEM class to be delivered via Zoom to twelve first grade students at the Boys and Girls Club. During the planning meeting the weekly topic was discussed and collectively it was decided which specific activities would be performed the following week with the students. In week one, the topic was the heart. The STEM Fellow used PowerPoint slides to illustrate the anatomy of the heart while explaining the physiology of the heart. Then the students were guided through the creation of a simple heart pump. The STEM Director was on site with the students to assist them when needed. To complete the activity, the 3 jars were filled halfway with water and a few drops of red dye to represent blood. A red balloon was placed around the rim of the center jar (representing the heart). Two holes were made in the balloon of the center jar and straws that were immersed in the blood of the outer jars were placed in the wholes. Pushing on the balloon of the center jar made the heart pump the ?blood? from one jar to another in sequence thus mimicking heart function. After the activity there was an opportunity for the students to ask questions and the STEM Fellow provided answers. Homework was then assigned to students related to the topic to share with others what they learned. The teaching portion of the topic went well as students were engaged and asked questions. The heart model activity took about 10 minutes longer than expected. Students seemed to have difficulty combining the straws together. Students also behaved well and followed the COVID guidelines adequately. A few things that can be changed for next time would be to have the straws ready for students rather than have them put them together. They enjoyed this activity and had fun with it as well. The student participation level went beyond expectations for the first-grade group. They could read and understand the PowerPoint presented and were filled with questions. They also answered questions when asked such as, ?What is the heart?? and ?Why do we need a heart?? The Fellows planning group meetings before each class were beneficial to practice the activities before officially teaching the topic, which made it easier when the class met. As a group, the STEM Fellows themselves learned something new and enjoyed the chosen topic.

COVID-19 positive individuals may even be asymptomatic making the diagnosis difficult, but amongst the infected subjects, the asymptomatic ones need not be entirely free of symptoms caused by the virus. They might not show any observable symptoms like the symptomatic subjects, but they may differ from uninfected ones in the way they cough. These differences in the coughing sounds are minute and indiscernible to the human ear, however, these can be captured using machine learning-based statistical models. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to analyze the acoustic dataset provided in Track 1 of the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge containing cough sound recordings belonging to both COVID-19 positive and negative examples. To perform the classification on the sound recordings as belonging to a COVID-19 positive or negative examples, we propose a ConvNet model. Our model achieved an AUC score percentage of 72.23 on the blind test set provided by the same for an unbiased evaluation of the models. The ConvNet model incorporated with Data Augmentation further increased the AUC-ROC percentage from 72.23 to 87.07.

About 20% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 require renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, data on the prediction of acute kidney injury requiring RRT is lacking. Novel biomarkers, such as mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) might be likely candidates for risk assessment due to its involvement during the initial phase of multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate MR-proADM for prediction of RRT in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS We analysed data of all consecutive patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19, requiring ICU admission at one of 12 intensive care units at a tertiary care university hospital in Germany between March and September 2020. Clinical characteristics including details on acute kidney injury, RRT, and survival were assessed. MR-proADM was measured as part of routine lab monitoring on admission to ICU. RESULTS 64 patients were included in the study. The median age was 62.5 (54 - 73) years; 49 patients (77%) were male. 47 (73%) patients were mechanically ventilated and 50 (78%) needed vasopressor therapy. 25 (39%) patients suffered from severe ARDS; veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established in 10 patients. 29 (45%) patients required RRT during the ICU-stay; Median time from ICU admission to start of RRT was 2 (1 - 9) days. MR-proADM on ICU admission was significantly higher in patients requiring RRT (2.491 vs. 1.230 nmol/l; p = 0.002) and showed the highest correlation with SOFA renal subscore on day 1. ROC curve analysis showed that MR-proADM predicts RRT with an AUC of 0.685 (95% CI: 0.543 - 0.828; p = 0.019). In multivariable logistic regression MR-proADM was an independent predictor (OR: 3.813, 95% CI 1.110 - 13.102, p < 0.05) for the requirement of RRT. CONCLUSION Acute kidney injury requiring RRT is a frequent finding in critically ill patients with COVID-19. MR-proADM on admission to ICU was able to predict later requirement for RRT, which may be of interest for early risk stratification and patient management.","output":"MR-proAdrenomedullin as predictor of renal replacement therapy in a cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A massive home-quarantine took place in China due to the novel coronavirus in the end of 2019. The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences. It can be concluded that the nature of the impact of mandatory quarantine in China among small business owners and the self-employed is complex and depends on a variety of personal and situational factors.","output":"Psychological impact of mandatory COVID-19 quarantine on small business owners and self-employed in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A One Health approach requires integrative research to elucidate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment and the risks it poses to human health. Research on this topic involves experts from diverse backgrounds and professions. Shortcomings exist in terms of consistent, complete, and transparent reporting in many environmental studies. Standardized reporting will improve the quality of scientific papers, enable meta-analyses and enhance the communication among different experts. In this study, we aimed to generate a consensus of reporting standards for AMR research in wastewater and related aquatic environments. METHODS: Based on a risk of bias assessment of the literature in a systematic review, we proposed a set of study quality indicators. We then used a multistep modified Delphi consensus to develop the EMBRACE-WATERS statement (rEporting antiMicroBial ResistAnCE in WATERS), a checklist of recommendations for reporting in studies of AMR in wastewater and related aquatic environments. FINDINGS: Consensus was achieved among a multidisciplinary panel of twenty-one experts in three steps. The developed EMBRACE-WATERS statement incorporates 21 items. Each item contains essential elements of high-quality reporting and is followed by an explanation of their rationale and a reporting-example. The EMBRACE-WATERS statement is primarily intended to be used by investigators to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting of their studies. It can also guide peer-reviewers and editors in evaluation of manuscripts on AMR in the aquatic environment. This statement is not intended to be used to guide investigators on the methodology of their research. INTERPRETATION: We are hopeful that this statement will improve the reporting quality of future studies of AMR in wastewater and related aquatic environments. Its uptake would generate a common language to be used among researchers from different disciplines, thus advancing the One Health approach towards understanding AMR spread across aquatic environments.

The challenge for clinical laboratories has been finding a high throughput, cost-efficient, and accurate testing method in the context of extraction reagents shortage on a global scale. To answer this need, we studied SARS-CoV-2 detection in oro-nasopharyngeal (ONP) swabs stored in Universal Transport Media (UTM) or in RNase-free water by rRT-PCR with Seegene Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV assay without RNA extraction. RESULTS: Optimal results were obtained when swabs stored in UTM were diluted 1/5 and 1/2 in RNase-free water. Thermal lysis before rRT-PCR testing slightly improved detection rate. In addition, proteinase K (PK) treatment allowed for a significant reduction of invalid results and increased sensitivity for detection of low viral load specimens. In a panel of positive samples with all 3 viral genes amplified and N gene Cycle threshold values (Ct values) from 15 to 40, our detection rate was 98.9% with PK and 94.4% without. In a challenging panel of low positive samples with only the N gene being detectable at Ct values > 30, detection rate was increased from 53.3 to 76.7% with the addition of PK, and invalid rate fell off from 18.3 to 0%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method reliably detects specimens with Ct values up to 35, whereas false negative samples become frequent above this range. Finally, we show that swabs should be stored at - 70 C rather than 4 C when testing cannot be performed within 72 h of collection.

METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study was performed on nonhospitalized adult patients (18 years) with COVID-19. Pharmacotherapy service was responsible for patients' assessment for up to 1 month. Demographic characteristics, the onset of symptoms, severity, duration, laboratory data, and hospitalization rate were evaluated by a pharmacist-based monitoring program. RESULTS: From 323 patients who had been referred to the emergency department, 105 individuals were recruited between April 26 and August 2, 2020. Most of the patients were female (66.7%) with a mean age of 39.39 years (SD:  15.82). The mean time of the symptom onset was 5.6 days (SD: 1.79). The majority of patients suffered from fatigue (78.1%), sore throat (67.6%), cough (60%), and myalgia (55.2%). C-reactive protein, white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and hemoglobin levels were recovered significantly during the first two weeks (P < 0.001).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) results, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Among 104 workers tested, 21 (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six per cent positive cases were asymptomatic. Employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 5.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 24.8) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after adjustments. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (ie, GAD-7 score >4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.99) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively.

Orthopoxviruses remain a threat on multiple fronts, especially as emerging zoonoses. In response, we developed a DNA vaccine, termed 4pox, that protected nonhuman primates against monkeypox virus (MPXV)-induced severe disease. Here, we examined the protective efficacy of the 4pox DNA vaccine delivered by intramuscular (i.m.) electroporation (EP) in rabbits challenged with aerosolized rabbitpox virus (RPXV), a model that recapitulates the respiratory route of exposure and low dose associated with natural smallpox exposure in humans. We found that 4pox-vaccinated rabbits developed immunogen-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, and did not develop any clinical disease, indicating protection against aerosolized RPXV. In contrast, unvaccinated animals developed significant signs of disease, including lesions, and were euthanized. These findings demonstrate that an unformulated, nonadjuvanted DNA vaccine delivered i.m. can protect against an aerosol exposure. IMPORTANCE The eradication of smallpox and subsequent cessation of vaccination have left a majority of the population susceptible to variola virus or other emerging poxviruses. This is exemplified by human monkeypox, as evidenced by the increase in reported endemic and imported cases over the past decades. Therefore, a malleable vaccine technology that can be mass produced and does not require complex conditions for distribution and storage is sought. Herein, we show that a DNA vaccine, in the absence of a specialized formulation or adjuvant, can protect against a lethal aerosol insult of rabbitpox virus.","output":"A Nucleic Acid-Based Orthopoxvirus Vaccine Targeting the Vaccinia Virus L1, A27, B5, and A33 Proteins Protects Rabbits against Lethal Rabbitpox Virus Aerosol Challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study measured national resilience (NR) in three different time frames during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Israel (N = 804).

In order to adequately prepare these care advisors, contemporary needs and requirements must be determined. The aim of the study was to determine the different needs of persons in need of long-term care and their relatives. METHOD: Care advisors were interviewed via an online survey tool using a standardized questionnaire. A 5-point Likert scale was used to determine the needs regarding information and advice on 16 specific topics. In general, overall needs regarding information and advice of care recipients and relatives were recorded using a 10-point scale (1 low and 10 high). Using classification and regression trees (CRT) and random forest, the correlation between the individual main topics and the general need for advice was analyzed. RESULTS: The participating care advisors (n = 276) rated the general demand for information of people in need of care and their relatives with a mean of 7.8 and 9.2, respectively. For those in need of care, the strongest association of general information needs was the topic of housing advice For the relatives, the topic social law aspects and benefits was the most relevant association. CONCLUSION: The general demand for information was rated very high. Since differences became obvious between those in need of care and their relatives, it is necessary to adjust care advice for these two groups.","output":"Untersttzungsbedarfe pflegeempfangender Menschen: Erhebung allgemeiner und spezieller Informations?, Hilfe- und Untersttzungsbedarfe pflegeempfangender Menschen und ihrer Angeh?rigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Satisfactory outcome was observed in one mild case and one severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia after the use of the online/offline multidisciplinary quarantine observation form, online monitoring, and classified diagnosis and treatment, as well as strict compliance with quarantine measures.

Due to the heterogeneity of virus spread, there are spatial variations in the demand for medical resources such as personal protective equipment (PPE), testing kits, and vaccines. The availability of such medical resources is critical to effective epidemic control. Although these resources can be readily transported to designated areas for fighting an epidemic, the demand is increasing and varying in space that places significant stress on the supply and allocation of medical resources. However, little has been done on the tessellation of infection distributions for resource management. In this letter, we develop new tessellation algorithms for decision support in epidemic resource allocation and management. The objective is to estimate resource locations and coverage based on the spatial analysis of heterogeneous infection distribution. First, spatial tessellation centroids are initialized through either greedy or cluster-centric approaches. Next, the locations of tessellation centroids are calibrated through a gradient learning algorithm. Lastly, the spread tessellation is computed to provide an estimation of resource coverages under the heterogeneous infection distribution. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated using a COVID-19 case study of infection data in Pennsylvania. Experimental results show the proposed methodology effectively tessellates the spread of infectious diseases.

To complement that, laser polishing (LP) is one of the advanced manufacturing surface finishing techniques that has been recently developed and successfully employed for improving surface quality without deteriorating the overall structural form through surface smoothing by melting and redistributing a thin layer of molten material. This paper proposes a statistical digital twin of the LP process and demonstrates the applicability of amplitude distribution statistical characteristics in the experimental analysis of surface topography formation during LP process. Initially, the thermodynamic transformation of the initial surface topography is considered by means of technical cybernetics and machine learning approaches to describe two of the most critical LP process components, namely: thermodynamic melting and solidification of both solid material and surface topography. To exemplify the effective application of statistical amplitude distribution characteristics, LP experiments were conducted with two different laser powers (25 W and 100 W) on flat and ground initial surfaces and resulting surface topographies were measured. Several amplitude distribution characteristics, such as roughness average value, averaged transverse profile as a W-shape, averaged transverse roughness profile, and probability distribution function were calculated. After that, actual molten material area, volume redistribution and final surface quality were comparatively analyzed. It was shown that the proportion between two components of the LP thermodynamic transformation and surface topography is critically dependent on laser power. As such, during low-power conditions (< 25 W), surface quality is predominantly determined by the thermodynamic transformation of initial surface topography and therefore only this component can be used for statistically reliable LP process modelling and digital identification. In summary, amplitude distribution characteristics have several advantages in building a comprehensive understanding of the molten material redistributing along and across LP line.","output":"Preliminary experimental analysis of the surface topography formation during laser polishing H13 tooling steel using statistical characteristics of the surface amplitude distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study was conducted to evaluate Averrhoa bilimbi fruits flavonoids extraction and quantification analysis through RP-HPLC and its comparison study on total flavonoids concentration versus antimicrobial activity analysis based on minimum inhibitory concentrations.

Participants read a case in which the gender of the parent responsible for maltreatment (mother or father) and race/ethnicity of the family (white, Black, or Latinx) varied. RESULTS: A SEM model (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .05) with free parameters for trainees and current staff was estimated. No significant association between stereotypes and race/ethnicity and gender appeared.

METHODS: A total of 94 patients with COVID\\\\19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID\\\\19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 49, severe 35, and critical 10), and 40 healthy cases were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The diagnostic and prognostic value of indices in peripheral blood cell count and general biochemical analysis was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with healthy cases, the value differences in peripheral blood analysis in patients with COVID\\\\19 were statistically significant (p < 0.01), the differences in LYM, neutrophil count (Neu), platelet count (PLT), and white blood cell count (WBC) were statistically significant among different severity of COVID\\\\19 (p < 0.05).

We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CARDS, and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management. Design: We adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of ARDS, to (a) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between CARDS and conventional ARDS, and (b) assess the impact of different PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume settings. Setting: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network. Subjects: The simulator was calibrated to represent CARDS patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Measurements and Main Results: An ARDS model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on Type 1 CARDS patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi, produced levels of V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from Type 1 CARDS patients, while preserving close to normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to PEEP increments between 5 and 15 cmH2O were observed for this Type 1 CARDS model across a range of measures: increasing PEEP resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, while Mechanical Power, Driving Pressure and Plateau Pressure all increased. FiO2 settings based on ARDSnet protocols at different PEEP levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 ml/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator induced lung injury in the Type 1 CARDS model to those seen in a conventional ARDS model. Conclusions: Our model suggests that use of standard PEEP/ FiO2 tables, higher PEEP strategies, and higher tidal volumes, may all be potentially deleterious in Type 1 CARDS patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","output":"In-silico modeling of COVID-19 ARDS: pathophysiological insights and potential management implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac arrhythmia is a known manifestation of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Those benefits have been classified as transparency, centralization, and access to new markets for the organizations considering their consequences, especially when using digital technology. When processes are taking place online, there are fair chances of hiding knowledge about certain products or procedures to gain particular benefits. Hence, this study has considered the moderating role of product knowledge hiding while interacting online. This study is a quantitative post-positivist cross-sectional study that has followed a survey technique for data collection. The population used in this study is the managerial staff of the telecom sector in the mainland in China. The sample size used in this study is 358. The software used in this study is Smart-PLS 3.3. The technique used in this study for data analysis is structural equation modeling with measurement modeling. The findings of this study show that digital technology has led to many benefits for organizations like centralization, access to the new markets, and transparency, which have been made possible remotely only because of the use of digital technology in business operations. However, the moderating role of product knowledge hiding has been found significant only for transparency.

In this paper, we used network science to examine the topological resilience of national energy networks with two case studies of Australian gas and electricity networks. To measure the fragility and resilience of these energy networks, we assessed various topological features and theories of percolation. We found that both networks follow the degree distribution of power-law and the characteristics of a scale-free network. Then, using these models, we conducted node and edge removal experiments. The analysis identified the most critical nodes that can trigger cascading failure within the network upon a fault.

The cytotoxicity of samples was determined using peritoneal macrophages though the Alamar Blue assay. The immunomodulatory activity of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata on activated macrophages was determined by measurement of nitrite and cytokine production. The immunosuppressive effects of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was evaluated on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. The effects of the extract on cell cycle progression and cell death on lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Lastly, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was tested in vivo in toxicological tests and in models of peritonitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The ethanolic extract from P. angulata decreased nitrite, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and TNF- production by activated macrophages without affecting the cell viability. In addition, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata inhibited lymphoproliferation and the secretion of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and IFN-, and increased interleukin-4 secretion by activated splenocytes. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with the ethanolic extract from P. angulata induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, mice treated with the extract from P. angulata at 100 or 200 mg/kg did not show signs of toxicity or alterations in serum components.

Material: and Methods : A transversal and multicentric study of questionnaires was designed. Demographic, socio-familiar and laboral information was collected, as well as emotional self perception information, psychosomatic symptoms, tobacco consumption and psychotropic treatment. Participants fulfilled the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: 440 questionnaires were registered. Globally, 42.2% of the participants expressed moderate-intense anxiety symptomatology according to the Anxiety-State scale and 26.8% in the Anxiety-Trait scale. Domiciliary isolation was associated with a higher score in both scales. Changes in the cohabitants working situation was associated with a higher score in the Anxiety-State scale. With respect to the psychological impact perceived by participants during pandemic situation, 41.1% classified it as mild, 50% as moderate, and 8.9% as severe. Up to 71.8% of the participants suffered psychosomatic symptoms. A linear association was found between suffering from multiple psychosomatic symptoms and higher scores in both scales.

It is unclear how these agents affect patients with cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N = 820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19 as well as level of respiratory support during corticosteroid administration. Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes prior to use of supplemental oxygen; no statistically significant difference was observed in sicker cohorts. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19.

Previous research has documented that anxious and avoidant attachment orientations have deleterious effects on the trauma recovery process leaving these survivors vulnerable to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, avoidant attachment may be more complicated. Prior work has also found those high in avoidant attachment but also low in anxious attachment (i.e., dismissing) may not experience such vulnerabilities. Further, avoidant attachment individuals often report higher self-efficacy than their anxiously attached counterparts. The present study examined trauma coping self-efficacy (CSE-T) as a previously unexamined mechanism of action between adult attachment and PTSD symptoms. Structural equation modeling results showed that anxious attachment was associated with lower CSE-T and greater PTSD symptoms six weeks later. Further, a significant indirect effect of anxious attachment on PTSD symptoms through CSE-T was found. Contrary to hypotheses, avoidant attachment also exhibited an indirect effect on PTSD symptoms through CSE-T, such that avoidant attachment was associated with lower CSE-T, which in turn, was associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Also contrary to hypotheses, the interaction between anxious and avoidant attachment was not significantly associated with either CSE-T or PTSD symptoms. Results suggest that both anxious and avoidant attachment orientations contribute to poor self-regulation following trauma, as they undermine perceptions of trauma coping self-efficacy.","output":"Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy Mediates Associations Between Adult Attachment and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel restrictions have been in effect since March 2020 in Canada. As a result, some patients requiring international travel for medical care have experienced delays. Therefore, innovative techniques were required to provide care that would not routinely be performed in Canada, as in the case of Orbera? gastric balloon retrieval. AIMS: To describe an approach to gastric balloon retrieval amidst COVID-19 related travel restrictions METHODS: Case review of three cases of gastric balloon retrieval was performed RESULTS: 1: A 41-year-old (yo) woman had an Orbera? gastric balloon placement in Washington state in September 2019. She lost 42lbs. Retrieval was scheduled for March 2020, but was delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. In May 2020, she developed symptoms of balloon dysfunction. The patient was referred to a Canadian tertiary care centre. Gastroscopy was performed under conscious sedation. The Orbera? balloon was in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G EUS FNA needle; 600cc of blue tinted liquid was aspirated. The emptied balloon was retrieved successfully using rat tooth forceps. 2: A 35-yo woman had an Orbera? gastric balloon placed in October 2019 in Toronto at a private health facility. She lost 20lbs. Retrieval of the balloon was scheduled for March 2020, but due to COVID-19 restrictions, it was not possible at the original facility. She did not have symptoms related to the balloon. Gastroscopy was performed under general anesthesia (GA) on October 8, 2020. The balloon was intact in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G Cook Echotip Needle and vacuum suction applied; 400cc of blue tinted fluid was removed. Alligator forceps were used to create holes in the underside of the balloon, allowing excess fluid to be expelled as the balloon was pulled up against the GEJ. Once the balloon was deflated, it was removed successfully through the mouth. 3: A 38-yo man had an Orbera? gastric balloon placed in his native Columbia in March 2020. He did not achieve weight loss. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, he was unable to return for planned removal. He did not have symptoms related to the balloon. Gastroscopy was performed under GA on October 8, 2020. The balloon was intact in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G Cook Echotip Needle and vacuum suction applied; 600cc of blue tinted fluid was removed. Alligator forceps were used in retroflexion to tear the underside of the flattened balloon to ensure all liquid and air had escaped from the balloon. Once the balloon was deflated, it was removed successfully through the mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Although Orbera? gastric balloon retrieval is not routinely performed in Canada, we demonstrate that gastroscopy with balloon puncture and forceps-retrieval is a safe option.

Direct comparisons between NM and conventional materials (CM) in terms of local morbidity and need for prosthesis removal are lacking. METHODS Between January 2005 and July 2013, 109 procedures were performed to remove chest wall tumors in 86 patients. Of these, 32 underwent complex chest wall reconstructions owing to either recurrence, defect extension (greater than 3 ribs or >100 cm2) or local conditions (ie, previous irradiation or infection). New materials and CM (ie, polytetrafluoroethylene and methyl methacrylate) were used in 17 (53%) and 15 (47%) patients, respectively. Of the 32 patients included in the high complexity group, 23 patients did not exhibit any postoperative complications (72%). However, 9 patients (28%) underwent both a first and a second reoperation after a median interval of 4 months from the first procedure (range, 7 days to 60 months). Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was instituted in all patients as a means to control sepsis and facilitate space obliteration with healthy tissue. RESULTS In 7 patients the reason for reintervention was local wound complications. In 4 of 7 patients, the prosthesis had to be removed (3 CM and 1 NM, 4.6% of the whole series; 12.5% in the high complexity group, 5.9% for NM and 20% for CM). The median time to complete chest wall healing after VAC in patients with local sepsis was 14 months (range, 5 to 60 months). All patients are currently alive and well except for 1 who died 11 months after complete chest wall healing as a result of dissemination of metastatic chondrosarcoma. At univariate analysis, predictors of overall and grade 2 or less morbidity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 were first (p=0.038) and second (p=0.015) redo operations. Conversely, patients with a body mass index of less than 25 kg/m2 (p=0.049) undergoing one (p=0.032) or two reconstructions (p=0.00047) with combined materials (p=0.00029) were more likely to experience local wound complications and require VAC. On multiple regression analysis, redo operations (first, p=0.032; second, p=0.00047) and the use of combined (synthetic and biologic) materials (p=0.0029) were confirmed to be related to an increased incidence of wound complications. CONCLUSIONS Multiple redo operations after complex chest wall reconstruction performed with a combination of NM and CM may be associated with an increased incidence of local wound complications. Nevertheless, in these cases, the use of NM and VAC yielded a low rate (5.8% versus 20% with CM) of prosthesis removal while achieving complete wound healing.","output":"Postoperative local morbidity and the use of vacuum-assisted closure after complex chest wall reconstructions with new and conventional materials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediates mucosal responses to food antigens and the intestinal microbiome and has a known role in susceptibility to mucosal pathogens, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IgA nephropathy.

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of T1S and C2S deformity severity on HRQoL metrics and DJF development in patients with CD who underwent a cervical fusion procedure. METHODS: All operative CD patients with upper instrumented vertebra above C7 and preoperative (baseline) and up to 2-year postoperative radiographic and HRQoL data were included. CD was defined as meeting at least one of the following radiographic parameters: C2-7 lordosis < -15, TS1-cervical lordosis mismatch > 35, segmental cervical kyphosis > 15 across any 3 vertebrae between C2 and T1, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis > 4 cm, McGregor's slope > 20, or chin-brow vertical angle > 25. Spearman's rank-order correlation and linear regression analysis assessed the impact of T1S and C2S on HRQoL metrics (Neck Disability Index [NDI], modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] scale, EuroQOL 5-Dimension Questionnaire [EQ-5D] visual analog scale [VAS] score, and numeric rating scale [NRS]-neck) and complications (DJK, DJF, reoperation). Logistic regression and a conditional inference tree (CIT) were used to determine radiographic thresholds for achieving optimal clinical outcome, defined as meeting good clinical outcome criteria ( 2 of the following: NDI < 20 or meeting minimal clinically important difference, mild myelopathy [mJOA score  14], and NRS-neck  5 or improved by  2 points), not undergoing reoperation, or developing DJF or mechanical complication by 2 years. RESULTS: One hundred five patients with CD met inclusion criteria. By surgical approach, 14.7% underwent an anterior-only approach, 46.1% a posterior-only approach, and 39.2% combined anterior and posterior approaches. The mean baseline radiographic parameters were T1S 28.3  14.5 and C2S 25.9  17.5. Significant associations were found between 3-month C2S and mJOA score (r = -0.248, p = 0.034), NDI (r = 0.399, p = 0.001), EQ-5D VAS (r = -0.532, p < 0.001), NRS-neck (r = 0.239, p = 0.040), and NRS-back (r = 0.264, p = 0.021), while significant correlation was also found between 3-month T1S and mJOA score (r = -0.314, p = 0.026), NDI (r = 0.445, p = 0.001), EQ-5D VAS (r = -0.347, p = 0.018), and NRS-neck (r = 0.269, p = 0.049). A significant correlation was also found between development of DJF and 3-month C2S (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.1, p = 0.015) as well as for T1S (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.023). Logistic regression with CIT identified thresholds for optimal outcome by 2 years: optimal 3-month T1S < 26 (OR 5.6) and C2S < 10 (OR 10.4), severe 3-month T1S < 45.5 (OR 0.2) and C2S < 38.0 (no patient above this threshold achieved optimal outcome; all p < 0.05). Patients below both optimal thresholds achieved rates of 0% for DJK and DJF, and 100% met optimal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of CD, defined by T1S and C2S at baseline and especially at 3 months, can be predictive of postoperative functional improvement and occurrence of worrisome complications in patients with CD, necessitating the use of thresholds in surgical planning to achieve optimal outcomes.","output":"Do the newly proposed realignment targets for C2 and T1 slope bridge the gap between radiographic and clinical success in corrective surgery for adult cervical deformity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to determine the financial performance of Perumda BPR Bank Cirebon before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to compare the effects of minimal-contact robotic rehabilitation (MRR) and full-contact conventional rehabilitation (FCR) on static and dynamic balance, trunk stability, ADLs, spasticity, and cognition changes in patients with hemiparetic stroke. A total of 64 patients with hemiparetic stroke (mean age = 66.38  13.17; 27 women) underwent either MRR or FCR three times/week for 6 weeks. Clinical outcome measurements included the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the FuglMeyer Assessment (FMA), and the modified Barthel Index (MBI) scores. A 2  2 repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, and an independent t-test was used to determine statistical differences in the physiotherapists work efficiency and COVID-19 transmission risk. The ANOVA showed that MRR had effects superior to those of FCR on the TIS, the BBS, the FMA, and the MBI (p < 0.05), but not on the MAS (p = 0.230). MRR showed a greater decrease on the physiotherapists work efficiency and COVID-19 transmission risk (p < 0.05). Our results provide clinical evidence that robot-assisted locomotor training helps maximize the recovery of sensorimotor function, abnormal synergy, balance, ADLs, and trunk stability, and facilitates a safer environment and less labor demand than conventional stroke rehabilitation.","output":"Minimal Contact Robotic Stroke Rehabilitation on Risk of COVID-19, Work Efficiency and Sensorimotor Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the deadly virus (novel coronavirus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) that emerged in December 2019, remained a controversial subject of intense speculations regarding its origin, became a worldwide health problem resulting in serious coronavirus disease of 2019 (acronym COVID-19). The concern regarding this new viral strain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (acronym SARS-CoV-2) and diseases it causes (COVID-19) is well deserved at all levels. The incidence of COVID-19 infection and infectious patients are increasing at a high rate.

However, some studies show that this is not always the case. A demand shock theory can explain the decrease in firms capital expenditures and net debt issuance during crisis period, but there should be no causal link between the two. This is because firms naturally do not invest during crisis period because of a decrease in investment wealth during crisis period. This paper aims to examine these theories with respect to the Covid-19 crisis in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: The change in firms capital expenditure and net debt issuance is analyzed using a non-parametric difference-in-difference and matching estimator across four firm-dimensions to see whether the implications of the supply shock theory apply to the current crisis or if that firms naturally do not invest during the crisis. In addition, this paper provides the result of panel regression to confirm the causal link between firms investment funds and capital expenditure, with an addition of consumer confidence index to accommodate the implications of the demand shock theory. Findings: The results of this paper show that the implications of the supply shock theory cannot explain the economic fluctuation during the Covid-19 crisis. Rather, the results suggest that firms naturally do not want to invest during the crisis and that the demand shock can better explain the economic fluctuation during the Covid-19 crisis. This is confirmed by the result of panel regression which shows that only consumer confidence index has a significant positive relationship with firms capital expenditure. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the theory of impaired access to capital with respect to the Covid-19 crisis in Indonesia. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Demand or supply shock during the COVID-19 crisis: empirical evidence from public firms in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Chagas disease, the initial responses of phagocyte-mediated innate immunity are strongly associated with the control of Trypanosoma cruzi and are mediated by various signaling pathways, including the inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) pathway. The clinical and laboratory manifestations of Chagas disease depend on the parasiteChost relationship, i.e., the responsive capacity of the host immune system and the immunogenicity of the parasite. Here, we evaluated effect sizes in clinical and laboratory parameters mediated by acute infection with different concentrations of T. cruzi inoculum in mice immunosuppressed via iNOS pathway inactivation. Infection was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type and iNOS(-/-) mice with the Y strain of T. cruzi at three inoculum concentrations (3  10(2), 3  10(3), and 3  10(4)). Parasitemia and mortality in both mouse strains were monitored. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify amastigotes in cardiac tissues and cardiac musculature cells. Biochemical parameters, such as blood urea nitrogen, sodium, albumin, and globulin concentrations, among others, were measured, and cytokine concentrations were also measured. Effect sizes were determined by the eta squared formula. Compared with that in wild-type animals, mice with an absence of iNOS expression demonstrated a greater parasite load, with earlier infection and a delayed parasitemia peak. Inoculum concentration was positively related to death in the immunosuppressed subgroup. Nineteen parameters (hematological, biochemical, cytokine-related, and histopathological) in the immunocompetent subgroup and four in the immunosuppressed subgroup were associated with parasitemia. Parasitemia, biochemical parameters, and hematological parameters were found to be predictors in the knockout group. The impact of effect sizes on the markers evaluated based on T. cruzi inoculum concentration was notably high in the immunocompetent group (Cohens d = 88.50%; p <.001). These findings contribute to the understanding of physiopathogenic mechanisms underlying T. cruzi infection and also indicate the influence of the concentration of T. cruzi during infection and the immunosuppression through the iNOS pathway in clinical laboratory heterogeneity reported in acute Chagas disease.","output":"Predicting Blood Parasite Load and Influence of Expression of iNOS on the Effect Size of Clinical Laboratory Parameters in Acute Trypanosoma cruzi Infection With Different Inoculum Concentrations in C57BL/6 Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A visual colorimetric rapid screening system based on a lateral flow device for simultaneous detection and differentiation between influenza A and B nucleoprotein as a model was developed.

However, little is known about the presentation of patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care, particularly those who used 911 emergency medical services (EMS). OBJECTIVE: To describe patient characteristics and prehospital presentation of patients with COVID-19 cared for by EMS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 124 patients who required 911 EMS care for COVID-19 in King County, Washington, a large metropolitan region covering 2300 square miles with 2.2 million residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas, between February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Test results were available a median (interquartile range) of 5 (3-9) days after the EMS encounter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of clinical characteristics, symptoms, examination signs, and EMS impression and care. RESULTS: Of the 775 confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, EMS responded to 124 (16.0%), with a total of 147 unique 911 encounters. The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (13.2) years, 66 patients (53.2%) were women, 47 patients (37.9%) had 3 or more chronic health conditions, and 57 patients (46.0%) resided in a long-term care facility. Based on EMS evaluation, 43 of 147 encounters (29.3%) had no symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Based on individual examination findings, fever, tachypnea, or hypoxia were only present in a limited portion of cases, as follows: 43 of 84 encounters (51.2%), 42 of 131 (32.1%), and 60 of 112 (53.6%), respectively. Advanced care was typically not required, although in 24 encounters (16.3%), patients received care associated with aerosol-generating procedures. As of June 1, 2020, mortality among the study cohort was 52.4% (65 patients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that screening based on conventional COVID-19 symptoms or corresponding examination findings of febrile respiratory illness may not possess the necessary sensitivity for early diagnostic suspicion, at least in the prehospital emergency setting.

Methods: We conducted a survey to estimate SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seroprevalence among adult residents of capital city of Tbilisi (adult population: 859,328). Participants were recruited through respondent driven sampling during May 18-27, 2020. Blood specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using commercially available lateral flow immunoassay (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Crude seroprevalence was weighted by population characteristics (age, sex, district of Tbilisi) and further adjusted for test accuracy. Results: Among 1,068 adults recruited 963 (90.2%) were between 18 and 64 years-old, 682 (63.9%) women. 176 (16.5%) reported symptoms indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in previous three months. Nine persons tested positive for IgG: crude seroprevalence: 0.84%, (95% CI: 0.33%-1.59%), weighted seroprevalence: 0.94% (95% CI: 0.37%-1.95%), weighted and adjusted for test accuracy: 1.02% (95% CI: 0.38%-2.18%). The seroprevalence estimates translate into 7,200 to 8,800 infections among adult residents of Tbilisi, which is at least 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions: Low seroprevalence confirms that Georgia successfully contained spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of pandemic. Findings also suggest that undocumented cases due to asymptomatic or very mild disease account for majority of infections. Given that asymptomatic persons can potentially spread the virus, test and isolate approach should be further expanded to control the epidemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in Tbilisi, the capital city of country of Georgia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 34-year-old woman presented with an unrelenting headache which had been ongoing since discharge from hospital 4 days before.

METHODS: We conducted a pre-post study of CORAL (COvid Risk cALculator), a CDSS that guides frontline clinicians through a risk-stratified COVID-19 diagnostic workup, removes transmission-based precautions when workup is complete and negative, and triages complex cases to Infectious Diseases (ID) physician review. Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre- and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: Fewer PUIs underwent repeat testing after an initial negative NAAT post-CORAL than pre-CORAL (54% vs. 67%; aOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63, p<0.01). CORAL significantly reduced average time to PUI status discontinuation (adjusted difference: -7.4 [SE 0.8] hours/patient; p<0.01), total duration of PUI status (adjusted difference: -19.5 [SE 1.9] hours/patient; p<0.01), and average ID physician work-hours (adjusted difference: -57.4 [SE 2.0] hours/day; p<0.01).

Recognizing this, we trained a data-driven model using 23 features representing six key influencing factors affecting the pandemic spread: social demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties, movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure. Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage. The study aimed to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features evolved at different stages; (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varied across counties with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of COVID-19 across 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features had the highest importance in counties with higher population densities; (3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social connectedness index), had higher importance for counties with higher population densities.

Cell fusion induced by infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 was inhibited by the addition of monospecific anti-E2 antibody after virus adsorption and penetration. Adsorption of concentrated coronavirions to uninfected cells did not cause cell fusion in the presence of cycloheximide. Thus, cell fusion was induced by E2 on the plasma membrane of infected 17 Cl 1 cells but not by E2 on virions grown in these cells. Trypsin treatment of virions purified from 17 Cl 1 cells quantitatively cleaved 180K E2 to 90K E2 and activated cell-fusing activity of the virions. This proteolytic cleavage yielded two different 90K species which were separable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-hydroxyapatite chromatography.

The other, 90B, was not acylated and yielded different peptides than did 90A upon limited digestion with thermolysin or staphylococcal V8 protease.

On days 1 and 14, COVID tests were positive in 4 and 2 in the HCQ group and 4 and 0 in the observation group. No tests converted to positive. There were no deaths or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical trial without personal contact, rapidly initiated and operationalized to exclude cardiac toxicity using daily remote 6-lead EKG monitoring, is feasible. Of 407 EKGs from 42 participants, there was no evidence of cardiac toxicity.

Few studies to-date have addressed the association between clinicians' competencies and mental health in this context. This cross-sectional study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms among frontline medical staff that fought against the COVID-19 outbreak, and explore the associations between their competencies, and separate and concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: A total of 623 frontline medical staff was included in this study. Competencies, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using a self-reported short form of the Chinese clinical physicians' competency model, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between one SD increase in competency scores and the prevalence of mental health problems. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 40.93, 31.78, and 26.00%, respectively. Among the medical staff with higher total competency scores, the prevalence of depressive [odds ratios (ORs) = 0.67, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.55C0.81], anxiety (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56C0.83), and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55C0.83) was lower than among their lower-scoring counterparts. Subgroup analyses stratified by core competency scores revealed similar associations as the main analyses. CONCLUSION: The present findings highlight the association between high core competency scores and lower prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.","output":"Association Between Clinical Competencies and Mental Health Symptoms Among Frontline Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay has three autoethnographic, interconnected, temporal vignettes that narrate my lived pandemic experiences of mothering a teenage daughter, performing socially isolated housework, and teaching online classes.

As both MSPC and MBPC are chiral compounds, here, we studied the carbonic anhydrase inhibitory and anticonvulsant action of both MBPC enantiomers in comparison to those of MSPC as well as their pharmacokinetic properties. Racemic-MBPC and its enantiomers showed anticonvulsant activity in the rat maximal electroshock (MES) test with ED(50) values in the range of 19C39 mg/kg. (R)-MBPC had a 65% higher clearance than its enantiomer and, consequently, a lower plasma exposure (AUC) than (S)-MSBC and racemic-MSBC. Nevertheless, (S)-MBPC had a slightly better brain permeability than (R)-MBPC with a brain-to-plasma (AUC) ratio of 1.32 (S-enantiomer), 1.49 (racemate), and 1.27 (R-enantiomer). This may contribute to its better anticonvulsant-ED(50) value. The clearance of MBPC enantiomers was more enantioselective than the brain permeability and MES-ED(50) values, suggesting that their anticonvulsant activity might be due to multiple mechanisms of action.","output":"Synthesis and Enantioselective Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis of New CNS-Active Sulfamoylphenyl Carbamate Derivatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly recognised coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused a pandemic with huge ramifications for human interactions around the globe.

To explore pregnant womens opinions toward pretest GC models and the ideal time duration, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted for women at their first prenatal visit. A total of 114 valid respondents (93.4%) were included in the analyses. Of these, 80.7% of women preferred in-person GC, followed by classroom (9.6%), group (3.5%), and telegenetic-based GC (2.6%). Women with experience in undergoing prenatal testing significantly did not prefer in-person GC (p = 0.05). Sixty-two women (54.4%) preferred a duration of 15C29 min for pretest GC sessions, followed by 30C59 min (28.9%) and <15 min (14.9%). Womens preference of 30 min in length was significantly associated with anhedonia, singleton pregnancies, acquaintance with people with trisomy 21, and awareness of prenatal testing. Women who were unaware of the need for agreement with the partner for prenatal testing and who did not know the average life expectancy of a trisomy 21 patient significantly preferred <15 min in length over other durations. While the majority of women preferred in-person GC for <30 min, their preferences varied by their background characteristics, experiences, attitudes, and knowledge.

Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. Methods: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus-disease-2019. Results: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 102 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (85%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%). There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7 %), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them serious (64%), 48 of which proved  500 ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%). Six reports derived from automedication. Discussion and conclusion: Off-label use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable. Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection. Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.","output":"Off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and chloroquine in COVID-19: a survey of cardiac adverse drug reactions by the French Network of Pharmacovigilance Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to investigate the patient population requiring emergency surgery during the first phase of lockdown due to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and compare it to the equivalent population in the same calendar period for 2019.

While the first case was recorded in Hubei in December 2019, the extent of early community spread in Central Europe before this period is unknown. A high proportion of asymptomatic cases and undocumented infections, high transmissibility, and phylogenetic genomic diversity have engendered the controversial possibility of early international community spread of SARS-CoV-2 before its emergence in China. METHODS: To assess the early presence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland, we retrospectively performed an analysis of deaths at University Hospital Basel between October 2019 and February 2020 (n = 310), comparing the incidence of clinical causes of death with March 2020 (n = 72), the month during which the first lethal COVID-19 cases in Basel were reported. Trends of COVID-19-suggestive sequelae, such as bronchopneumonia with organization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolisms (PE) were evaluated. In cases where autopsy was performed (n = 71), analogous analyses were conducted on the cause of death and pulmonary histological findings. Eight cases with a COVID-19-suggestive clinical history and histopathology between October 2019 and February 2020, and 3 cases before October 2019, were selected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: A statistically significant rise in pulmonary causes of death was observed in March 2020 (p = 0.03), consistent with the reported emergence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland. A rise in lethal bronchopneumonia was observed between December 2019 and January 2020, which was likely seasonal. The incidence of lethal ARDS and PE was uniformly low between October 2019 and February 2020. All autopsy cases analyzed by means of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR yielded negative results.

The torque values of the four AIMDs, namely implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), pacemaker, bone conduction implant, and cochlear implant, under 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI environments were measured and compared with established international standard. RESULTS: The ICD, pacemaker, bone conduction implant, and cochlear implant had average torques of 1.405, 0.255, 9.460, and 5.490 Ncm under 1.5 T MRI and 2.950, 0.668, 14.618, and 11.484 Ncm under 3.0 T MRI, respectively. DISCUSSION: The apparatus developed in this study was verified to be feasible for measuring magnetically induced torques, with tests on four types of AIMDs under 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI environments. Although the designed structure is simple, the apparatus was shown to measure torque values of AIMDs under MRI accurately.","output":"A simple apparatus for safety assessment of magnetically induced torque on active implantable medical devices (AIMDs) under 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM We investigated the impact of vibrating acoustic airflow, the high frequency (f100 Hz) and the low frequency (f45 Hz) sound waves, on the enhancement of intrasinus drug deposition. METHODS (81m)Kr-gas ventilation study was performed in a plastinated human cast with and without the addition of vibrating acoustic airflow. Similarly, intrasinus drug deposition in a nasal replica using gentamicin as a marker was studied with and without the superposition of different modes of acoustic airflow. RESULTS Ventilation experiments demonstrate that no sinus ventilation was observed without acoustic airflow although sinus ventilation occurred whatever the modes of acoustic airflow applied. Intrasinus drug deposition experiments showed that the high frequency acoustic airflow led to 4-fold increase in gentamicin deposition into the left maxillary sinus and to 2-fold deposition increase into the right maxillary sinus. Besides, the low frequency acoustic airflow demonstrated a significant increase of 4-fold and 2-fold in the right and left maxillary sinuses, respectively. CONCLUSION We demonstrated the benefit of different modes of vibrating acoustic airflow for maxillary sinus ventilation and intrasinus drug deposition. The degree of gentamicin deposition varies as a function of frequency of the vibrating acoustic airflow and the geometry of the ostia.","output":"Impact of acoustic airflow on intrasinus drug deposition: New insights into the vibrating mode and the optimal acoustic frequency to enhance the delivery of nebulized antibiotic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare the postoperative tissue damage and longitudinal changes in functional and patient-reported outcomes after vesicourethral anastomosis with barbed suture and nonbarbed suture in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective cohort study involving 88 consecutive patients who underwent RARP. These patients were categorized into the barbed suture group (n = 50) and the nonbarbed suture group (n = 38). Urethral and periurethral damages determined by magnetic resonance imaging at nine months after RARP were compared using generalized linear models. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, uroflowmetry, and the 1-h pad test were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after RARP. The findings were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Confounding was adjusted for using propensity score covariate adjustment. RESULTS The likelihood of having Grade 2/3 urethral and periurethral damages was greater in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group (adjusted risk ratios: 2.98 and 3.85, respectively). IPSS, QOL index, and urinary leakage transiently increased at one month after RARP in both groups. QOL index was higher in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group at 1, 9, and 12 months (P = 0.023, P = 0.025, and P = 0.011, respectively). The barbed suture group had significantly more cases of urinary incontinence than the nonbarbed suture group at 3 months (P = 0.041). Other outcomes were comparable between the two groups at all time points. CONCLUSIONS This cohort study showed that, after RARP, barbed sutures during VUA induced more severe tissue damage as determined by MRI and greater transient aggravation of QOL and continence function than nonbarbed sutures. The present findings suggest that using nonbarbed sutures during VUA may facilitate earlier acquisition of urinary QOL and urinary continence.","output":"Effects of barbed suture during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on postoperative tissue damage and longitudinal changes in lower urinary tract outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that can stop the spread of the infection has been postulated as the definitive response to end the COVID-19 pandemic Far from being free of ethical conflicts, the introduction of a new vaccine in a situation of social, political and economic instability reactivates the tension among institutional power, people's autonomy and the dynamics of global markets This requires an ethical analysis that includes conflicts in the field of vaccine research and development, glob- al justice in vaccine distribution, prioritization decisions when the supply of vaccines does not meet demand and the positions that should be taken by public institutions to address vaccine hesitancy among people who either do not want to take the vaccine or raise doubts about it ? 2020 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and Universitat de Girona All rights reserved","output":"\\"Haste makes waste\\".

Wound infections are caused by the consortia of microbial species that keep on proliferating and produce various types of virulence factors that cause the development of chronic infections. The mono- or polymicrobial nature of surface wound infections is best characterized by its ability to form biofilm that renders antimicrobial resistance to commonly administered drugs due to poor biofilm matrix permeability. With an increasing incidence of chronic wound biofilm infections, there is an urgent need for non-conventional antimicrobial approaches, such as developing nanomaterials that have intrinsic antimicrobial-antibiofilm properties modulating the biochemical or biophysical parameters in the wound microenvironment in order to cause disruption and removal of biofilms, such as designing nanomaterials as efficient drug-delivery vehicles carrying antibiotics, bioactive compounds, growth factor antioxidants or stem cells reaching the infection sites and having a distinct mechanism of action in comparison to antibioticsfunctionalized nanoparticles (NPs) for better incursion through the biofilm matrix. NPs are thought to act by modulating the microbial colonization and biofilm formation in wounds due to their differential particle size, shape, surface charge and composition through alterations in bacterial cell membrane composition, as well as their conductivity, loss of respiratory activity, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrosation of cysteines of proteins, lipid peroxidation, DNA unwinding and modulation of metabolic pathways. For the treatment of chronic wounds, extensive research is ongoing to explore a variety of nanoplatforms, including metallic and nonmetallic NPs, nanofibers and self-accumulating nanocarriers. As the use of the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-entrenched pre-designed hydrogel sheet (MPS) is found to enhance wound healing, the bio-nanocomposites consisting of bacterial cellulose and magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite) are now successfully used for the healing of chronic wounds. With the objective of precise targeting, some kinds of intelligent nanoparticles are constructed to react according to the required environment, which are later incorporated in the dressings, so that the wound can be treated with nano-impregnated dressing material in situ. For the effective healing of skin wounds, high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells, controlled by nano 3D architectures, have been developed to encourage angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. In order to overcome the challenge of time and dose constraints during drug administration, the approach of combinatorial nano therapy is adopted, whereby AI will help to exploit the full potential of nanomedicine to treat chronic wounds.","output":"Engineered Nanotechnology: An Effective Therapeutic Platform for the Chronic Cutaneous Wound"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an extreme increase in the use of disposable masks. If the used disposable masks are not appropriately disposed of, they will enter the natural environment and lead to environmental pollution. In order to understand the impacts of disposable masks after being disposed of into the natural environment, aging experiments with simulated natural conditions were performed on the outer, inner, and middle layers of the masks to verify the aging characteristics of disposable masks. We analyzed the mechanical behavior, surface morphology, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of disposable masks treated with different levels of UV irradiation to understand the possible changes in the masks under UV. Results showed that the elongation at break, tensile strength, and maximum force of all three polypropylene (PP) mask layers decreased after UV irradiation, indicating chemical bond breakage. In the process of photoaging, each layer of the disposable masks showed a different degree of microscopic surface changes after UV irradiation, and these changes gradually intensified with the extension of UV exposure time. FT-IR results showed that functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups increased in each layer after UV irradiation. The results of this study support that, although the different layers of the disposable masks are all made of PP, they age differently in the environment. With the ever-increasing number of disposable masks in the environment, we need to further study the aging and degradation of disposable masks to better understand their potential impacts on the environment in the future. ? 2022 by the authors.

AIMS: We aimed to assess the self-reported confidence of postgraduate medical/surgical trainees in ROI in requesting, interpreting, and managing genomic data in patients with cancer, and to assess their selfreported experience, and demand for future training in this area. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of postgraduate trainees in four specialties (Medical and Radiation Oncology, Surgery, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G)), training in ROI, was undertaken. A bespoke electronic questionnaire was designed to capture data regarding preceding experience, and confidence across several hypothetical clinical scenarios involving genomic testing.

The challenge of any novel disease is that the gold standard has yet to be defined. METHODS We reanalysed published data on real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 to illustrate how predictive values vary with disease prevalence, sensitivity (set to values between 30% and 95%) and specificity (set to 99% or 99.98%). We used published data on chest CT and RT-qPCR to examine the potential of latent class analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR when no single gold standard exists. RESULTS For the various sensitivity values, the negative predictive value of a RT-qPCR test remained above 92% until a COVID-19 prevalence of > 10%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was more variable. For a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%, the PPV was less-than 10% at a prevalence of 0.1%, increasing to about 90% at a prevalence of 10%. This improved to a PPV of 85% and almost 100%, respectively, when specificity increased to 99.98%. In a restricted latent class analysis, the sensitivity was 97.1% and the specificity was 99.9%, which is similar to figures from the Danish Health Authority. However, derived predictive values depended on model specification. CONCLUSIONS A high risk of false-positives should be considered when extending the testing strategy, whereas false-negatives may occur during local outbreaks.

However, the latter are less well placed to cope with adverse effects. In particular, important advances towards sustainable development might be reversed. Tackling the pandemic and its effects therefore requires global cooperation as well as solidarity in the form of development assistance. Yet, support for development assistance among donor publics might be dampened by individual health-related and economic worries as well as decreasing trust in government during the pandemic. Against this backdrop, we investigate the possible effect of pandemic-induced worries on public support for development assistance as well as the moderating role of moral considerations and trust in government. Drawing on literature on aid attitudes, and using survey data for Germany provided by the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) project from April 2020 (N = 1,006), our analyses show that neither health-related nor economic worries are associated with less support for providing development assistance during the first wave of the pandemic. However, we observe a marginal interaction between health-related worries and trust in government in predicting support for development assistance. For those with high levels of trust in government the effect of worry regarding the loss of friends or relatives on support for development assistance is positive, whereas it is close to zero for those with low levels of trust. We conclude that at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic there was little need for concern by policy-makers endorsing development assistance as neither form of worry correlated negatively with public support for development assistance and trust was high. However, when worries recur and trust in government simultaneously decreases, public support for global solidarity may wane.","output":"Does the COVID-19 pandemic threaten global solidarity?

In severe cases, excess oxidative stress produced by a cytokine storm may generate excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to tissue damage in the lungs and elsewhere. As the potential role of RBCs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains controversial (1), we investigated for evidence of increased oxidative stress and increased thrombotic tendency in RBCs from patients with COVID-19 infection. Following ethical approval and written informed consent, we used flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II) to measure baseline RBC ROS following incubation with 2-7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF). RBC ROS were also measured following pre-incubation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (2mM) +/- antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (0.6mM). We also measured RBC surface expression of adhesion molecules CD44, CD47 and CD242, as well as CD147. Results were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). RBC ROS were measured in 22 COVID-19 positive patients and in 10 age matched healthy controls. One patient died from respiratory failure, whilst only 3 others required ITU admission for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation. There was no statistical difference in mean basal RBC DCF mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels between COVID-19 positive patients and controls. However, mean increase in RBC DCF MFI following H2O2 incubation was significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (1105.7+/-336.3) compared to the control group (843.4+/-256.7)( p= 0.042). The increase in RBC DCF MFI in the COVID-19 positive group correlated with CRP (p=0.014) but not with D-dimer, serum ferritin or any complete blood count (CBC) parameters. Incubation of RBC with 0.6 mM NAC for 30 minutes prior to H2O2 exposure caused a mean reduction in DCF MFI of 26.7% in the COVID-19 positive group. RBC expression of CD44, CD47, CD242 and CD147 were measured In a separate cohort of COVID-19 positive patients (n=32), and in 22 age matched controls. There were no statistically significant differences in mean expression levels of CD44, CD47 and CD242 between the 2 groups. However, mean RBC CD147 MFI expression was higher in the COVID-19 group (1319.64+/-374.76) compared to controls (1061.59+/-253.33) (p=0.018). There was no significant correlation between RBC CD147 MFI and D-dimer, CRP, serum ferritin or any CBC parameters in the COVID-19 positive group. However, 21 of the 32 COVID-19 positive patients had blood lactate levels measured and there was a positive correlation between CD147 MFI expression and blood lactate (R=0.56, p=0.0077). Induction of oxidative stress by H2O2 resulted in a greater increase in ROS in RBCs from COVID-19 patients compared to controls and with correlation to CRP, despite the fact that there were very few patients with severe disease in the study. This suggests a role for oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis. Pre-incubation with NAC attenuated this increase in ROS, suggesting a possible role for antioxidants in therapy. Increased RBC cell surface expression of adhesion molecules CD44, CD47 and CD242 can facilitate RBC interaction with platelets and/or endothelial cells, potentially contributing to thrombosis. We found no increase in their expression in COVID-19 patients compared to controls although RBCs may contribute to thrombosis in COVID-19 infection by other means (1). CD147 is tightly associated with and enables proper expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1, the lactate transporter for RBCs. We found increased surface expression of CD147 on RBCs of COVID-19 patients, whilst CD147 expression showed a moderate correlation with serum lactate levels, suggesting that RBCs in COVID-19 infection may be acting as a lactate sink to protect against lactic acidosis. In summary, our study suggests that COVID-19 infection causes increased oxidative stress and increased lactate influx in RBCs.

With consumption of a greater number of antioxidants and B-vitamins, CAs switched toward an anti-inflammatory score more effectively than AAs while AAs performed better than CAs in improving the anti-inflammatory score with the consumption of a greater number of minerals and vitamin D. Effective race-specific dietary modifications or supplementation with nutrients identified will be useful to improve proinflammatory diets toward anti-inflammatory. This approach could aid in controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics of a similar nature in women at risk for exposure.","output":"Racial differences in dietary choices and their relationship to inflammatory potential in childbearing age women at risk for exposure to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noroviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and it was recently revealed that noroviruses can infect B cells. We demonstrate that murine norovirus (MNV) infection can significantly impair B cell development in the bone marrow in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dependent, but interferon signaling independent manner. We also show that MNV replication is more pronounced in the absence of STAT1 in ex vivo cultured B cells. Interestingly, using bone marrow transplantation studies, we found that impaired B cell development requires Stat1(?/?) hematopoietic cells and Stat1(?/?) stromal cells, and that the presence of wild-type hematopoietic or stromal cells was sufficient to restore normal development of Stat1(?/?) B cells. These results suggest that B cells normally restrain norovirus replication in a cell autonomous manner, and that wild-type STAT1 is required to protect B cell development during infection.","output":"Murine norovirus inhibits B cell development in the bone marrow of STAT1-deficient mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory viral infection with unique features including a more chronic course and systemic disease manifestations including multiple organ involvement; and there are differences in disease severity between ethnic groups. The immunological basis for disease has not been fully characterised. Analysis of whole-blood RNA expression may provide valuable information on disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection within 10 days from onset of illness and a control group of 19 asymptomatic healthy volunteers with no known exposure to COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. Relevant demographic and clinical information was collected and a blood sample was drawn from all participants for whole-blood RNA sequencing. We evaluated differentially-expressed genes in COVID-19 patients (log2 fold change  1 versus healthy controls; false-discovery rate < 0.05) and associated protein pathways and compared these to published whole-blood signatures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. We developed a disease score reflecting the overall magnitude of expression of internally-validated genes and assessed the relationship between the disease score and clinical disease parameters. RESULTS: We found 135 differentially-expressed genes in the patients with COVID-19 (median age 35 years; 82% male; 36% Chinese, 53% South Asian ethnicity). Of the 117 induced genes, 14 were found in datasets from RSV and 40 from influenza; 95 genes were unique to COVID-19. Protein pathways were mostly generic responses to viral infections, including apoptosis by P53-associated pathway, but also included some unique pathways such as viral carcinogenesis. There were no major qualitative differences in pathways between ethnic groups. The composite gene-expression score was correlated with the time from onset of symptoms and nasal swab qPCR CT values (both p < 0.01) but was not related to participant age, gender, ethnicity or the presence or absence of chest X-ray abnormalities (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The whole-blood transcriptome of COVID-19 has overall similarity with other respiratory infections but there are some unique pathways that merit further exploration to determine clinical relevance. The approach to a disease score may be of value, but needs further validation in a population with a greater range of disease severity.

Therefore, long-term, real-time, and accurate monitoring of intraocular pressure is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma patients. The use of wearable devices for real-time ocular diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma patients is an effective approach. However, the current commonly used intraocular pressure measurement and monitoring technology is difficult to meet the diagnosis and monitoring needs of glaucoma patients in terms of size, measurement accuracy, power consumption, and intelligence. Therefore, facing the needs of glaucoma disease treatment, this topic studies an implantable flexible intraocular pressure sensor for long-term continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients and mainly focuses on the working principle, structural design, process fabrication, measurement and control system, characterization, and performance test of the intraocular pressure sensor.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are at least 3.5 times more likely than white persons to contract COVID-19. Limited access to running water is one of the main factors contributing to this elevated rate of incidence. This report describes current conditions among Tribes in the Colorado River Basin. It outlines the four main challenges in drinking water access: (1) Native American households are more likely to lack piped water services than any other racial group;(2) Inadequate water quality is pervasive in Indian country;(3) Existing water infrastructure is deteriorating or inadequate;and (4) Operation and maintenance of water systems is a critical component of ensuring long-term water security. The report also examines existing federal assistance programs to provide drinking water access to Tribes. In exchange for the cession of millions of acres of lands, Tribes received certain promises from the federal government. These promises often included the establishment of a reservation as a permanent homeland for Tribes. Based upon an underlying trust responsibility, the federal government has a duty to protect Tribal treaty rights, lands, assets, and resources. Access to a clean, reliable supply of water is basic to human health and clearly a necessary component to providing a habitable and permanent homeland. In at least partial recognition and fulfillment of its treaty and trust responsibility to provide access to clean water for Tribes, various federal agencies have established programs that provide support for water related projects. However, these programs are often underfunded and have other limitations. As a result, obtaining significant progress in providing universal access to clean water for all Americans has remained elusive. Finally, the report concludes with policy recommendations to address Tribal community water needs. Key recommendations include adopting a whole of government approach and fully funding federal programs related to Tribal drinking water projects. A window of opportunity has opened to address water insecurity in Indian country. It is critical that action be taken before that window closes and these issues are ignored for several more generations.","output":"Universal Access to Clean Water for Tribes in the Colorado River Basin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resource scarcity was concerned in the initial surge of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Transition metals found in PM are known to contribute significantly to the exacerbation of respiratory ailments. Exposure to these constituents results in the induction of oxidative stress in the bronchial epithelium, thus promoting the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, it is important to know the contributions of PM(2.5) constituents to further investigate their relationship with toxic responses and associated health risks. PM(2.5) samples from three rural (Humacao, Guayama, and Guayanilla) and two urban (more populated) sites (Bayamn and Ponce) from Puerto Rico were analyzed for various inorganic constituents. A total of 59 trace elements were analyzed, of which eight were considered with the greatest toxic potential. The highest annual average concentration of PM(2.5) was reported at the urban site of Ponce (5.82  1.40 g m(?3)), while Bayamns average concentration was not as high (4.69  1.30 g m(?3)) compared to concentrations at the rural sites Humacao, Guayama, and Guayanilla (4.33  1.20 g m(?3), 4.93  1.50 g m(?3), and 4.88  1.20 g m(?3) respectively. The concentration at the Ponce site exhibited the highest summer value (7.57 g m(?3)) compared to that of all the rural sites (~ 6.40 g m(?3)). The lowest summer PM(2.5) values were obtained at the Humacao site with an average of 5.76 g m(?3).

Quantifying filtration efficiency of different kinds of masks and linings for aerosols that fall within the most penetrating particle size (80-400 nm) is critical to limiting viral transmission. The objective of our experiment was to compare the real-world filtering efficiency of different face masks for fine aerosols (350 nm) in laboratory simulations. Methods: We performed a simulated bench test that measured the filtering efficiency of N95 vs. N99 masks with elastomeric lining in relation to baseline (background) aerosol generation. A mannequin head was placed within a chamber and was attached to an artificial lung simulator. Particles of known size (350  6 nm aerodynamic diameter) were aerosolized into the chamber while simulating breathing at physiological settings of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and airflow. Particle counts were measured between the mannequin head and the lung simulator at the tracheal airway location. Results: Baseline particle counts without a filter (background) were 2,935  555 (SD) cm(?3), while the N95 (1348  92 cm(?3)) and N99 mask with elastomeric lining (279  164 cm(?3); p <0.0001) exhibit lower counts due to filtration. Conclusion: The filtration efficiency of the N95 (54.1%) and N99 (90.5%) masks were lower than the filtration efficiency rating.

METHODS A one-year prospective study was conducted between May 2008 and April 2009 within a team of three experienced endocrine surgeons. The measure of surgical performance was based on the detection of immediate postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy by laryngoscopy. Individual learning curves associated with IONM acquisition were drawn with the cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart. Each surgeon was questioned about possible changes he had experienced in his own surgical technique after the introduction of IONM. RESULTS A total of 475 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery with IONM were included. The pattern of learning curves varied among surgeons and ranged from 35 to 304 procedures required for complete IONM acquisition. The surgeon with the longest learning curve also described a drastic modification of his technique related to nerve dissection. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative nerve monitoring can induce changes in surgical practice. The different learning curve patterns among surgeons may reflect the variable degree to which surgeons will modify their own dissection technique.

We investigated this in our large prospective cohort of UK healthcare workers undergoing routine asymptomatic PCR testing. MethodsWe assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) (up to 10-months after first dose) and infection-acquired immunity by comparing time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals using a Cox regression-model, adjusted by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine-manufacturer/dosing-interval, demographics and workplace exposures. ResultsOf 35,768 participants, 27% (n=9,488) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 97% had two-doses (79% BNT162b2 long-interval, 8% BNT162b2 short-interval, 8% ChAdOx1). There were 2,747 primary infections and 210 reinfections between 07/12/2020 and 21/09/2021. Adjusted VE (aVE) decreased from 81% (95% CI 68%-89%) 14-73 days after dose-2 to 46% (95% CI 22%-63%) >6-months; with no significant difference for short-interval BNT162b2 but significantly lower aVE (50% (95% CI 18%-70%) 14-73 days after dose-2 from ChAdOx1. Protection from infection-acquired immunity showed evidence of waning in unvaccinated follow-up but remained consistently over 90% in those who received two doses of vaccine, even in those infected over 15-months ago. ConclusionTwo doses of BNT162b2 vaccination induce high short-term protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which wanes significantly after six months.

Symptoms can be unspecific, and an etiologic diagnosis is rarely established because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tools. Improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. It has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether access to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay panel for etiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rate in primary care clinical settings. METHODS: Adult patients with symptoms of ARTI were prospectively included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed by using a multiplex real-time PCR method targeting thirteen viruses and two bacteria. Patients were recruited at 12 outpatient units from October 2006 through April 2009, and samples were collected on the day of inclusion (initial visit) and after 10 days (follow-up visit). Patients were randomised in an open-label treatment protocol to receive a rapid or delayed result (on the following day or after eight to twelve days). The primary outcome measure was the antibiotic prescription rate at the initial visit, and the secondary outcome was the total antibiotic prescription rate during the study period. RESULTS: A total sample of 447 patients was randomised. Forty-one were excluded, leaving 406 patients for analysis. In the group of patients randomised for a rapid result, 4.5% (9 of 202) of patients received antibiotics at the initial visit, compared to 12.3% (25 of 204) (P = 0.005) of patients in the delayed result group. At follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups: 13.9% (28 of 202) in the rapid result group and 17.2% (35 of 204) in the delayed result group (P = 0.359), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Access to a rapid method for etiologic diagnosis of ARTIs may reduce antibiotic prescription rates at the initial visit in an outpatient setting. To sustain this effect, however, it seems necessary to better define how to follow and manage the patient according to the result of the test, which warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. AIM: As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women's perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. METHODS: We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N=205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours.

However, the ideal dose and availability of butorphanol for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluated the 95% effective dose (ED95) of butorphanol and sufentanil in GI endoscopy and compared their clinical efficacy, especially regarding the recovery time. METHODS The study was divided into two parts. For the first part, voluntary patients who needed GI endoscopy anesthesia were recruited to measure the ED95 of butorphanol and sufentanil needed to achieve successful sedation before GI endoscopy using the sequential method (the Dixon up-and-down method). The second part was a double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred cases of painless GI endoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 100), including group B (butorphanol at the ED95 dose) and group S (sufentanil at the ED95 dose). Propofol was infused intravenously as the sedative in both groups. The recovery time, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, hand grip strength, fatigue severity scores, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and incidence of dizziness were recorded. RESULTS The ED95 of butorphanol for painless GI endoscopy was 9.07 g/kg (95% confidence interval: 7.81-19.66 g/kg). The ED95 of sufentanil was 0.1 g/kg (95% CI, 0.079-0.422 g/kg). Both butorphanol and sufentanil provided a good analgesic effect for GI endoscopy. However, the recovery time for butorphanol was significantly shorter than that for sufentanil (P < 0.05, group B vs. group S:21.26  7.70 vs. 24.03  7.80 min).

METHODS: Using a mathematical model with two age groups paired with optimization algorithms, we determine the optimal vaccination strategy with one and two doses of vaccine to minimize cumulative overall infections, symptomatic infections, and deaths. We explore counterfactual vaccination scenarios in three distinct settings: Maela, the largest refugee camp in Thailand, with high in- and out-migration; NDjamena, Chad, a densely populated region; and Haiti, where departments are connected by rivers and roads. RESULTS: Over the short term under limited vaccine supply, the optimal strategies for all objectives prioritize one dose to the older age group (over five years old), irrespective of setting and level of vaccination coverage. As more vaccine becomes available, it is optimal to administer a second dose for long-term protection. With enough vaccine to cover the whole population with one dose, the optimal strategies can avert up to 30% to 90% of deaths and 36% to 92% of symptomatic infections across the three settings over one year. The one-dose optimal strategies can avert 1.2 to 1.8 times as many cases and deaths compared to the standard two-dose strategy.

However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages. Methods In this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the populations coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages. Results We observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage.

Conclusions In summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populationals coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.","output":"New SARS-CoV-2 lineages could evade CD8+ T-cells response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for hospitalizations of cases with positive and negative COVID-19 tests.

The most identified reason for non\\\\compliance was lack of trust about vaccine efficacy and its adverse events. Around 80% of participants expressed positive attitude towards influenza vaccine and the vast majority (98%) agreed to uptake the vaccine during pandemic. There was significant positive association between attitude score and influenza vaccine uptake. Raising awareness about vaccine and ensuring vaccine availability were the main suggestions by HCWs to improve vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was positive attitude towards influenza vaccine, yet vaccination coverage was suboptimal particularly among those working in university hospitals.

Genome reductions tend toward the energetically favorable removal of unnecessary, redundant, or nonfunctional genes. However, without mechanisms to compensate for these losses, deleterious mutation and genetic drift might otherwise overwhelm a population. Among the mechanisms employed to counter gene loss and share evolutionary success within a population, gene transfer agents (GTAs) are increasingly becoming recognized as important contributors. Although viral in origin, GTA particles package fragments of their \\"host\\" genome for distribution within a population of cells, often in a synchronized manner, rather than selfishly packaging genes necessary for their spread. Microbes as diverse as archaea and alpha-proteobacteria have been known to produce GTA particles, which are capable of transferring selective advantages such as virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this review, we discuss the various types of GTAs identified thus far, focusing on a defined set of symbiotic alpha-proteobacteria known to carry them. Drawing attention to the predicted presence of these genes, we discuss their potential within the selective marine and terrestrial environments occupied by mutualistic, parasitic, and endosymbiotic microbes.","output":"Gene Transfer Agents in Symbiotic Microbes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were common. We aimed to investigate the rate and risk factors of recurrent positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (n=3513) were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 during the hospitalization. We analyzed the recurrent positive rate after consecutive negative results and its relationship to demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among 599 enrolled COVID-19 patients, the median time for viral RNA shedding was 24 days (IQR, 19-33 days). The positive rate of RT-PCR was 35.9% (215/599), 17.0% (65/383) and 12.4% (23/185) after one, two and three consecutive negative RT-PCR test results respectively. Medians of CT-values of initial positive test, rebound positive after two consecutive negative results, and rebound positive after three consecutive negative results were 28.8, 32.8 and 36.1 respectively. Compare with male patients, females had a significant higher rate of recurrent positive RT-PCR after three consecutive negative results (18.2%, 18/99 vs. 5.8%, 5/86, p=0.013).

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant overloads in the work of health systems in many countries, a shortage of beds and staff, which contributes to a decrease in adherence to measures to prevent and control nosocomial infections, which can significantly worsen the course of viral pneumonia. Aim. To assess the possibility of the formation of hospital strains of multidrug-resistant microorganisms in hospitals repurposed to provide medical care to patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study included patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19 (ICD codes U07.1, U07.2), who were admitted to two large hospitals repurposed for the treatment of this infection. The data of microbiological studies of the biomaterial associated with the respiratory tract (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates) obtained from 1101 patients from May to January 2021 were analyzed using a combination of molecular genetic methods (RAPD-PCR, detection of integrons and the carbapenemase gene bla NDM.), and molecular typing of carbapenem-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was carried out. Results. It was found that carbapenem resistant gram-negative bacteria predominate in the structure of the nosocomial microbiota of the respiratory tract of patients with COVID-19 in both hospitals. Based on molecular typing made the wide distribution of several genetic lines of integron-positive carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was detected. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the spread and circulation of bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance in hospitals. This study has demonstrated the possibility of the formation of hospital strains of nosocomial infections in COVID-19 hospitals, which justifies the need to improve infection control measures in the context of a new coronavirus infection pandemic. ?

Approximately half of the stent migrations are in the proximal direction. In this study, we reported a rare case of proximal trans-diaphragmatic stent migration to the lower lobe of the right lung with the formation of a biliary-bronchial fistula (BBF). CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (type 3B by Bismuth-Corlette) complicated by posthepatic jaundice. To relieve jaundice there were performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic sphincterotomy, endobiliary stent placement (10 Fr, 150 mm). A restenting (11.5 Fr, 130 mm) was performed in 2.5 months due to endobiliary tube occlusion. In the next 2 months, coughing attacks and biliptysis have appeared in the patient. A CT scan showed penetration of the liver, diaphragm, and lower lobe of the right lung with the proximal part of the stent and caused BBF formation. Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial therapy was administrated for 14 days and BBF was closed. Stent retrieval from the right hemithorax and endobiliary restenting was performed in 9 months after primary stenting. During follow-up, appropriate positioning and functioning of the stent were observed. CONCLUSION: BBF formation is a rare complication of endobiliary stenting, which can be successfully treated by anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy, followed by transpapillary stent retrieval.","output":"Non-Operative Management of Bronchobiliary Fistula Due to Proximal Migration of Biliary Stent in a Patient With Unresectable Klatskin Tumor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of empirical and even directed antimicrobial management of patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is problematic; antibiotics are used frequently among these patients to treat confirmed or suspected coinfection or just the symptoms.

METHODS: We included consecutive adults admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from July 2020CMay 2021. Glycaemic status was defined by admission HbA1c. Clinical deterioration was defined by radiological progression/new oxygen requirement/intensive care requirement/death. COVID-19 survivors had Nab measurements at 1-month, 2-month, 3-month and 6-month post-discharge. RESULTS: Among 605 patients (96.9% non-severe COVID-19; 325 normoglycaemia, 185 prediabetes, 95 diabetes), 74 (12.2%) had clinical deterioration, more likely with worse glycaemic status and higher HbA1c (p < 0.001).

Few studies so far have critically reviewed about medical responses to disasters and little information exists pertaining to the initiatives being undertaken by health sector from the perspective of basic disaster management cycle. This article aimed to review emergency health responses to disasters and other related interventions which have been undertaken in the health sector. Methods: Relevant documents were identified by searches in the websites of different sectors in Ethiopian and international non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies. Using selected keywords, articles were also searched in the data bases of Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar. In addition, pertinent articles from non-indexed journals were referred to. Results: Disaster management system in Ethiopia focused on response, recovery, and rehabilitation from 1974 to 1988; while the period between 1988 and 1993 marked the transition phase towards a more comprehensive approach. Theoretically, from 1993 onwards, the disaster management system has fully integrated the mitigation, prevention, and preparedness phases into already existing response and recovery approach, particularly for drought. This policy has changed the emergency response practices and the health sector has taken some initiatives in the area of emergency health care. Hence, drought early warning system, therapeutic feeding program in hospitals, health centers and posts in drought prone areas to manage promptly acute malnutrition cases have all been put in place. In addition, public health disease emergencies have been responded to at all levels of health care system. Conclusions: Emergency health responses to drought and its ramifications such as acute malnutrition and epidemics have become more comprehensive in the context of basic disaster management phases; and impacts of drought and epidemics seem to be declining. However, the remaining challenge is to address disasters arising from other hazards such as flooding in terms of mitigation, prevention, preparedness and integrating them in the health care system.

Data were collected after ethical approval from 1st January 2020 to 20th January 2020 during the second COVID-19 wave. Participants with a history of diagnosed psychiatric illness such as OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and those taking relevant medications were excluded from the study. The online questionnaire included Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Revised Padua Inventory-Contamination Subscale (PI-CS), which were used to assess OCD symptoms and aversion for contamination respectively. Participants filled Y-BOCS twice, once for pre-pandemic score (based on self-recall), and a second time during 2nd wave of COVID-19. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS v23.0 (Armonk, N.Y., USA). RESULT: The study included 711 participants (Males: 29.8%, Mean age: 21.59  1.52 years) from over 46 medical colleges and over 44 cities of Pakistan. The mean pre-pandemic and mid-2nd wave Y-BOCS scores were 11.86  6.02 and 15.61  7.41 respectively. The mean PI-CS score was 17.27  9.17. Twenty five percent (n = 176) of students developed new onset OCD symptomology during pandemic, while seventy percent (n = 497) suffered from worsened Y-BOCS score during pandemic. New onset OCD symptomology was associated with age less than 20 years (p = 0.02), higher PI-CS score (p = 0.001) and studying in preclinical years (p = 0.002). Worsening of YBOCS score had significant association with female gender (p = 0.02), attending pandemic related awareness seminar (p = 0.027), studying in preclinical years (p < 0.001) and age less than 20 years (p < 0.001).

However, due to the large variety in the mitigation policies adopted by various state and local governments; and unpredictable social events during the pandemic, it is incredibly challenging to develop models that can provide accurate long-term forecasting for disease spread. In this paper, to address such a challenge, we introduce a new multi-period curve fitting model to give a short-term prediction of the COVID-19 spread in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) within the United States. Since most counties/cities within a single MSA usually adopt similar mitigation strategies, this allows us to substantially diminish the variety in adopted mitigation strategies within an MSA. At the same time, the multi-period framework enables us to incorporate the impact of significant social events and mitigation strategies in the model. We also propose a simple heuristic to estimate the COVID-19 fatality based on our spread prediction.

Although many DR approaches have been introduced for treating different diseases, only structure-based DR (SBDR) methods can be employed as the first therapeutic option against the COVID-19 pandemic because they rely on the rudimentary information about the diseases such as the sequence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genome. Hence, to try out new treatments for the disease, the first attempts have been made based on the SBDR methods which seem to be among the proper choices for discovering the potential medications against the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Given the importance of SBDR approaches, in the present review, well-known SBDR methods are summarized, and their merits are investigated. Then, the databases and software applications, utilized for repurposing the drugs against COVID-19, are introduced. Besides, the identified drugs are categorized based on their targets.

Older adults, which frequently present multiple chronic comorbidities, are more susceptible to COVID-19 and experience more likely negative outcomes, in terms of disease severity and mortality. However, chronological age per se may not entirely explain the dramatic scenario described among the frailest and oldest persons. Comorbidities and functional status may indeed play a relevant role. Patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection are the same at risk of malnutrition, namely older adults and multimorbid individuals. In fact, COVID-19 can negatively impact on nutritional status, both in patients admitted to the hospital with the most severe manifestations of the infection, as well as in those who experience milder/asymptomatic forms of the disease. Despite being quite difficult in these emergency circumstances, nutritional status needs to be assessed in all COVID-19 patients upon admission and during hospital stay. Early nutritional support should be guaranteed in order to improve several malnutrition-related adverse outcomes.

The input of smart lighting system can be either solar panel or conventional grid supply. Use of solar panel involves utilization of solar renewable source. Therefore, the power from the grid dependence is minimized. As it uses solar panels, it can be used in rural areas where there is scarcity of electricity or not yet reach. As per the requirement, even grid supply can be used.

It has been observed that lethality seems to be related to the age of patients. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ageing causes some modifications at a molecular level. Objective: The study aims to shed out light on a possible link between the increased COVID-19 lethality and the molecular changes that occur in elderly people. Methods: We considered public datasets on ageing-related genes and their expression at tissue level. We selected interactors that are known to be related to ageing process. Then, we performed a networkbased analysis to identify interactors significantly related to both SARS-CoV-2 and ageing. Finally, we investigated changes on the expression level of coding genes at tissue, gender and age level. Results We observed a significant intersection between some SARS-CoV-2 interactors and ageing-related genes suggesting that those genes are particularly affected by COVID-19 infection. Our analysis evidenced that virus infection particularly affects ageing molecular mechanisms centred around proteins EEF2, NPM1, HMGA1, HMGA2, APEX1, CHEK1, PRKDC, and GPX4. We found that HMGA1, and NPM1 have a different expression in lung of males, while HMGA1, APEX1, CHEK1, EEF2, and NPM1 present changes in expression in males due to aging effects.

We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation (P2-VP8-P[4],[6],[8]). METHODS: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 study was done at three South African research sites. Healthy adults (aged 18-45 years), toddlers (aged 2-3 years), and infants (aged 6-8 weeks, &#8805;37 weeks' gestation, and without previous receipt of rotavirus vaccination), all without HIV infection, were eligible for enrolment. In the dose-escalation phase, adults and toddlers were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of five) to receive 30 g or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo, and infants were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of four) to receive 15 g, 30 g, or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo. In the expanded phase, infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 15 g, 30 g, or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo, in block sizes of four. Participants, parents of participants, and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. Adults received an intramuscular injection of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid muscle on the day of randomisation (day 0), day 28, and day 56; toddlers received a single injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on day 0. Infants in both phases received an injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 28, and 56, at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions (grade 2 or worse) within 7 days and adverse events and serious adverse events within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one injection. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were analysed in infants in either phase who received all planned injections, had blood samples analysed at the relevant timepoints, and presented no major protocol violations considered to have an effect on the immunogenicity results of the study, and included serum anti-P2-VP8 IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres and responses measured 4 weeks after the final injection in vaccine compared with placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02646891. FINDINGS: Between Feb 15, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, 30 adults (12 each in the 30 g and 90 g groups and six in the placebo group), 30 toddlers (12 each in the 30 g and 90 g groups and six in the placebo group), and 557 infants (139 in the 15 g group, 140 in the 30 g group, 139 in the 90 g group, and 139 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned, received at least one dose, and were assessed for safety. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events, or unsolicited adverse events, between vaccine and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse events within 28 days of injection in adults, whereas one serious adverse event occurred in a toddler (febrile convulsion in the 30 g group) and 23 serious adverse events (four in placebo, ten in 15 g, four in 30 g, and five in 90 g groups) occurred among 20 infants, most commonly respiratory tract infections. One death occurred in an infant within 28 days of injection due to pneumococcal meningitis. In 528 infants (130 in placebo, 132 in 15 g, 132 in 30 g, and 134 in 90 g groups), adjusted anti-P2-VP8 IgG seroresponses (&#8805;4-fold increase from baseline) to P[4], P[6], and P[8] antigens were significantly higher in the 15 g, 30 g, and 90 g groups (99-100%) than in the placebo group (10-29%; p<00001). Although significantly higher than in placebo recipients (9-10%), anti-P2-VP8 IgA seroresponses (&#8805;4-fold increase from baseline) to each individual antigen were modest (20-34%) across the 15 g, 30 g, and 90 g groups.

It is paramount to identify patients at the highest risk of developing severe COVID-19, thus improving resource allocation. Methods: A systematic literature search for articles published in English between the date of database inception and January 31, 2021, was performed in EMBASE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Cochrane CENTRAL. Conclusions: Several artificial intelligence-based approaches have been conceived to ease the pressure on the overloaded health system and assist clinicians in the prognostic profiling of COVID-19 patients. Risk assessment and categorisation are essential: By identifying the more likely subjects to suffer from an acute disease, it might be possible to plan a closer monitoring and/or earlier therapeutic intervention. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) may support physicians in adjusting their management strategy according to the prognostic estimation, resulting in improved quality of care.

Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN- response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN- refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF- and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction.

METHODS This subset analysis of seven European sites from a multicentre retrospective study included patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery and treated with Permacol? surgical implant. Inguinal, parastomal, diaphragmatic, perineal, and hiatal repairs were excluded. Only patients with at least 12 months of follow-up after surgery were included. RESULTS A total of 109 patients (56 males and 53 females) were included. Patients had a median of two comorbidities (range 0-6). Thirty-three per cent of patients were treated for recurrent hernia. All but one case used an open approach. Sixty-six per cent were Center for Disease Control wound class II-IV at the time of surgery. Fascial closure was achieved in 69%. Median follow-up length was 720 days (range 368-2857). Recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 9.2 and 18.3 %, respectively, and were higher in cases without fascial closure.

There is growing evidence, however, that while organisational changes to healthcare delivery have occurred to protect those vulnerable to the virus (staff and patients), these may lead to indirect, potentially harmful consequences, particularly to vulnerable groups including pregnant women. These encompass reduced access to antenatal and postnatal care, with a lack of in-person clinics impacting the ability to screen for physical, psychological and social issues such as elevated blood pressure, mental health issues and sex-based violence. Indirect consequences also encompass a lack of equity when considering the inclusion of pregnant women in COVID-19 research and their absence from vaccine trials, leading to a lack of safety data for breastfeeding and pregnant women. The risk-benefit analysis of these changes to healthcare delivery remains to be fully evaluated, but the battle against COVID-19 cannot come at the expense of losing existing quality standards in other areas of healthcare, especially for maternal health.","output":"Pandemics and maternal health: the indirect effects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Of the 971 patients admitted to our Clinic with suspected COVID-19, 15 (1.5%) presented with two consecutive attacks of diarrhea.

Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19 patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury.

PRECISION and PRECISE are among the first randomised studies to evaluate the new MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) pathway with a non-paired design to detect clinically significant prostate cancer and avoid unnecessary treatment. The trials' results individually demonstrated non-inferiority of MRI-TB compared to TRUS biopsy. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was planned from the outset of the two trials in parallel and this IPD meta-analysis aims to further elucidate the utility of MRI-TB as the optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021249263). A search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Registered Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed up until 4th February 2021. Only randomised controlled trials (PRECISE, PRECISION and other eligible trials) comparing the MRI-targeted biopsy pathway and traditional TRUS biopsy pathway will be included. The primary outcome of the review is the proportion of men diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer in each arm (Gleason  3+4 = 7). IPD and study-level data and characteristics will be sought from eligible studies. Analyses will be done primarily using an intention-to-treat approach, and a one-step IPD meta-analysis will be performed using generalised linear mixed models. A non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage points will be used. Heterogeneity will be quantified using the variance parameters from the mixed model.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \\"phosphate tweezer\\" CLR01, a \\"carboxylate tweezer\\" CLR05, and a \\"phosphate clip\\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.","output":"Supramolecular Mechanism of Viral Envelope Disruption by Molecular Tweezers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of coronavirus that spreads primarily by close contact.

Spatial and temporal analyses are crucial drivers to apprehending the pattern of diseases over space and time. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the significance of distance to the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using the Geographic Information System. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to analyze datasets of each month in ArcGIS. March, April, May, and June exhibited patterns with no significant peaks, while July and August exhibited patterns with two statistically significant peaks.

Therefore, a significant difference in the clustering of COVID-19 over distances between July and August was established. This indicated that progression in the spread of the virus increased the virus's spatial coverage while the distance of risk of exposure decreased.

This study addressed whether there is strong homology between a SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein and a Mycobacterium bovis protein that would allow for stronger, more specific immune protection. The study also showed the utility of immunohistochemistry in the diagnostic pathology laboratory for elucidating this information. Immunohistochemistry documented that an antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope, but not the spike or membrane proteins, strongly cross hybridized to 11/11 Mycobacterial species tested, including M. bovis. BlastP analysis showed high homology of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with 12 consecutive amino acids of the protein LytR C, which is a consensus protein unique to Mycobacteria. Six additional cases of human tuberculosis with few organisms showed that the viral envelope specific antibody (5/6) was more accurate than the AFB stain (2/6) for diagnostic purposes. These data indicate BCG vaccination induces a specific immunity against SARS CoV-2 that targets the viral envelope protein that is essential for infectivity.

The classic representation of the Plutchiks wheel follows the principles of proximity and opposition between pairs of emotions: spatial proximity in this model is also a semantic proximity, as adjacent emotions elicit a complex emotion (a primary dyad) when triggered together; spatial opposition is a semantic opposition as well, as positive emotions are opposite to negative emotions.
