However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the release of NETs in COVID-19 remain unclear. Using a single-cell transcriptome analysis we observed that the expression of GSDMD and inflammasome-related genes were increased in neutrophils from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, high expression of GSDMD was found associated with NETs structures in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients. The activation of GSDMD in neutrophils requires live SARS-CoV-2 and occurs after neutrophil infection via ACE2 receptors and serine protease TMPRSS2. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the treatment with GSDMD inhibitor (disulfiram) reduced NETs release and organ damage. These results demonstrated that GSDMD-dependent NETosis plays a critical role in COVID-19 immunopathology, and suggests that GSDMD inhibitors, can be useful to COVID-19 treatment.

Critically and noncritically ill patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia were recruited. For each patient, we performed basic coagulation tests, quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins, an evaluation of the fibrinolytic system and determination of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and ADAMTS13. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. The study involved 62 patients (31 ICU, 31 non-ICU). The coagulation parameters assessment demonstrated normal median prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in our cohort and all coagulation factors were within normal range. PAI-1 median levels were elevated (median 52.6 ng/ml; IQR 37.2C85.7), as well as vWF activity (median 216%; IQR 196C439) and antigen (median 174%; IQR 153.5C174.1).

The exacerbated immune response triggered by respiratory influenza virus infection causes severe pulmonary damage and contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality. Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10) belongs to the RGS protein family that act as GTPase activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins to terminate signaling pathways downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. While RGS10 is highly expressed in immune cells, in particular monocytes and macrophages, where it has strong anti-inflammatory effects, its physiological role in the respiratory immune system has not been explored yet. Here, we show that Rgs10 negatively modulates lung immune and inflammatory responses associated with severe influenza H1N1 virus respiratory infection in a mouse model. In response to influenza A virus challenge, mice lacking RGS10 experience enhanced weight loss and lung viral titers, higher mortality and significantly faster disease onset. Deficiency of Rgs10 upregulates the levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increases myeloid leukocyte accumulation in the infected lung, markedly neutrophils, monocytes, and inflammatory monocytes, which is associated with more pronounced lung damage. Consistent with this, influenza-infected Rgs10-deficent lungs contain more neutrophil extracellular traps and exhibit higher neutrophil elastase activities than wild-type lungs. Overall, these findings propose a novel, in vivo role for RGS10 in the respiratory immune system controlling myeloid leukocyte infiltration, viral clearance and associated clinical symptoms following lethal influenza challenge.

This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. \\"First come, first served\\" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","output":"Adult ICU Triage During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Who Will Live and Who Will Die?

Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets.

We examined inflammatory biomarkers known to increase with mental stress (speech task), including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) among 562 patients with stable CHD. Inflammatory response, the difference between post-stress and resting values, was examined as a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using subdistribution hazards models for competing risks adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medications. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure. All biomarkers were standardized.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy with a gel-sealed hand-assist access device (GelPort), which is a wound sealing device that permits the access of the hand to the surgical field, free trocar site choice within it, and rapid conversion to open surgery if necessary, while preserving the pneumoperitoneum/pneumoretroperitoneum. METHODS Seventy-five consecutive donors receiving this procedure were retrospectively studied. A 2-cm skin incision was made at the midpoint between the tip of the 12th rib and superior border of the iliac bone in the midaxillary line, through which retroperitoneal space was made. Preperitoneal wound with a 6 - 7-cm pararectal incision in the upper abdominal region was connected to the retroperitoneal space. A GelPort was put inside the pararectal surgical wound. The principle was pure retroperitoneoscopic surgery; hand-assist was applied for retraction of the kidney in the renal vessel control and graft extraction. RESULTS The mean operation time including waiting time for recipient preparation was 242.237.0 (range: 214.0-409.0) min, and the mean amount of blood loss was 164.3146.6 (range: 10.0-1020.0) ml. The mean WIT was 2.81.0 (range: 1.0-6.0) min. The shortage of renal vessels or ureter was observed in none of the grafts. No donor experienced blood transfusion, open conversion, or injury of other organs. Blood loss was greater in patients with body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher than in those with BMI of <25 kg/m2 (218.498.8 vs. 154.8152.1 ml, P=0.031). No donor had postoperative ileus or reported wound pain leading to decreased activity of daily life or wound cosmetic problem. CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneoscopic hand-assisted donor nephrectomy with the mentioned approach was suggested to be a feasible option without compromising safety, although further improvement in surgical techniques is warranted.","output":"Retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy with a gel-sealed hand-assist access device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early 2022, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global challenge.

The development was completed in October 2019 and rollout for use to occupational therapist (OT), Physiotherapist (PT) and speech therapist (ST). During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, rehabilitation service was seriously interrupted. TR was used extensively as a novel mean of service delivery model to bridge the demand for rehabilitation service. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the design and development process of TR. And (2) as an observational study, to study how the TR platform was used to overcome the disruption of rehabilitation service during the COVID-2019 pandemic. METHODS: TR was developed utilizing four core determinants of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as guiding principle. A generic prescription platform called Activity Base Prescription System (ABPS) and a mobile app called Rehabilitation App were built. Five outcomes were used to examine the utilization of TR both before and during the pandemic periods that included throughput, patient demographic, patient conditions, workforce, satisfaction from patient and staff. RESULTS: There was tremendous increase in use of TR during pandemic. The total number of patient prescribed up till July 2020 were 9101. The main age distribution prescribed most was between 51 to 70 years old. It was found that TR was used to a much wider scope of patient conditions than the original development plan. More than 1112 therapists prescribed TR to patients which constituted to 50.6% of total workforce. Moreover, there was high satisfaction rate from patient 4.2/5 and high compliance rate to prescribed rehabilitation activities (81.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that TR in the form of generic prescription platform and mobile app can be an effective mean to provide rehabilitation to patient. During outbreak period, TR has been used extensive and effectively to mitigate service disruption. Our finding also supported the high satisfaction of TR by patient. However, longer study is required to demonstrate the sustained use of TR especially after the pandemic.","output":"Combating Rehabilitation Service Disruption during COVID-2019 outbreak with Tele-rehabilitation in Hong Kong: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our previous study demonstrated that chickens immunized subcutaneously with an Eimeria recombinant profilin protein vaccine emulsified in a Quil A/cholesterol/DDA/Carbopol (QCDC) adjuvant developed partial protection against experimental avian coccidiosis compared with animals immunized with profilin alone. Because in ovo vaccination is presently used in commercial applications worldwide throughout the poultry industry, the current study was undertaken to investigate chicken embryo vaccination with profilin plus QCDC adjuvant. Eighteen day-old embryos were immunized with isotonic saline (control), profilin alone, QCDC alone, or profilin plus QCDC, and orally challenged with live Eimeria maxima at 7 days post-hatch. Body weight gain, fecal oocyst output, and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity. While immunization with profilin alone or QCDC alone did not alter body weight gain of infected chickens compared with the saline control group, vaccination with profilin plus QCDC increased body weight gain such that it was equal to the uninfected controls. Immunization with profilin plus QCDC also reduced fecal oocyst shedding compared with unimmunized controls, although in this case QCDC failed to provide an adjuvant effect since no difference was observed between the profilin-only and profilin/QCDC groups. Finally, increased levels of transcripts encoding IL-1, IL-15, and IFN- were seen in the intestinal tissues of animals given profilin plus QCDC compared with the profilin-only or QCDC-only groups.

CASD1 has been described as a sialate-O-acetyltransferase and has been shown to be essential for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in some cell lines in vitro. In this study, we used knockout mice to confirm that CASD1 is indeed responsible for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in vivo. We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4+ T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, red blood cells from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on red blood cells was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development TER-119+ Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase, while TER-119+ Ery-C stage cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. These results suggest that throughout murine erythrocyte development, cells of the erythroid lineage express a glycoconjugate bearing a modified 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid, that is recognized specifically by the bovine coronavirus lectin and not by the influenza C hemagglutinin, and this modified sialic acid moiety is a component of the TER-119 epitope. As erythrocytes mature, the surface of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquires a distinct CASD1-dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus that are specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid.","output":"Alterations in sialic-acid O-acetylation glycoforms during murine erythrocyte development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Updates from the European Medicines Agency The European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a direct to healthcare professional communication for Vaxzevria (previously COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca), a plain-language description of medical terms related to medicines use and communications advising against the use of ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 outside randomised clinical trials and on the precautionary marketing suspension of the thalassaemia medicine Zynteglo.

In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 m. Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143). When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7); after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6). The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042). The average number of particles expelled per cough varied widely from patient to patient, ranging from 900 to 302,200 particles/cough while subjects had influenza and 1100 to 308,600 particles/cough after recovery. When the subjects had influenza, an average of 63% of each subject's cough aerosol particle volume in the detection range was in the respirable size fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person. This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.

This paper traces the cross-country associations between COVID-19 mortality, policy interventions aimed at limiting social contact, and their interactions with institutional and demographic characteristics. We document that, with a lag, more stringent pandemic policies were associated with lower mortality growth rates. The association between stricter pandemic policies and lower future mortality growth is more pronounced in countries with a greater proportion of the elderly population and urban population, greater democratic freedoms, and larger international travel flows. Countries with greater policy stringency in place prior to the first death realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower durations to the first mortality peak. In contrast, countries with higher initial mobility saw higher peak mortality rates in the first phase of the pandemic, and countries with a larger elderly population, a greater share of employees in vulnerable occupations, and a higher level of democracy took longer to reach their peak mortalities. Our results suggest that policy interventions are effective at slowing the geometric pattern of mortality growth, reducing the peak mortality, and shortening the duration to the first peak.

MethodThis was a hospital record based comparative study of baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters of the first and second wave of COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Uttarakhand, India. The study included all deceased patients admitted to the hospital during the first and second wave of COVID-19, i.e., between March 2020 to January 2021 and between March 2021 to June 2021, respectively. ResultThe study showed that there were more casualties in the second wave compared to the first, 475 (19.8%) and 424 (24.1%) respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of age. A male preponderance of mortality was evident in both the waves. The median duration of hospital stay was 5 (3-10) days in the second wave, which is significantly different from the corresponding duration in first wave (p<o.ooo).

Aim of this study was aim to examine the relationship between frailty and 1-year mortality in older patients with and without COVID-19, hospitalized and non-hospitalized. Design Cohort study Setting and Participants Patients 75+ accessing the Emergency Departments (ED) were identified from the ED archives in [location]. Methods Vulnerability status was estimated with the Dynamic Silver Code (DSC). COVID-19 hospital discharges (HC+) were compared to non-COVID-19 discharges (HC-). Linkage with a national COVID-19 registry identified non-hospitalized ED visitors with (NHC+) or without COVID-19 (NHC-). Results In 1 year, 48.4% and 33.9% of 1,745 HC+ and 15,846 HC- participants died (p<0.001). Mortality increased from 27.5% to 64.0% in HC+ and from 19.9% to 51.1% in HC- across DSC classes I to IV, with HC+ vs. HC- hazard ratios (HR) between 1.6 and 2.2.

Conclusions and Implications In hospitalized older subjects, mortality increases with vulnerability similarly in the presence and in the absence of COVID-19. In non-hospitalized patients, vulnerability-associated excess mortality is milder in subjects with than in those without COVID-19. The disease reduces survival even when background risk is low.

Lung tissues were obtained from lung cancer patients with or without COPD who underwent lobotomy and the levels of miR-21, TGF-/Smad signaling molecules, RORT, and other Th17-related cytokines were detected. Mouse COPD models were built by exposing both wild-type (WT) and miR-21-/- mice to cigarette smoke (CS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection.

METHODS: Imaging volumes and workflows for 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. Information was collected from the hospital data warehouse and evaluated using a business analytics software, aggregated both per week and per quarter, stratified by patient service location (emergency department, inpatients, outpatients) and imaging modality. For emergency radiology subunit, radiologist workload, machine workload, and turnaround times (TATs) were also analyzed. RESULTS: Total imaging volume in 2020 decreased by 21.5% compared to that in 2019 (p < .001); CT in outpatients increased by 11.7% (p < .005). Median global TAT and median code-blue global TAT were not statistically significantly different between 2019 and 2020 and between the first and the second pandemic waves in 2020 (all p > .09).

The highest correlations of the term 'RKI' with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of - 2 and - 12 days, meaning web searches were already performed from 2 to 12 days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term 'corona'. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on 'protective mask' were performed from 6 to 12 days after the peak of cases.

In COVID-19, disruption of the EC barrier results in edema, vascular inflammation, and coagulation, the hallmarks of the severe disease. However, the mechanisms by which EC are dysregulated in COVID-19 are unclear. Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin 51 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein EC with whole spike, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-B and enhanced the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM1, the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes, and the permeability of the monolayer. Inhibitors of integrin 51 activation prevented these effects. We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin 51 in EC to activate Rho GTPases, eNOS pathways, and the NF-B gene expression program responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration, respectively. These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin 51 as a promising target for treating vascular inflammation in COVID-19.","output":"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 induces endothelial inflammation through integrin 51 and NF-B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Novel angiographic grading scales for the assessment of intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents have been recently developed because previous angiographic grading scales cannot be applied to these aneurysms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Multiple raters (n = 31) from the disciplines of neuroradiology and neurosurgery were presented with pre- and posttreatment angiographic images of 14 aneurysms treated with intraluminal flow diverters. Raters were asked to classify pre- and posttreatment angiograms by using the OKM grading scale. Statistical analyses were subsequently performed with calculation of a generalized multirater  statistic for assessment of inter- and intraobserver variability and by performing a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for assessment of group differences. RESULTS Variability analysis of the OKM grading scale yielded substantial ( = 0.74) and almost perfect ( = 0.99) inter- and intraobserver agreement, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between raters with a background of neuroradiology versus neurosurgery or attending physician versus trainee.

Compared to previous reported SARS-COV2 associated GBS-MFS, in our case neurological symptoms came first, with para-infectious rather than post-infectious immune mediated mechanism. Latency of not SARS-COV2 triggered relapses was longer (median 7 years) with usually positive anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GBS-MFS recurrence description during SARS-COV2 infection. Its underlying immune mechanism seems to differ from SARS-COV2 related monophasic reports, with shorter latency and probably different antibody profile than not-SARS-COV2 linked relapses.","output":"Guillain Barr- Miller fisher syndrome relapse during SARS-CoV2 infection - A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19, horseracing was required to cease all activity in March 2020;however, little is known about the pandemic's impact on staff working practices This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on staff working practices during the initial lockdown phases An online survey about working conditions during lockdown was answered by 287 participants Chi-squared tests for independence and binary logistic regression (BLR) analysis was undertaken A total of 53 7% (n = 154) of staff were working during lockdown Pandemic-specific workplace changes were reported as effective by 87 8% (n = 115) of staff Flat grooms reported workplace changes as less effective (chi2 (52, n = 131) = 92 996, p 2 (52, n = 287) = 75 653, p &lt; 0 05) The findings suggest that most of the racing industry positively received changes made by their employers to tackle the pandemic, and for staff still working during lockdown, their health and safety was prioritised Continued development of employee support structures to promote job security and workforce stability is advised, which will minimise the disruption of staff changes on the care and welfare of the horses","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on staff working practices in UK horseracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries have adopted lengthy lockdown measures to mitigate the spreading of the COVID-19 virus.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 11,123 participants. The degree of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-items Generalized Anxiety disorder, and the 7-items Insomnia Severity Index. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 11,123 individuals out of a total of 15,008 contacts. 7315 (65.8%) were women, and 7182 (64.6%) were aged 18 to 34. A significant proportion of respondents experienced depression (5894 [53%]), anxiety (5544 [49.8%]), and insomnia (4410 [39.6%]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being married, and being a parent of children aged less than five years were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety (e.g. severe depression among women vs. men (OR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.06C1.33; P = .003), severe depression among married compared to unmarried respondents (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.71C2.16; P < .000), e.g. severe anxiety among women vs. men (OR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.24C1.58; <0.000), severe anxiety among married people compared to unmarried (OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.00C1.28; P < .003).

Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis. Findings Goggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache. Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19.

The safety climate in a workplace is a good indicator of safety performance because it captures employees attitudes and perceptions of safety at a specific point in time. The safety climate in the equine sector is a relatively unexplored area, though research could be a fruitful approach to improving occupational safety. In this study, the safety climates at six Swedish riding schools and six trotting stables were assessed using a questionnaire on the safety climates at these workplaces and complementary interviews. The riding schools and trotting stables all had favourable safety climates and employees were well-aware of the injury risks in their work environment. The main aspect of the workplace safety climate identified as needing improvement was the workers prioritisation and non-acceptance of risk, and their propensity to take calculated risks. Minor injuries were considered part of the job, indicating a need to communicate the importance of such injuries. This aspect of the equine safety climate should be targeted to improve future safety. The management should promote a culture of safety awareness at all levels of the organisation, making safety an integral part of daily work. Accident investigations should be performed systematically to learn from negative events, identify factors contributing to injuries and develop strategies for injury prevention. ABSTRACT: The Swedish equine sector is considered a high-risk work environment, with relatively high injury rates and high severity of injuries. General safety research has identified a correlation between the safety performance and safety culture, but little is known about the intricacies of the safety culture in the Swedish equine sector, especially concerning managers and employees perceptions of their work environment. The safety climate assessment is recognised as an effective tool for identifying potential problems in the workplace, thus enhancing safety behaviour and decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries. The aim was to evaluate the safety climate at riding schools and trotting stables through the Nordic Safety Climate Questionnaire (NOSACQ-50) diagnostic tool, and to get a better understanding of the workers perceptions regarding safety and safety management at their workplace through complementary interviews. The results showed that the safety climate was generally positive and that employees were aware of the risks relating to their work. Riding schools commonly had routines in place for risk assessment and work environment management, but such routines were often lacking at trotting stables, indicating inadequate prioritisation of safety by the management. The main area that should be targeted to improve safety in the sector is employees prioritisation and non-acceptance of risks. Proactive instead of reactive safety management should be promoted, where safety is an integral part of daily work and all employees are encouraged to identify factors contributing to occupational injuries and develop strategies for injury prevention.","output":"Occupational Safety Climate in the Swedish Equine Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has shown the potential to significantly affect the cardiovascular system.

METHODS: The observations of social distancing, daily deaths, infections along with the needed hospital resources for COVID-19 patient hospitalizations including the numbers of all hospital beds, beds needed in ICUs and infection wards, nursing staffs needed in ICUs and infection wards were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by the University of Washington. The observations of social distancing were based on the reduction in human contact relative to background levels for each location quantified by cell phone mobility data collected from IHME. The weighted data per 100,000 population gathered in a 40-day period of the first wave of the pandemic in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Statistical technique of panel data analysis is used to measure the associations between our social distancing and COVID-19 indicators in long-run. RESULTS: Results of dynamic long-run models confirm that a 1% rise in social distancing by reducing human contacts may decline daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, beds/nurses needed in ICUs and beds/nurses needed in infection wards due COVID-19 pandemic by 1.13%, 15.26%, 1.10%, 1.17% and 1.89%, respectively.

METHODS Retrospective time-series data from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and the Telehealth Ontario program from June 1, 2004, to March 31, 2006, were analyzed. The added value of Telehealth Ontario data was determined by comparing it temporally with NACRS data, which uses the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10-Canadian Enhancement coding system for discharge diagnoses. RESULTS Telehealth Ontario had 216,105 calls for respiratory complaints, while 819,832 ICD-coded complaints from NACRS were identified with a comparable diagnosis of respiratory illness. Telehealth Ontario call volume was heavily weighted for the 0-4 years age group (49%), while the NACRS visits were mainly from those 18-64 years old (44%). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.97, with the time-series analysis also resulting in significant correlations at lags (semi-monthly) 0 and 1, indicating that increases in Telehealth Ontario call volume correlate with increases in NACRS discharge diagnosis data for respiratory illnesses.

It is also the common cancer for which the largest advancements have been made in terms of screening, early diagnosis, management and treatment over the last decades. These advances have had an impact on breast cancer mortality, which therefore depends on many aspects, including countries income and the health care system, leading to inequalities across the world. Breast cancer mortality has been substantially decreasing in high income countries of North America and Australia, but trends have been less consistent in Latin America and Asia, indicating the scope for further global advancemets in screening and management of breast cancer. ABSTRACT: Substantial progress has been made in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of breast cancer over the last decades. This has affected mortality rates but has also led to inequality in epidemiological trends between different regions of the world. We extracted death certification data for breast cancer from the World Health Organization database. We analyzed trends in breast cancer mortality in selected countries from America, Asia, and Oceania over the 1980C2017 period and predicted numbers of deaths and rates for 2025. In North America, we observed decreased breast cancer mortality, reaching a rate of about 13/100,000 women in 2017. In Latin American countries, breast cancer mortality rates did not consistently decrease. The highest decreases in mortality were observed in Australia. Mortality trends in Asian countries remained among the lowest globally. We have predicted decreased mortality from breast cancer in 2025 for most of the analyzed countries. The epidemiological situation regarding breast cancer mortality is expected to change in the coming years. Advancements in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer must be extended in various areas of the world to obtain global control of breast cancer mortality.","output":"Breast Cancer Mortality in the Americas and Australasia over the Period 1980C2017 with Predictions for 2025"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this study, we investigated self-weighing frequency (SWF) among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and retrospectively (6 months) before the pandemic, and whether SWF was associated with changes in health-related behaviors.

Radioactivity of blood aliquotes was measured with a dose calibrator and labelling efficiency (LE%) was determined. The labelling purity was measured using a gamma counter and calculated using the formula: counts of pellet/counts of pellet+(counts of surnatant)*100.Training program was evaluated using a Learning Questionnaire (LQ). with a grading score from 6 (\\"\\") to 1 (\\"nothing\\") for each operator (n=3). RESULTS We didn't observed the presence of macroaggregates during the entire process, until the final sample. The labelling efficiency resulted at very high values in the three consecutive measured aliquotes (mean value 73.67%) as well as the labelling purity (>95.22%). In our instituion, we use splenic imaging with labelled heat-damaged RBCs to detect ectopic spleen, splenosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis. We performed 3 procedures with heat-damaged labeled RBCs with a mean labelling efficiency 73.67%.Training and learning programmes were scored by key objective areas with a mean value of 5. CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro labeling process of heat-damaged RBCs is simple and safe, providing a useful technique easy to implement in clinical routine for splenic imaging Learning outcome of the training programme was scored as effective by all the operators with evidence of high-efficiency-reproducible procedure mantained over time.","output":"Validation of in vitro labeling method for human use of heat-damage red blood cells to detect splenic tissue and hemocateretic function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the connectedness between the COVID-19 outbreak and major financial markets within a time-frequency framework Wavelet coherency analysis unveils perceptual differences between the short-term and longer-term markets reactions In the short-run, we find strong co-movements during the first and second waves of the pandemic During the first wave, longer-term investors were driven by the belief of future pandemic demise They make use of time diversification that results in positive returns The US being the new coronavirus epicenter, we also find that the US COVID-19 fear spills over into the international markets Gold, SSE, and cryptocurrencies seem safer investments","output":"COVID-19 pandemic waves and global financial markets: Evidence from wavelet coherence analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a serious autoimmune disease. The patient in an advanced state of the disease has restrained mobility and remains handicapped. It is therefore understandable that there is a great need for novel drugs and vaccines for the treatment of MS. Herein we summarise two major approaches applied for the treatment of the disease using peptide molecules alone or conjugated with mannan. The first approach focuses on selective myelin epitope peptide or peptide mimetic therapy alone or conjugated with mannan, and the second on immune-therapy by preventing or controlling disease through the release of appropriate cytokines. In both approaches the use of cyclic peptides offers the advantage of increased stability from proteolytic enzymes. In these approaches, the synthesis of myelin epitope peptides conjugated to mannan is of particular interest as this was found to protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, in prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. Protection was peptide-specific and associated with reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation. The aim of the studies of these peptide epitope analogs is to understand their molecular basis of interactions with human autoimmune T-cell receptor and a MS-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2b. This knowledge will lead the rational design to new beneficial non-peptide mimetic analogs for the treatment of MS. Some issues of the use of nanotechnology will also be addressed as a future trend to tackle the disease. We highlight novel immunomodulation and vaccine-based research against MS based on myelin epitope peptides and strategies developed in our laboratories.","output":"Novel Approaches in the Immunotherapy of Multiple Sclerosis: Cyclization of Myelin Epitope Peptides and Conjugation with Mannan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fluvoxamine is a well-tolerated, widely available, inexpensive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that has been shown in a small, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to prevent clinical deterioration of patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Fluvoxamine is also an agonist for the sigma-1 receptor, through which it controls inflammation We review here a body of literature that shows important mechanisms of action of fluvoxamine and other SSRIs that could play a role in COVID-19 treatment These effects include: reduction in platelet aggregation, decreased mast cell degranulation, interference with endolysosomal viral trafficking, regulation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha-driven inflammation and increased melatonin levels, which collectively have a direct antiviral effect, regulate coagulopathy or mitigate cytokine storm, which are known hallmarks of severe COVID-19","output":"Fluvoxamine: A Review of Its Mechanism of Action and Its Role in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internationalisation has so far been largely disconnected from major societal developments such as the rise of xenophobia, climate change or more recently the Corona crisis and research on internationalisation for society is scarce The article provides the definition of such internationalisation in higher education for society (IHES) as well as its characteristics developed in a mapping study for the German Academic Exchange Service and describes examples of IHES activities in universities around the world The author shows, that IHES as a special form of Internationalisation at Home (IaH) is still in its infant state, in contrast to classical internationalisation The article then connects IHES with the most important societal challenge of our time: Corona, outlining different kinds of IHES activities that could be developed to help people during the Corona crisis In a final excursion, the current movement towards online education as an answer to the Corona crisis is reflected upon from an IHES perspectives and possible applications are suggested Alternate abstract:Internacionalizace je zatm ve velk m?e odpojena od zsadnch aspekt? spole?enskho vyvoje, jako je zvy?ujc se xenofobie, klimatick zmny nebo v posledn dob i krize okolo koronaviru Vyzkumy internacionalizace pro spole?nost se p?itom provd jen velmi z?dka Tento ?lnek poskytuje definici takovto internacionalizace ve vym vzdlvn pro spole?nost (IHES) i jej vlastnosti odhalen v mapovac studii pro Nmeck slu?by akademick vymny a popisuje p?klady aktivit IHES na univerzitch v r?znych ?stech svta Autor ukazuje, ?e IHES jako speciln forma domc internacionalizace (Internationalisation at Home - IaH) je v porovnn s klasickou internacionalizac stle je?t v plenkch ?lnek spojuje IHES s nejvyznamnj? spole?enskou vyzvou na? doby - koronavirem - a na?rtv r?zn druhy aktivit IHES, kter by mohly byt na pomoc lidem bhem koronavirov krize vyvinuty V zvre?nm zhodnocen problematiky je provedena reflexe aktulnho posunu smrem k online vzdlvn jako odpovdi na koronavirovou krizi z perspektivy IHES a jsou navr?ena mo?n vyu?it","output":"Internationalisation in higher education for society C IHES in the times of corona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mark the 25th anniversary of The American Journal of Managed Care (R) (AJMC (R)), each issue in 2020 will include a special feature: an interview with a thought leader in the world of health care and medicine The June issue features a conversation with Donald M Berwick, MD, MPP, president emeritus and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of CMS","output":"Hopes, Worries for US Health Care in Wake of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a crisis that affects several aspects of people's lives around the globe.

Using clinical data from the electronic health record among a national cohort of patients initially diagnosed with pneumonia, we examined temporal trends in severity of illness, hospitalization, and short- and long-term deaths. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort PARTICIPANTS: All patients >18 years presenting to emergency departments (EDs) at 118 VA Medical Centers between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2016 with an initial clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and confirmed by chest imaging report. EXPOSURES: Year of encounter. MAIN MEASURES: Hospitalization and 30-day and 90-day mortality. Illness severity was defined as the probability of each outcome predicted by machine learning predictive models using age, sex, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory data from encounters during years 2006C2007, and similar models trained on encounters from years 2015 to 2016. We estimated the changes in hospitalizations and 30-day and 90-day mortality between the first and the last 2 years of the study period accounted for by illness severity using time covariate decompositions with model estimates. RESULTS: Among 196,899 encounters across the study period, hospitalization decreased from 71 to 63%, 30-day mortality 10 to 7%, 90-day mortality 16 to 12%, and 1-year mortality 29 to 24%. Comorbidity risk increased, but illness severity decreased.

Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25(th) to the 75(th) percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus.

Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and lymphocytopenia (20-40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low.

The implementation of a Closed Loop Medication Administration solution aims to reduce medication administration errors and prevent patient harm. AIM: We conducted the first evaluation to assess the impact of a novel optical medication scanning device, MedEye, on the rate of medication administration errors in solid oral dosage forms. METHODS: We performed a before and after study on one ward at a tertiary-care teaching hospital that used a commercial electronic prescribing and medication administration system and was implementing MedEye (a bedside tool for stopping and preventing medication administration errors). Pre-MedEye data collection occurred between Aug-Nov 2019 and post-MedEye data collection occurred between Feb-Mar 2020. We conducted direct observations of nursing drug administration rounds before and after the MedEye implementation. Observers recorded what they observed being administered (e.g., drug name, form, strength and quantity) and compared this to what was prescribed. Errors were classified as either a timing error, omission error or other error. We calculated the rate and type of medication administration errors (MAEs) before and after the MedEye implementation. A sample size calculation suggested that approximately 10,000 medication administrations were needed. Data collection was reduced due to the COVID 19 pandemic and implementation delays. RESULTS: Trained pharmacists or nurses observed a total of 1,069 administrations of solid oral dosage forms before and 432 after the MedEye intervention was implemented. The percentage of MAEs pre-MedEye (69.1%) and post-MedEye (69.9%) remained almost the same. Non-timing errors (combination of omission + other errors) reduced from 51 (4.77%) to 11 (2.55%), which had borderline significance (p=0.05) however after adjusting for confounders, significance was lost. We also saw a non-significant reduction in other error types (e.g., dose and documentation errors) following the implementation of MedEye from 34 (3.2%) to 7 (1.62%). An observer witnessed a nurse dispense the wrong medication (prednisolone) instead of the intended medication (furosemide) in the post-MedEye period. After receiving a notification from MedEye that an unexpected medication had been dispensed, the nurse corrected the dose thus preventing an error. We also identified one instance where the nurse correctly dispensed a prescribed medication (amlodipine) but this was mistakenly identified by the MedEye scanner as another prescribed medication (metoclopramide). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation of a novel optical medication scanning device, MedEye on the rate of MAEs in one of the largest NHS trusts in England. We found a non-statistically significant reduction in non-timing error rates. This was notable because incidents within this category e.g., dose errors, are more likely to be associated with harm compared to timing errors.(2) However, further research is needed to investigate the impact of MedEye on a larger sample size and range of medications.

We examined (1) the prevalence of positive screens for falls, cognitive impairment, and activities of daily living (ADL) impairment, (2) referrals/orders generated potentially in response, and (3) the increase in ACP among those with two AWVs. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, we used electronic medical record data from a Mid-Atlantic group ambulatory practice. We included adults age > 65 who had 1 AWV (n = 16,176) in years 2014-2017. Analyses on high-risk prescribing were limited to those (n = 13,537) with 3 months of follow up and ACP to those (n = 9097) with two AWVs. We used responses from the AWV health risk questionnaire to identify screening status for falls, cognitive and ADL impairment and whether an older adult had an ACP. For each screen we identified orders/referrals placed potentially in response (e.g., physical therapy for falls). High-risk medications were based on the 2019 Beers Criteria. RESULTS Positive screening rates were 38% for falls, 23% for cognition, and 32% for ADL impairment. The adjusted odds of having an order placed potentially in response to the screening were 1.8 (95% CI 1.6-2.0) for falls, 1.4 (1.3-1.7) for cognition, 2.8 (2.4-3.3) for ADL impairment. The adjusted odds of a high-risk prescription in the 3 months after a positive screen were 2.1 (95% CI 1.8-2.5) for falls and 1.9 (95% CI 1.6-2.4) for cognition. Of those with two AWVs, 48% had an ACP at the first AWV. Among the remaining 52% with no ACP at the first AWV, the predicted probability of having an ACP at the second AWV was 0.22 (95% CI 0.18-0.25).

Since the onset of the pandemic, the focus of many healthcare systems has shifted toward limiting non-essential visits to the hospital in order to prioritize and allocate resources toward treating those affected by COVID-19. While the effect of COVID-19 has been felt amongst many patient populations, those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have been particularly impacted. We aimed to determine how changes to the provision of IBD care due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected IBD patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in patients with an IBD diagnosis comparing patients admitted to two tertiary care centres affiliated with Western University in London, Canada between March 17 and August 31 2019 (2019 cohort or pre-pandemic), to patients admitted between March 17 and August 31 2020 (2020 cohort or pandemic). Patients were reviewed to assess any differences in care utilization and IBD-related outcomes such as hospitalization, need for surgery, length of stay in hospital and in-patient drug therapy during the defined time periods. RESULTS: A total of 863 patients were reviewed in 2019, and 554 in 2020. Of those, 184 (CD, n= 125; UC, n= 59) and 172 (CD, n= 109; UC, n= 62) encounters met the inclusion criteria for 2019 and 2020 respectively. Patient demographics were similar between 2019 and 2020 cohort with the exception of age (2019, mean age = 44.76 years  16.78; 2020, mean age=50.36 years  17.82, p=0.002). The length of stay in hospital was shorter in 2020 (6.88 days vs 9.63, p=0.045). Significantly fewer patients were initiated on Infliximab in hospital in 2020 (2020, 3.50 per month; 2019, 6.83 per month, p=0.001). Fewer in-patient surgeries were performed in 2020 (2019, 76; 2020, 57; p=0.112). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data demonstrate during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a significant reduction in the length of stay for patients with IBD as well as fewer patients initiated on infliximab while in hospital. There was also a decrease in the number of surgeries performed in 2020. These differences may reflect an effort to minimize contact between patients and health care facilities as well as reduce the introduction of further immunosuppression. Further research will be to determine whether if more ER visits became hospitalizations and any delays in appointment times or endoscopies, or compliance issues with medications may have led to these aforementioned outcomes.","output":"P620 Pivoting in a pandemic: The impact of COVID-19 on the provision of care for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease C A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are in the midst of quantum hype with some excessive claims of quantum computing potential, many vendors' and even some research organizations' exaggerations, and a funding frenzy for very low technology readiness level startups.

RESULTS: Novel data revealed interesting facts on the spreading of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the data showed that the number of COVID-19 positive cases increases due to the decrease of temperature or humidity, whereas an average decrease in the wind speed was also found to be associated with an elevation of the number of positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study determined the impact meteorological factors on the infectivity rate of COVID-19. An inverse association was found between the meteorological parameters with the spreading of COIVD-19. Therefore, this study directs the health authorities to implement specific measures against the spreading of this global pandemic based on weather patterns.","output":"Impact of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 pandemic: A comprehensive study from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study explored the relationship of ER expression levels with HER2 staining properties and heterogeneity and discussed the differences in HER2 assessment caused by the 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline updates from that of the 2013 version. METHODS HER2-positive breast cancer was divided into three groups of the high hormone receptor expression (LH-high) group, low expression (LH-low) group, or negative (NLH) group to (1) compare differences in the percentage of the HER2 IHC test score of 2 + based on the 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline and in the intratumor heterogeneity of HER2 expression for breast cancer with an IHC score of 3 + among these groups, (2) compare the HER2/CEP17 ratio and the average HER2 copy number, and classified ISH groupings according to the 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline algorithm. RESULTS (1) Of 244 HER2-positive breast cancers, the cases with a HER2 IHC score of 2 + (n = 54, 22.1%) were significantly more common in the LH-high group (n = 45, P < 0.001). The frequency of heterogeneity was low (n = 25, 10.2%) for the HER2 score of 3 + (n = 190, 77.9%), and significantly higher in the LH-high group (n = 19, 76%, P = 0.002). (2) In a HER2 IHC score of 2 + , Group 2 which is deemed HER2 negative according to the revised 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline was observed in 17 (39.5%) out of 43 cases, of which 16 cases (94.1%) were in the LH-high group.

We sought to introduce a modified prostate health index density (mPHI) model using imaging indicators and to compare its diagnostic performance for early detection of occult onset csPCa within the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gray zone with that of PHI and PHID. METHODS AND PARTICIPATION: Between August 2020 and January 2022, a training cohort of 278 patients (total PSA 4.0C10.0 ng/ml) who were scheduled for a prostate biopsy were prospectively recruited. PHI and PHID were compared with mPHI [Formula: see text] for the diagnosis performance in identifying csPCa. Pathology outcomes from systematic prostate biopsies were considered the gold standard. RESULTS: This model was tested in a training cohort consisting of 73 csPCa, 14 non-clinically significant prostate cancer(non-csPCa), and 191 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples. In the univariate analysis for the PSA gray zone cohort, for overall PCa, the AUC of mPHI (0.856) was higher than PHI (0.774) and PHID (0.835). For csPCa, the AUC of mPHI (0.859) also surpassed PHI (0.787) and PHID (0.825). For detection of csPCa, compared with lower specificities from PHI and PHID, mPHI performed the highest specificity (76.5%), by sparing 60.0% of unnecessary biopsies at the cost of missing 11 cases of csPCa. The mPHI outperformed PHI and PHID for overall PCa detection. In terms of csPCa, mPHI exceeds diagnostic performance with a better net benefit in decision curve analysis (DCA) compared with PHI or PHID. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a modified PHI density (mPHI) model that can sensitively distinguish early-stage csPCa patients within the PSA gray zone.

However, approximately 5% of them were critically ill and require intensive care unit admission for advanced life supports. Patients in the intensive care unit were high risk for venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage due to the immobility and anticoagulants used during advanced life supports. The aim of the study was to report the incidence and treatments of the two complications in such patients. Method: Patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and patients with community-acquired pneumonia (Group 2) that required intensive care unit admission were enrolled in this retrospective study. Their demographics, laboratory results, ultrasound findings and complications such as venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were collected and compared. Results: Thirty-four patients with COVID-19 and 51 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included. The mean ages were 66 and 63 years in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Venous thromboembolism was detected in 6 (18%) patients with COVID-19 and 18 (35%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia (P = 0.09). The major type was distal deep venous thrombosis. Twenty-one bleeding events occurred in 12 (35%) patients with COVID-19 and 5 bleeding events occurred in 5 (10%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia, respectively (P = 0.01). Gastrointestinal system was the most common source of bleeding. With the exception of one death due to intracranial bleeding, blood transfusion with or without surgical/endoscopic treatments was able to manage the bleeding in the remaining patients.

However, isolation may affect negatively the psychological well-being and impair sleep quality. Our aim was to evaluate the sleep quality of respiratory patients during the covid-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: All patients who underwent a telemedicine appointment from March 30 to April 30 of 2020 were asked to participate in the survey. Sleep difficulties were measured using Jenkins Sleep Scale. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 365 patients (mean age 63.9 years, 55.6% male, 50.1% with sleep-disordered breathing [SDB]). During the lockdown, 78.9% of participants were confined at home without working. Most patients (69.6%) reported at least one sleep difficulty and frequent awakenings was the most prevalent problem. Reporting at least one sleep difficulty was associated with home confinement without working, female gender and diagnosed or suspected SDB, after adjustment for cohabitation status and use of anxiolytics. Home confinement without working was associated with difficulties falling asleep and waking up too early in the morning. Older age was a protective factor for difficulties falling asleep, waking up too early and non-restorative sleep. Interestingly, SDB patients with good compliance to positive airway pressure therapy were less likely to report sleep difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement without working, female gender and SDB may predict a higher risk of reporting sleep difficulties.

Our primary outcomes consisted of: (1) specimen collection within 1 day of symptom onset (test seeking), (2) test result reported to local public health within 1 day of specimen collection (test turnaround), and (3) entry of case data into the provincial database within 1 day of reporting test results (reporting). We examined 14 covariates including eight case characteristics, and six neighborhood characteristics. In addition to descriptive measures, logistic regression models were fitted. Unadjusted models included the covariate alone, while adjusted models included age, gender, month, and region. Findings Among 27,198 COVID-19 cases from January 25 2020 to July 19 2020, 28.7% had timely test seeking, 40.2% had timely test turnaround, and 75.5% had timely reporting. Male gender had lower odds of timely test seeking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74-0.85]) compared to females.

RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases were identified through PubMed bibliographic database searches, and final analyses were conducted on 70 adults and ten neonatal patients with GI mucormycosis. Asia had the highest number of reported cases, with 46 (57.5%). Neonatal cases had a mortality rate of 70%, while other cases had a mortality rate of 44%. Corticosteroid therapy and diabetes were the most significant risk factors in patients, while 11% were immunocompetent with no apparent underlying condition. COVID-19 positivity was detected in four adult patients. Moreover, neonatal cases included premature and low-weight infants, metabolic acidosis, and malnutrition. Abdominal pain, fever, and GI perforation were the most common signs of infection, while vomiting occurred in 40% of neonatal cases.

This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument for exploring how medical students learn in an undergraduate medical program that employs a blended learning approach. METHOD: Using Artinos seven step approach, we developed a questionnaire to investigate how medical students learn in a blended learning environment. For pilot testing, 120 students completed this 19-item questionnaire. These 19-items were evaluated for construct and convergent validity across an expert medical education panel. Further item testing was analysed with principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation for item reduction and factor estimation. Hence, validity was thoroughly addressed to ensure the questionnaire was representative of the key focus questions. Cronbachs Alpha was used for item reliability testing, and Spearmans Rho was used for the correlation between the questionnaire items and the extensively used MSLQ. Hence, validity and reliability were systematically addressed.

The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P < .001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion.

However, the impact caused by airflow characteristic under stratum ventilation on the thermal performance and indoor comfort is noteworthy due to its supply air outlets are close to the occupied zone. It is widely known that parallel turbulent jets are important for the flow structure and air distribution. Hence, an optimum parallel jet spacing (PJS) between two jet centerlines can obviously enhance the fluid interaction and indoor thermal comfort with low energy consumption. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of the PJS on the performance of multi-jet stratum ventilation. A validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to conduct the year-round multivariate analysis. A total of eight PJSs, four inlet locations and five climate zones were discussed synthetically. Air distribution performance index (ADPI), ventilation effectiveness (E(t)) and economic comfort coefficient were employed as the evaluation indicators to assess the thermal comfort and energy efficiency in various scenarios. Research results indicated that the PJS showed different influences on the indoor thermal comfort and energy utilization efficiency as a result of cooperative effect including energy dissipation, air short-circuit probability, air distribution uniformity and airflow path. Combining with building energy simulation method, the optimum PJSs of stratum ventilation with different air inlet positions in five climate zones were obtained, which can help provide a comfortable indoor thermal environment and improve energy efficiency in a low-cost way. The data and conclusions presented in this study can supplement the theoretical basis for the actual applications of multiple-jet stratum ventilation used in an office.","output":"Study on the impact of parallel jet spacing on the performance of multi-jet stratum ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropsychiatric manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been increasingly recognized. However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the central nervous system remains unclear. Brain organoid models derived from human pluripotent stem cells are potentially useful for the study of complex physiological and pathological processes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as they recapitulate cellular heterogeneity and function of individual tissues. We identified brain organoid studies that provided insight into the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect neurons, the extent of neurotropism was relatively limited. Conversely, choroidal epithelial cells consistently showed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain organoid studies also elucidated potential mechanism for cellular entry, demonstrated viral replication, and highlighted downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, they suggest that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 may be contributed by both direct neuronal invasion and indirect consequences of neuroinflammation. The use of high throughput evaluation, patient-derived organoids, and advent of \\"assembloids\\" will provide a better understanding and functional characterization of the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 inside humans is through lung tissues with a pH of 7.38C7.42. A two-dimensional structure of k-21 was drawn using the 2D-sketcher of Maestro 12.2 and trimmed of C18 alkyl chains from all four arms with the assumption that the core moiety k-21 was without C18. The immunogenic potential of k21/QA was conducted using the C-ImmSim server for a position-specific scoring matrix analyzing the human host immune system response. Therapeutic probability was shown using prediction models with negative and positive control drugs. Negative scores show that the binding of a quaternary ammonium compound with the spike proteins binding site is favorable. The drug molecule has a large Root Mean Square Deviation fluctuation due to the less complex geometry of the drug molecule, which is suggestive of a profound impact on the regular geometry of a viral protein. There is high concentration of Immunoglobulin M/Immunoglobulin G, which is concomitant of virus reduction.

The observed waning of vaccine efficacy over time suggests that booster doses may be required to maintain population immunity especially in the most vulnerable groups. Here, using data and models for England, we consider the dynamics of COVID-19 over a two-year time-frame, and the role that booster vaccinations can play in mitigating the worst effects. We find that boosters are necessary to suppress the imminent wave of infections that would be generated by waning vaccine efficacy. Projecting further into the future, the optimal deployment of boosters is highly sensitive to their long-term action. If protection from boosters wanes slowly (akin to protection following infection) then a single booster dose to the over 50s may be all that is needed over the next two-years. However, if protection wanes more rapidly (akin to protection following second dose vaccination) then annual or even biannual boosters are required to limit subsequent epidemic peaks an reduce the pressure on public health services.","output":"Waning, Boosting and a Path to Endemicity for SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: As of 2020, less than 5% of physicians in the United States have a drug enforcement administration-X waiver to prescribe buprenorphine.

To cope with such an outbreak, the identification of infected individuals with high accuracy is vital. qRT-PCR plays a key role in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The N protein-coding region is widely analyzed in qRT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Japan. We recently encountered two cases of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens showing atypical amplification curves in the qRT-PCR. We performed whole-genome sequencing and found that the virus was a Delta-type variant of SARS-CoV-2 with a single nucleotide mutation in the probe-binding site. To evaluate the extent of spread of the variant in the area, we performed whole viral genome sequencing of samples collected from 61 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the same time and in the same area. There were no other cases with the same mutation, indicating that the variant had not spread in the area. Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic analysis with various SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in the public database. Hundreds of variants were reported globally, and one in Japan were found to contain the same mutation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the variant was very close to other Delta variants endemic in Japan but quite far from the variants containing the same mutation reported from outside Japan, suggesting that the variant would have been sporadically generated in some domestic areas. These findings propose two key points: i) mutations in the region used for SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR can cause abnormal amplification curves; therefore, the qRT-PCR result should not just be judged in an automated manner, but also manually checked by the examiner to prevent false-negative results, and ii) various mutations can be generated sporadically and unpredictably; therefore, efficient and robust screening systems are needed to promptly monitor the emergence of de novo variants.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Containing Mutation in the Probe Binding Region Used for qRT-PCR Test in Japan Exhibited Atypical PCR Amplification and Might Induce False Negative Result"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Obesity is frequent in Mexico, but its importance for COVID-19 is still under debate We aimed to describe its frequency in patients with severe COVID-19 in a referral hospital Materials and methods: 167 patients hospitalized for suspicious or confirmed COVID-19, 66 7% male with a median age of 54 (interquartile range 43-63) were classified according to BMI and evaluated for comorbidities, coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test results, and reason for discharge Results: 75 3% of the patients were overweight or obese and 7 8% had grade III obesity Increasing BMI related to higher probabilities of hyperglycemia (fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL, p = 0 044), but other comorbidities were similar among groups The mortality rate among patients with Grade I obesity was 11%, whereas 33% of patients with either underweight or Grade III obesity died, depicting a U-shaped mortality curve Conclusions: Obesity and its comorbidities are common in hospitalized patients in Mexico Special efforts must be made to detect them, and further interventions to control the obesity pandemic will also be necessary to improve long-term results Antecedentes: la obesidad severa es frecuente en Mxico, pero su impacto en el COVID-19 es debatida Buscamos describir su frecuencia en pacientes con COVID-19 severo en un hospital de referencia Material y mtodos: 167 pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19 (sospechoso o confirmado), 66 7% hombres con una mediana de edad de 54 a?os (rangos intercuartlicos 43-63) se clasificaron de acuerdo al IMC, sus comorbilidades, la prueba de reaccin de polimerasa para coronavirus-2 y causa de egreso Resultados: 75 3% tenan sobrepeso u obesidad y 7 8% estaban en obesidad grado III El aumento de IMC se relacion con mayor probabilidad de hiperglucemia (glucosa en ayuno &gt; 100 mg/dL, p=0 044), otras comorbilidades fueron similares entre grupos La portalidad en pacientes con obesidad grado I fue 11% y 33% en peso bajo u obesidad grado III, mostrando una curva con forma de U Conclusiones: La obesidad y sus comorbilidades son comunes en pacientes hospitalizados en Mxico Se deben hacer esfuerzos especiales por detectarlas y se necesitarn intervenciones sobre la pandemia de obesidad para mejorar resultados a largo plazo","output":"The tale of two pandemics: High prevalence of severe obesity among patients with suspected COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease has given rise to a new disease whose boundaries are still to be discovered.

This led to a concern that loneliness may increase, facilitating poorer mental and physical health. Twenty qualitative interviews were conducted, with a diverse group of UK-based men, between January and March 2021, during severe restrictions. Our aim was to generate new insights into mens experience of loneliness during the pandemic, and consider the ramifications of these for continued/future restrictions, the easing of restrictions, and the future beyond the pandemic. Thematic analysis, focused on semantic themes, was employed as part of a grounded epistemology whereby the stated perspectives of the interviewees drove the content of the study. Six themes were constructed: i) people to see and things to do (broken, changed, and new); ii) rethought and renewed recognition of what is important; iii) loneliness with a purpose; iv) loneliness as normal; v) anxiety of social contact; and vi) easier for some than others. The restrictions did cause some loneliness, particularly because of lost routines and opportunities, and the reduction in face-to-face interaction.

Drawing on Lefebvrian rhythmanalysis and aspects of time-geography, we consider how workers and their loved ones negotiate changes in space-time patterns across careers in industrial construction, especially work at projects tied to resource development and extraction. Data are derived from in-depth career history interviews conducted with workers in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador between 2014 and 2018. Three career path cases illustrate mobile rhythms of differently positioned workers from their entry into construction to their career stage at the point of the interview, ranging from apprenticeship through mid-career journeyed to retirement. These workers pursue training and jobs involving variable mobilities between home and work across shifting locations. We contribute to recent efforts to highlight the compatibility of rhythmanalysis with an expanded, feminist, biographical approach to time-geography, and the applicability of such an approach for the applied study of mobilities. We also respond to recent calls to study experiences of rhythmic change in the lives of mobile and migrant workers. Findings reveal that changes in mobile rhythms may be small and incremental, as in the case of schedule or rotation adjustments, or sweeping and large scale, as in the case of shifts from working locally to working in distant locations amidst the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS The estimated number of serious fungal infection was estimated to be between 178,772 and 179,624 with nearly 2,300 cases of these representing opportunistic infections in people living with HIV. The incidence of histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis in people living with HIV is high and estimated to be 4.3 and 4.6 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. Approximately 12,247-13,099 cases of aspergillosis and 164,227 of other serious fungal infections were estimated to occur each year. CONCLUSION An accurate estimate of the burden of serious fungal infections in Honduras is unknown but based on our results, likely significant. Serious fungal infections represent an important public health problem in Honduras affecting approximately 1.8% of the population. There is a clear need for better access to diagnostic tools and antifungals to conduct research to better understand the impact of fungal diseases in Honduras.","output":"Burden of Serious Fungal Infections in Honduras."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As existing vaccines fail to completely prevent COVID-19 infections or community transmission, there is an unmet need for vaccines that can better combat SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). We previously developed highly thermo-tolerant monomeric and trimeric receptor-binding domain derivatives that can withstand 100 C for 90 min and 37 C for four weeks and help eliminate cold-chain requirements. We show that mice immunised with these vaccine formulations elicit high titres of antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants VIC31 (with Spike: D614G mutation), Delta and Omicron (BA.1.1) VOC. Compared to VIC31, there was an average 14.4-fold reduction in neutralisation against BA.1.1 for the three monomeric antigen-adjuvant combinations and a 16.5-fold reduction for the three trimeric antigen-adjuvant combinations; the corresponding values against Delta were 2.5 and 3.0. Our findings suggest that monomeric formulations are suitable for upcoming Phase I human clinical trials and that there is potential for increasing the efficacy with vaccine matching to improve the responses against emerging variants. These findings are consistent with in silico modelling and AlphaFold predictions, which show that, while oligomeric presentation can be generally beneficial, it can make important epitopes inaccessible and also carries the risk of eliciting unwanted antibodies against the oligomerisation domain.","output":"Highly Thermotolerant SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Elicits Neutralising Antibodies against Delta and Omicron in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(A) Moderator Dr Dr Kung-Liahng Wang (Taiwan) and speaker Dr Se-Ik Kim from Korea Scientific program of the 6th ASGO International Workshop (Day 2, Room 603) Schedule Moderator Young Doctor Session (2) Dr Peng-Hui Wang Young Doctor Session (3) Dr Peng-Hui Wang ASGO, Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology this workshop in a hybrid meeting with 104 participants joining this meeting online from overseas Scientific program of the 6th ASGO International Workshop (Day 1, Room 603) Schedule Speaker B-1: Precision medicine B1-01 Precision medicine in gynecologic cancers Dr Shu-Jen Chen B1-02 Mechanism targeting homologous recombination deficiencies in ovarian cancer Dr Katsutoshi ODA B1-03 Biomarker and genetic testing for PARP inhibitor Dr Ya-Min Cheng B-2: Safety and QoL of Avastin in gynecological cancer (Industrial section) Dr Hung-Hsueh Chou SGO-ROC 10th Council meeting TAGO 9th Council meeting B-3: Evolving area of maintenance therapy in recurrent ovarian cancer (Industrial section)Dr 1/11 https://ejgo org OUTLOOK The 6th International Workshop of the Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology (ASGO) was held in the Chang Yung-Fa Foundation International Convention Center, Taipei, Taiwan, on 19th to 20th December 2020 [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of Gynecologic Oncology is the property of Korean Society of Gynecologic Oncology & Colposcopy and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The 6th International Workshop of the Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology, December 19th to 20th, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience in Myanmars response to Cyclone Nargis and to explore ways to improve resilience at the system level. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is an explanatory qualitative study exploring the institutional capacity of resilience in Myanmars health system. Analysis proceeded using a data-driven thematic analysis closely following the framework method. This process enabled comparisons and contrasts of key emergent themes between the participants, which later generated key results describing the foundational assets, barriers and opportunities for achieving resilience in Myanmar. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised of 12 in-depth interviews conducted with representatives from international organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The inclusion criteria to recruiting the participants were that they had directly been a part of the Cyclone Nargis response at the time. There was a balanced distribution of participants across UN, bilateral and NGOs, and most of them were either Myanmar citizens or expatriates with extensive working experience based in Myanmar. RESULTS: Key findings elucidate the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in Myanmars response to Cyclone Nargis. Strong social capital and motivation propelled by its deep-rooted culture and religion served as Myanmars greatest assets that filled major gaps in the system. Meanwhile, its postcolonial and military legacy posed barriers towards investing in building its long-term foundations towards resilience. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that resilience in the health system can be built through strategic investments towards building the foundations of resilience to better prepare for future shocks. In the case of Myanmar, social capital and motivation, which surfaced as its foundational assets, can be channelled into opportunities that can help achieve its long-term health goals, accelerating its journey towards resilience in the health system.","output":"Evidence of health system resilience in Myanmar during Cyclone Nargis: a qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite advances in online education during the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on surgical simulation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the costs and resources required to maintain simulation training in the pandemic and to evaluate how it affected exposure of medical students to simulation during their surgical clerkship. METHODS The number of learners, contact hours, staff hours, and costs were collected from a multi-departmental simulation center of a single academic institution in a retrospective fashion. Utilization and expenditure metrics were compared between the first quarter of academic years 2018-2020. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate potential differences between overall resource utilization before and during the pandemic, and subgroup analysis was performed for the resources required for the training of the third-year medical students. RESULTS The overall number of learners and contact hours decreased during the first quarter of the academic year 2020 in comparison with 2019 and 2018. However, the staff hours increased. In addition, the costs for PPE increased for the same periods of time. In the subgroup analysis of the third-year medical students, there was an increase in the number of learners, as well as in the staff hours and in the space required to perform the simulation training. DISCUSSION Despite an increase in costs and resources spent on surgical simulation during the pandemic, the utilization by academic entities has remained unaffected. Further studies are required to identify potential solutions to lower simulation resources without a negative impact on the quality of surgical simulation.","output":"The Resource Costs of Maintaining Learner Utilization of a Simulation Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the fast spread of COVID-19 is the cause of a sanitary emergency in Brazil.

The aim of this work is to show the changes in the ambulatory care practices by individualized telematic care for each patient profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48hours and considered very preferential.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five designated tertiary hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: We routinely collected medical data of 1364 confirmed adult patients with COVID-19 between 8 January and 19 March 2020. Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers' D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model. Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The prediction models showed good model performance in identifying patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of death in 60 days. It may be useful for acute risk classification.

The recent unprecedented surge of CAM in India has drawn worldwide attention. More than 28,252 mucormycosis cases are counted and India is the first country where mucormycosis has been declared a notifiable disease. However, misconception of management, diagnosing and treating this infection continue to occur. Thus, European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) felt the need to address clinical management of CAM in low- and middle-income countries. This article provides a comprehensive document to help clinicians in managing this infection. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and inappropriate (high dose or not indicated) corticosteroid use are the major predisposing factors for this surge. High counts of Mucorales spores in both the indoor and outdoor environments, and the immunosuppressive impact of COVID-19 patients as well as immunotherapy are possible additional factors. Furthermore, a hyperglycaemic state leads to an increased expression of glucose regulated protein (GRP- 78) in endothelial cells that may help the entry of Mucorales into tissues. Rhino-orbital mucormycosis is the most common presentation followed by pulmonary mucormycosis. Recommendations are focused on the early suspicion of the disease and confirmation of diagnosis. Regarding management, glycaemic control, elimination of corticosteroid therapy, extensive surgical debridement and antifungal therapy are the standards for proper care. Due to limited availability of amphotericin B formulations during the present epidemic, alternative antifungal therapies are also discussed.","output":"ECMM/ISHAM recommendations for clinical management of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the flexural properties and surface characteristics of a structural colored resin composite after different finishing and polishing methods, in comparison to those of conventional resin composites. METHODS AND MATERIALS A structural color resin composite, Omnichroma (OM, Tokuyama Corp, Chiyoda City, Tokyo, Japan), and two comparison resin composites, Filtek Supreme Ultra (FS, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) and Tetric EvoCeram (TE, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), were used. The flexural properties of the resin composites were determined in accordance with the ISO 4049 specifications. For surface properties, 70 polymerized specimens of each resin composite were prepared and divided into seven groups of 10. Surface roughness (Sa), gloss (GU), and surface free energy (SFE) were investigated after the following finishing and polishing methods. Three groups of specimens were finished with a superfine-grit diamond bur (SFD), and three with a tungsten carbide bur (TCB). After finishing, one of the two remaining groups was polished with a one-step silicone point (CMP), and the other with an aluminum oxide flexible disk (SSD). A group ground with SiC 320-grit was set as a baseline. RESULTS The average flexural strength ranged from 116.6 to 142.3 MPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average E ranged from 6.8 to 13.2 GPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average R ranged from 0.77 to 1.01 MJ/mm3 in the following order: OM > FS > TE. The Sa values of the OM groups polished with CMP and SSD were found to be significantly lower than those of the other resin composites, regardless of the finishing method. The GU values appeared to be dependent on the material and the finishing method used. The OM specimens polished with SSD showed significantly higher GU values than those polished with CMP. Most of the resin composites polished with SSD demonstrated significantly higher S values compared to the other groups. Extremely strong negative correlations between Sa and GU in the combined data from the three resin composites and each resin composite and between Sa and S in the OM specimens were observed; GU showed a strong positive correlation with S in the same material. CONCLUSION These findings indicate that both flexural and surface properties are material dependent. Furthermore, the different finishing and polishing methods used in this study were observed to affect the Sa, GU, and SFE of the resin composites.","output":"Flexural Properties and Polished Surface Characteristics of a Structural Colored Resin Composite."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To demonstrate the rationale for and feasibility of tibial-pedal (TP) access as an alternative to trans-radial (TR) or trans-femoral (TF) access for uterine artery embolization (UAE) Materials and Methods: 9 women ages 33-62 (mean 44) with a mean BMI of 32 (range 22 8-48 4) underwent UAE via TP access by a single operator in an academic center 6 women had symptomatic fibroids, 2 women had hemorrhage from invasive uterine or cervical cancer, and 1 woman had post-partum hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation Patencies of tibio-pedal arteries were documented pre-procedurally with palpation and/or ultrasound With ultrasound guidance and micropuncture technique, a 5 French Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, USA) was placed and anti-spasmodic/anti-thrombotic medications were administered as previously reported for TR access Hemostasis was achieved at embolization procedures end with a large TR band (Terumo, USA) reinforced with cloth tape Proprietary catheters were used, though steam shaping of the base catheters was necessary for the initial cases All 6 patients undergoing UAE for fibroids were discharged home the same day Metrics evaluated were technical success, fluoroscopy time, clinical results and complications Results: 8 of 9 UAEs were successfully performed via TP access;one patient required cross over to TF access for ipsilateral uterine artery catheterization No clinically significant procedural complication occurred Average fluoroscopy time was 38 3 minutes, though the last four cases performed with a proprietary cobra shaped catheter led to reduction of average fluoroscopy usage to 23 4 minutes All patients with fibroids had either unchanged or palliated symptoms at short-term follow-up, and inpatients with acute bleeding were discharged shortly after the embolizations with cessation of hemorrhage All patients expressed satisfaction with the vascular access, and access artery patency was objectively demonstrated from 5 hours post procedure to 6 weeks in clinic via either manual palpation or ultrasound in 6/8 patients;2 patients chose not to return to clinic during COVID-19 pandemic but were asymptomatic at phone follow-up;access arterial pulse could not be palpated in 2 asymptomatic patients at clinic follow-up (ultrasound was unavailable) Conclusions: The advantages of TP access mirror that of TR access, with few and mostly minor complications, and the risk of iatrogenic cerebral embolization is nil Tibio-pedal arteries are a feasible alternative access for uterine artery embolization","output":"Abstract No. 101 Tibial-pedal artery access for uterine artery embolization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Necrotizing pneumonia induced by Panton-Valentine leukocidin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus is a rare but life-threatening infection that has been described in patients after they had influenza.

METHOD: A qualitative and contextual research design was used to seek rich, in-depth data from 20 nurse educators who were purposively sampled. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted, and the data were analysed using Miles, Huberman and Salda?a method. RESULTS: The three themes that emerged were that nurse educators should (1) ensure an AL environment that promotes self skills, (2) engage learners in activities that will consciously evoke authentic self and (3) evaluate the developed self skills and metacognition.

Here, we demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (CCHFV-NP) augments mRNA translation. CCHFV-NP binds to the viral mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) with high affinity. It facilitates the translation of reporter mRNA both in vivo and in vitro with the assistance of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. CCHFV-NP equally favors the translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs, demonstrating the independence of this translation strategy on the 5' cap. Unlike the canonical host translation machinery, inhibition of eIF4F complex, an amalgam of three initiation factors, eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E, by the chemical inhibitor 4E1RCat did not impact the CCHFV-NP-mediated translation mechanism. However, the proteolytic degradation of eIF4G alone by the human rhinovirus 2A protease abrogated this translation strategy. Our results demonstrate that eIF4F complex formation is not required but eIF4G plays a critical role in this translation mechanism. Our results suggest that CCHFV has adopted a unique translation mechanism to facilitate the translation of viral mRNAs in the host cell cytoplasm where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation apparatus.IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a highly contagious viral disease endemic to more than 30 countries, has limited treatment options. Our results demonstrate that NP favors the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the viral mRNA 5' UTR. It is highly likely that CCHFV uses an NP-mediated translation strategy for the rapid synthesis of viral proteins during the course of infection. Shutdown of this translation mechanism might selectively impact viral protein synthesis, suggesting that an NP-mediated translation strategy is a target for therapeutic intervention against this viral disease.","output":"Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Augments mRNA Translation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To confirm an infection with the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) diagnostic assays for detection of SARS-CoV specific antibody are necessary.

Presently, the world is going through different phases of lock down in order to stop this wave of pandemic; India being no exception. We have also started the lock down on 23rd March 2020. In this current situation, apart from social distancing only a vaccine can be the proper solution to serve the population of human being. Thus it is important for all the nations to perform the genome-wide analysis in order to identify the genetic variation in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) so that proper vaccine can be designed. This fast motivated us to analyze publicly available 566 Indian complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to find the mutation points as substitution, deletion and insertion. In this regard, we have performed the multiple sequence alignment in presence of reference sequence from NCBI. After the alignment, a consensus sequence is build to analyze each genome in order to identify the mutation points. As a consequence, we have found 933 substitutions, 2449 deletions and 2 insertions, in total 3384 unique mutation points, in 566 genomes across 29.9 K bp. Further, it has been classified into three groups as 100 clusters of mutations (mostly deletions), 1609 point mutations as substitution, deletion and insertion and 64 SNPs. These outcomes are visualized using BioCircos and bar plots as well as plotting entropy value of each genomic location. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis has also been performed to see the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in India. It also shows the wide variation in tree which indeed vivid in genomic analysis.

Ada yang memilih menetapkan keadaan darurat berdasar konstitusi menggunakan UU yang berlaku tentang kebencanaan atau krisis kesehatan dan melakukan legislasi baru. Penetapan keadaan darurat memungkinkan negara melakukan penyimpangan keberlakuan hukum bahkan menangguhkan HAM sementara waktu. Oleh karenanya, penetapan status darurat berpotensi disalahgunakan dan berakibat pada tereduksinya jaminan perlindungan HAM. Tulisan ini menjelaskan kebijakan pemerintah Indonesia dalam memilih instrumen hukum untuk menanggulangi Pandemi COVID-19 satu sisi dan disisi lain bagaimana pemerintah tetap menjamin perlindungan HAM. Hasilnya, meskipun Pasal 12 UUD 1945 menyediakan ketentuan keadaan darurat konstitusional Indonesia memilih menggunakan Kedaruratan Kesehatan dalam UU 6 Tahun 2018 dan Darurat Bencana Non Alam dalam UU 24 Tahun 2007. Dua status darurat tersebut tidak sama sekali melibatkan Pasal 12 UUD 1945 sebagai dasar pembentukannya. Sehingga, keadaan darurat dimaksud bukanlah state of emergency sebagaimana dimaksud dalam kajian hukum tata negara darurat atau hanya bersifat de facto bukan de jure. Selain itu, dua status darurat tersebut tidak memuat berbagai syarat yang sudah diamanatkan ICCPR. Oleh karenanya, perlindungan HAM harus tetap dipenuhi. Meskipun ada pembatasan, hal tersebut tentunya tidak berlaku bagi hak yang bersifat mendasar apalagi terhadap kelompok non derogable rights. Kata Kunci: COVID-19;keadaan darurat;hukum tata negara darurat;hak asasi manusia Many countries are confused about which legal instrument is right to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Any country chooses to declare a state of emergency based on the constitution, use laws that apply to disasters or health crisis, and implement new legislation. The stipulation of a state of emergency allows the state to deviate from the rule of law and governments have introduced measures to legally justify limits on human rights. Therefore, the determination of the emergency status may be misused and result in human rights protection declines. This paper explains the Indonesian governments policy in choosing legal instruments to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and on the other hand how the government continues to guarantee the protection of human rights. As a result, although Article 12 of the 1945 Constitution stipulates the provision of an emergency, Indonesia chooses to use Health Emergency in Law 6 of 2018 and Non-Natural Disaster Emergency in Law 24 of 2007. The two emergency statuses do not involve Article 12 of the 1945 Constitution as the basis of its formation. The state of emergency is determined as an emergency as referred to in the study of the state of emergency or de facto not de jure. In addition, the two emergency statuses do not contain various requirements that have been mandated by the ICCPR. Therefore, the protection of human rights must always be fulfilled. Even if there are, this certainly does not apply to rights that are based only on non-derogable rights groups.

Carnosine (-alanyl-L-histidine) is a small di-peptide with numerous activities, including antioxidant effects, metal chelation, proton buffering capacity and the inhibition of protein carbonylation and glycoxidation. We have examined the preventive effects of carnosine on tissue injury, oedema and inflammation in a murine model for ARDS. Oral administration of carnosine suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular permeability, tissue injury and inflammation in the lung. In vivo imaging analysis revealed that LPS administration increased the level of ROS and that this increase was inhibited by carnosine administration. Carnosine also suppressed LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation (evaluated by activation of myeloperoxidase in the lung and increased extracellular DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Furthermore, carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response in vivo.

However, there is no adequate evidence regarding the attitude and perception of health professionals towards the COVID 19 vaccine in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess health professionals attitudes and perceptions towards COVID 19 vaccine in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers found in Nekemte town from April 14C21, 2021. A total of 439 health professionals present on duty during the study period was included in the study. The data were collected by using self-administered questionnaire. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 was used for data analysis. The binary logistic regression model was employed to determine factors associated with the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals was computed and statistical significance was declared at a 5% level (p-value < 0.05). RESULT: A total of 431 health professionals participated in the study yielding a response rate of 98.1%. The results indicated that 51.28% (95%CI: 45.12%, 57.34%) of health professionals had a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Having good knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.22, 0.64, P-value <0.001) was negatively associated with unfavorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine, whereas age less than 30 years (AOR = 2.14, 95%CI:1.25,3.67, P-value <0.001), working in a private clinic (AOR = 7.77, 95% CI: 2.19, 27.58, P-value <0.001) and health center (AOR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.01, 5.92, P-value = 0.045) were positively associated with unfavorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: In general, the attitude and perception of health care professionals toward the COVID-19 vaccine in the study area were unsatisfactory.

Yet, the presence of tumor immune evasion mechanisms represents a challenge for the development of efficient treatment options. Therefore, combination therapies are taking the center of the stage in immuno-oncology. Such combination therapies should boost anti-tumor immune responses and/or target tumor immune escape mechanisms, especially those created by major players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Natural killer (NK) cells were recently positioned at the forefront of many immunotherapy strategies, and several new approaches are being designed to fully exploit NK cell antitumor potential. One of the most relevant NK cell-activating receptors is NKG2D, a receptor that recognizes 8 different NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including MICA and MICB. MICA and MICB are poorly expressed on normal cells but become upregulated on the surface of damaged, transformed or infected cells as a result of post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms and intracellular pathways. Their engagement of NKG2D triggers NK cell effector functions. Also, MICA/B are polymorphic and such polymorphism affects functional responses through regulation of their cell-surface expression, intracellular trafficking, shedding of soluble immunosuppressive isoforms, or the affinity of NKG2D interaction. Although immunotherapeutic approaches that target the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis are under investigation, several tumor immune escape mechanisms account for reduced cell surface expression of NKG2DL and contribute to tumor immune escape. Also, NKG2DL polymorphism determines functional NKG2D-dependent responses, thus representing an additional challenge for leveraging NKG2DL in immuno-oncology. In this review, we discuss strategies to boost MICA/B expression and/or inhibit their shedding and propose that combination strategies that target MICA/B with antibodies and strategies aimed at promoting their upregulation on tumor cells or at reprograming TAM into pro-inflammatory macrophages and remodeling of the TME, emerge as frontrunners in immuno-oncology because they may unleash the antitumor effector functions of NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL).

This will benefit from the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 immunity, ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing. Current rapid point-of-care (POC) tests measure antibodies (Ab) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, these tests provide no information on whether the antibodies can neutralise virus infectivity and are potentially protective, especially against newly emerging variants of the virus. Neutralising Antibodies (NAb) are emerging as a strong correlate of protection, but most current NAb assays require many hours or days, samples of venous blood, and access to laboratory facilities, which is especially problematic in resource-limited settings. We have developed a lateral flow POC test that can measure levels of RBD-ACE2 neutralising antibodies from whole blood, with a result that can be determined by eye (semi-quantitative) or on a small instrument (quantitative), and results show high correlation with microneutralisation assays. This assay also provides a measure of total anti-RBD antibody, thereby providing evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether NAb are present in the sample. By testing samples from immunised macaques, we demonstrate that this test is equally applicable for use with animal samples, and we show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for immunity to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We also determined whether COVID-19 serologic testing of HCP decreased their self-reported anxiety. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study from May 13, 2020, to July 8, 2020, we used electronic surveys to capture participant self-reported symptoms before and after serologic testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibodies. Participants were physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, and nonclinical ED personnel at 20 geographically diverse United States EDs. We evaluated these domains: 1) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall stress and anxiety; 2) COVID-19-related work stressors; 3) burnout; and 4) PTSD risk (measured using the Primary Care-PTSD Screen for DSM-5, a 5-item screening instrument in which a score of &#8805;3 signifies high risk for PTSD). We also assessed perceptions of whether results of COVID-19 antibody testing decreased participants' self-reported anxiety. RESULTS: Of 1,606 participants, 100% and 88% responded to the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively. At baseline, approximately half (46%) reported symptoms of emotional exhaustion and burnout from their work, and 308 (19.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.3% to 21.1%) respondents screened positive for increased PTSD risk. Female respondents were more likely than males to screen positive (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.78).

They have a negative outlook on life and health-related issues. The aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of stress and anxiety in the relationship between type D personality and COVID-19 by adjustment of the effect of demographic characteristics and perceived symptoms as confounder variables. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE A total of 196 patients out of those suspected of having COVID-19 and visiting the reference hospitals were selected. They had completed the type D personality and the anxiety and stress scales along with their hospital admission form before undergoing COVID-19 testing. After their COVID-19 test, the participants were divided into two groups based on their disease, an infected group (n = 90) and a non-infected group (n = 106). RESULTS Type D personality has no significant direct effect on infection with the disease, but taking into account the mediating variable of stress, the odds of an event in those with type D personality is 2.21 times higher than those without this personality (p = .027) and, taking into account the mediating variable of anxiety, having a type D personality increases the odds of an event by 2.62 times (p = .011), holding demographic characteristics and perceived symptoms constant.

Here we investigated the interaction of L-SIGN (liver/lymph node specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin), a C-type lectin that functions as antigen receptor on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, with egg-derived glycan antigens of the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni. Our data demonstrate that L-SIGN binds both schistosomal soluble egg antigens (SEA) and egg glycosphingolipids, and can mediate internalization of SEA by L-SIGN expressing cells. Binding and internalization of SEA was strongly reduced after treatment of SEA with endoglycosidase H, whereas defucosylation affected neither binding nor internalization. These data indicate that L-SIGN predominantly interacts with oligomannosidic N-glycans of SEA. In contrast, binding to egg glycosphingolipids was completely abolished after defucosylation. Our data show that L-SIGN binds to a glycosphingolipid fraction containing fucosylated species with compositions of Hex(1)HexNAc(5?7)dHex(3?6)Cer, as evidenced by mass spectrometry. The L-SIGN gain of function mutant Ser363Val, which binds fucosylated Lewis antigens, did not bind to this fucosylated egg glycosphingolipid fraction, suggesting that L-SIGN displays different modes in binding fucoses of egg glycosphingolipids and Lewis antigens, respectively. Molecular modeling studies indicate that the preferred binding mode of L-SIGN to the respective fucosylated egg glycosphingolipid oligosaccharides involves a Fuc1-3GalNAc1-4(Fuc1-3)GlcNAc tetrasaccharide at the nonreducing end. In conclusion, our data indicate that L-SIGN recognizes both oligomannosidic N-glycans and multiply fucosylated carbohydrate motifs within Schistosoma egg antigens, which demonstrates that L-SIGN has a broad but specific glycan recognition profile.","output":"The C-type lectin L-SIGN differentially recognizes glycan antigens on egg glycosphingolipids and soluble egg glycoproteins from Schistosoma mansoni"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be observed as early as 14 days post- infection, but little is known about the stability of antibody levels over time. Here we evaluate the long-term stability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following infection in 402 adult donors. Methods. We performed a multi-centre study carried out at Plasma Donor Centres in the city of Heidelberg (Plasmazentrum Heidelberg, Germany) and Munich (Plasmazentrum M&uumlnchen, Germany). We present anti-S/N and anti-N IgG antibody levels in prospective serum samples collected up to 403 days post recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Results: The cohort includes 402 adult donors (185 female, 217 male; 17 - 68 years of age) where anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in plasma samples collected between 18- and 403-days post SARS-CoV-2 infection. A linear mixed effects model demonstrated IgG decay rates that decrease over time ({chi}2=176.8, p<0.00001) and an interaction of time*age ({chi}2=10.0, p<0.005)), with those over 60+ years showing the highest baseline IgG levels and the fastest rate of IgG decay. Baseline viral neutralization assays demonstrated that serum IgG levels correlated with in vitro neutralization capacity in 91% of our cohort. Conclusion.

Yet, the impact of the enforcement and subsequent loosening of these policies on the spread of COVID-19 is not well understood. Accordingly, we measure the impact of NPIs on mitigating disease spread by exploiting the spatio-temporal variations in policy measures across the 16 states of Germany. While this quasi-experiment does not allow for causal identification, each policy's effect on reducing disease spread provides meaningful insights. We adapt the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model for disease propagation to include data on daily confirmed cases, interstate movement, and social distancing. By combining the model with measures of policy contributions on mobility reduction, we forecast scenarios for relaxing various types of NPIs. Our model finds that in Germany policies that mandated contact restrictions (e.g., movement in public space limited to two persons or people co-living), closure of educational institutions (e.g., schools), and retail outlet closures are associated with the sharpest drops in movement within and across states. Contact restrictions appear to be most effective at lowering COVID-19 cases, while border closures appear to have only minimal effects at mitigating the spread of the disease, even though cross-border travel might have played a role in seeding the disease in the population. We believe that a deeper understanding of the policy effects on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 allows a more accurate forecast of disease spread when NPIs are partially loosened and gives policymakers better data for making informed decisions.","output":"Preparing for a future COVID-19 wave: insights and limitations from a data-driven evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients C effects that could not be explained by age or sex. In addition, using data from the UK Biobank, we implemented a candidate driven approach to evaluate linkage between severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and genetic variation associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Among our findings, our scan identified an eQTL for CD55 (a negative regulator of complement activation) and SNPs in Complement Factor H (CFH) and Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha (C4BPA), which play central roles in complement activation and innate immunity and were previously linked to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to several putative genetic markers of susceptibility.

It has been speculated that renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may promote COVID-19 by increasing ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells, along with the host protease TMPRSS2. Taking a reverse translational approach and by combining in situ hybridization, primary cell isolation, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and LC-MS/MS we studied lung and kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice mimicking host factors linked to severe COVID-19. In healthy young mice, neither the ACE inhibitor ramipril nor the AT1 receptor blocker telmisartan affected lung or kidney ACE2 or TMPRSS2, except for a small increase in kidney ACE2 protein with ramipril. In contrast, mice with comorbid diabetes (aging, high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes) had heightened lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels and increased lung ACE2 activity. None of these parameters were affected by RAS blockade. ACE2 was similarly upregulated in the kidneys of mice with comorbid diabetes compared to aged controls, whereas TMPRSS2 (primarily distal nephron) was highest in telmisartan-treated animals. Upregulation of lung ACE2 activity in comorbid diabetes may contribute to increased risk of severe COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with the development of cytokine storm (including interleukin 6 (IL-6)), which can cause lung damage and lack of oxygen. Tocilizumab (TCZ) inhibits ligand binding to the IL-6 receptor and may be a potential treatment for the hyperinflammation symptoms of COVID-19. However, data regarding the efficacy of TCZ in COVID-19 are lacking. The rapid spread of the pandemic in France, especially in the Paris region, constrained us to the off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe clinical conditions. METHODS: A single-centre observational cohort study of 44 patients infected with COVID-19 was carried out between 6 April and 21 April 2020 in Groupe Hospitalier Intercommunal Le Raincy-Montfermeil (GHILRM). Twenty-two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were treated with TCZ and were compared with 22 patients not treated with TCZ matched for age, gender and length of hospital stay for COVID-19. Respiratory rate and oxygen supplementation as well as laboratory parameters (such as C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were collected at baseline and during 14 days of follow-up. Our primary objective was to assess the efficacy of TCZ on respiratory clinical conditions. FINDINGS: The average respiratory rate was lower in the TCZ group than in the control group (21.5 vs 25.5 breaths/min at day 14, 95% CI ?7.5 to ?0.4; p=0.03). Treated patients tended to be intubated less during the course of the disease (2/22 vs 6/22, 95% CI ?0.4 to 0.1; p=0.12). In each group, 10 patients no longer required oxygen therapy. We found a significant decrease in CRP in treated patients on day 7 (p=0.04). TCZ caused cytolysis in more than half (14/22) of the patients but without clinical impact. INTERPRETATION: There was a significant difference in the respiratory rate on day 14 of follow-up, with a greater decrease observed in the treated group. Fewer patients required mechanical ventilation in the TCZ group, especially among patients with more extensive CT lung damage, than in the control group. The same number of patients were weaned off oxygen on day 14 in the two groups, while the patients in the TCZ group had more severe impairment at inclusion. We consider that TCZ showed significant control of the biological inflammatory syndrome, suggesting that it may limit the effect of the cytokine storm. Our study seems to indicate the efficacy of TCZ, particularly in patients with severe initial pulmonary impairment. Selecting the best candidates and the best timing for TCZ therapy needs to be determined in randomised clinical trials.","output":"Observational study on off-label use of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study is a comparative analysis of the first and second wave of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to assess the impact on health of people for designing effective policy responses to constrain negative effects of future infectious diseases similar to COVID-19 in society.

The sudden increase in the number of patients and deaths from this novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious challenge to all arenas of health care delivery system. The care of high-time dependent-factor illnesses is essential for the survival of a patient and the need for avoiding impairment of health. The purpose of the review is to highlight that a change in first-aid attitudes can be assumed behind the delay in immediate interventions initiated by first responders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To maintain socially important first aid, the European Resuscitation Council amended its guidelines on first aid, basic life support and made further recommendations at the time of pandemic on first-aid education, too.

With them staying more at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, more educational tools and valid educational programs are warranted to improve parental knowledge and awareness about childhood and adolescences safety. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of childhood and adolescence safety campaigns on parents knowledge and attitude toward preventable injuries. METHODS: This was a preCpost experimental study, in which the predesigned assessments were used as an evaluation tool before and after attending a childhood and adolescence safety campaign. The preCpost assessment question included questions to evaluate the socio-demographic status, followed by knowledge questions in line with the current childhood and adolescence safety campaign. The outcomes of interest were assessed before and after attending the campaign's stations. RESULTS: Three hundred eight parents volunteered to participate in this study. Their knowledge score improved from 36.2 [standard deviation (SD) 17.7] to 79.3 (SD 15.6) after attending the Campaign (t value = 34.6, P < .001). Both, perceptions on the preventability of accidents and the parents perceived usefulness of educational campaigns showed improvements, with (t value = 6.3, P < .001) and (t value = 3.097, P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: The educational childhood and adolescence safety campaign for caregivers in Saudi Arabia resulted in a significant increase in the overall knowledge and attitudes toward childhood and adolescence's safety. As children and adolescents are currently staying at home more, additional educational tools and programs are warranted to promote safe practices among parents and caregivers.","output":"Enhancing parental knowledge of childhood and adolescence safety: An interventional educational campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complement system has long been recognized as a potential druggable target for a variety of inflammatory conditions. Very few complement inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, but a great number are in clinical development, nearly all of which systemically inhibit complement. There are benefits of targeting complement inhibition to sites of activation/disease in terms of efficacy and safety, and here we describe P-selectin targeted complement inhibitors, with and without a dual function of directly blocking P-selectin-mediated cell-adhesion. The constructs are characterized in vitro and in murine models of hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion injury and hindlimb transplantation. Both constructs specifically targeted to reperfused hindlimb and provided protection in the hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion injury model. The P-selectin blocking construct was the more efficacious, which correlated with less myeloid cell infiltration, but with similarly reduced levels of complement deposition. The blocking construct also improved tissue perfusion and, unlike the nonblocking construct, inhibited coagulation, raising the possibility of differential application of each construct, such as in thrombotic vs. hemorrhagic conditions. Similar outcomes were obtained with the blocking construct following vascularized composite graft transplantation, and treatment also significantly increased graft survival. This is outcome may be particularly pertinent in the context of vascularized composite allograft transplantation, since reduced ischemia reperfusion injury is linked to a less rigorous alloimmune response that may translate to the requirement of a less aggressive immunosuppressive regime for this normally nonlife-threatening procedure. In summary, we describe a new generation of targeted complement inhibitor with multi-functionality that includes targeting to vascular injury, P-selectin blockade, complement inhibition and anti-thrombotic activity. The constructs described also bound to both mouse and human P-selectin which may facilitate potential translation.","output":"Characterization of Novel P-Selectin Targeted Complement Inhibitors in Murine Models of Hindlimb Injury and Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary discusses the COVID-19 pandemic on the African continent.

However, only little is known about the humoral immune response against these viruses. Our aim was to establish virus-specific serological assays and to determine the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against these three viruses in the general population. METHODS: The capsid proteins VP1 of WUPyV and KIPyV and VP2 of HBoV were cloned into baculovirus vectors and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. IgG antibodies against WUPyV VP1, KIPyV VP1, and HBoV VP2 were determined by immunofluorescence assays in 100 plasma samples of blood donors. RESULTS: The median age of the blood donors was 31 years (range 20 - 66 yrs), 52% were male. 89% of the samples were positive for WUPyV IgG (median age 31 yrs, 49.4% male), 67% were positive for KIPyV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 46.3% male), and 76% were positive for HBoV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 51.3% male). For WUPyV and HBoV, there were no significant differences of the seropositivity rates with respect to age groups or gender. For KIPyV, the seropositivity rate increased significantly from 59% in the age group 20 - 29 years to 100% in the age group > 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalences of antibodies against WUPyV, KIPyV, and HBoV were found in plasma samples of healthy adults. The results indicate that primary infection with these viruses occurs during childhood or youth.

Due to the complexity of features, the enormous size of the picture/frame, and the severe inhomogeneity of image data, efficient face image classification using deep convolutional neural networks remains a challenge. Therefore, as data volumes continue to grow, the effective categorization of face photos in a mobile context utilizing advanced deep learning techniques is becoming increasingly important. In the recent past, some Deep Learning (DL) approaches for learning to identify face images have been designed;many of them use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To address the problem of face mask recognition in facial images, we propose to use a Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network based on MobileNet (DWS-based MobileNet). The proposed network utilizes depth-wise separable convolution layers instead of 2D convolution layers. With limited datasets, the DWS-based MobileNet performs exceptionally well. DWS-based MobileNet decreases the number of trainable parameters while enhancing learning performance by adopting a lightweight network. Our technique outperformed the existing state of the art when tested on benchmark datasets. When compared to Full Convolution MobileNet and baseline methods, the results of this study reveal that adopting Depthwise Separable Convolution-based MobileNet significantly improves performance (Acc. = 93.14, Pre. = 92, recall = 92, F-score = 92).","output":"Facial Mask Detection Using Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network Model During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of H2O2 on adenovirus types 3 and 6, adenoassociated virus type 4, rhinoviruses 1A, 1B, and type 7, myxoviruses, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, strain Long, and coronavirus strain 229E was studied in vitro, using different H2O2 concentration and timec of exposure.

Rabbits were treated with pulsed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and corticosteroid methylprednisolone (MPS). At 2, 4, and 6weeks after induction, Src siRNA, control siRNA and saline were intramedullary injected into proximal femur, respectively. Two fluorescent dyes xylenol orange and calcein green were injected before sacrificing the animals for in vivo labeling of the newly formed bone. At week 6 after induction, proximal femora of rabbits were dissected for micro-CT and histological analysis. Results showed significant bone loss in the metaphysis of femoral head in the control rabbits after SAON induction. Src siRNA treatment was able to prevent steroid-associate bone loss in trabecular bone and increase cortical bone thickness at femoral neck. Histomorphometry showed that Src siRNA increased the osteoblastic bone formation and decreased the eroded bone surfaces suggesting decreased osteoclastic bone resorption.

Traditional management options include open reduction internal fixation, or conservative treatment, both of which are fraught with high complication rates. We aimed to present functional outcomes of elderly patients with fragility ankle fractures treated with retrograde ankle fusion nails. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on patients who underwent intramedullary nailing with a tibiotalocalcaneal nail. Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria of being over sixty and having multiple co-morbidities. Patient demographics, AO/OTA fracture classification, intra-operative and post-operative complications, time to mobilisation and union, AOFAS and Olerud-Molander scores, and patient mobility were recorded. RESULTS: There were seven males and thirteen females, with a mean age of 77.82 years old, five of whom are type 2 diabetics. Thirteen patients returned to their pre-operative mobility state, and the average Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) was 5.05. Patients with a low CCI are more likely to return to pre-operative mobility status (p = 0.16; OR = 4.00). All patients achieved radiographical union, taking on average between 92.5 days and 144.6 days. The mean post-operative AOFAS and Olerud-Molander scores were 53.0 and 50.9, respectively. There were four cases of superficial infection, four cases of broken or loose distal locking screws. There were no deep infections, periprosthetic fractures, nail breakages, or non-unions. CONCLUSION: Tibiotalocalcaneal nailing is an effective and safe option for managing unstable ankle fractures in the elderly.

Bat species forming large social groups and roosting in proximity to human communities are of particular interest. In this study, we sampled a colony of ca. 350,000 individuals of the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum in Kumasi, the second largest city of Ghana. A novel rhabdovirus (Kumasi rhabdovirus [KRV]) was isolated in E. helvum cell cultures and passaged to Vero cells as well as interferon-competent human and primate cells (A549 and MA104). Genome composition was typical for a rhabdovirus. KRV was detected in 5.1% of 487 animals, showing association with the spleen but not the brain. Antibody prevalence was 11.5% by immunofluorescence and 6.4% by plaque reduction virus neutralization test (PRNT). Detection throughout 3 sampling years was pronounced in both annual wet seasons, of which only one overlaps the postparturition season. Juvenile bats showed increased viral prevalence. No evidence of infection was obtained in 1,240 female mosquitos (6 different genera) trapped in proximity to the colony to investigate potential vector association. Antibodies were found in 28.9% (5.4% by PRNT) of 107 swine sera but not in similarly large collections of sheep, goat, or cattle sera. The antibody detection rate in human subjects with occupational exposure to the bat colony was 11% (5/45 persons), which was significantly higher than in unexposed adults (0.8% [1/118]; chi square, P < 0.001).

Here we investigate the correlation between the time series of daily infections and of settling times of virus-containing particles produced by speaking. Characteristic droplet settling times determined by the Stokes-Cunningham equation as influenced by daily weather conditions were estimated based on local meteorological data. Daily infection data were calibrated from local reported cases based on established infection timeframes. Linear regression, vector autoregression, simple recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory models predict transmission rates within one-sigma intervals using the settling times and viral viability over 5 days before the day of prediction.

Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 ? cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.

METHODS: A 66-year-old woman with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and a unilateral Descemets membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) transplant received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 14 days post-transplant. Seven days later, she presented with symptoms and signs of endothelial graft rejection. An 83-year-old woman with bilateral DMEK transplants for FECD 3 and 6 years earlier developed simultaneous acute endothelial rejection in both eyes, 3 weeks post second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Rejection in both cases was treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is the first report of temporal association between corneal transplant rejection following immunisation against COVID-19 and the first report of DMEK rejection following any immunisation. We hypothesise that the allogeneic response may have been initiated by the host antibody response following vaccination. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential of corneal graft rejection associated with vaccine administration and may wish to consider vaccination in advance of planned non-urgent keratoplasties.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has created intense anxiety in nurses/midwives that may affect the care they provide. Nurses and midwives may manage anxiety using solution-focused thinking skills. METHODS: This descriptive correlational study included 170 nurses/midwives at 61 family health centres evaluated from 1 August to 14 September 2020. RESULTS: The participants' state and trait anxiety scores were above average, indicating a moderate level of anxiety and the mean total solution-focused inventory scores were at a moderate level. It was determined that 47.9% of the variance in state anxiety scores could be explained by trait anxiety, age, years of professional experience, chronic illness, type of work shift during the pandemic, follow-up of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using computed tomography or a COVID-19 test, and whether the institution was taking necessary measures against COVID-19. There was a negative relationship between state anxiety and solution-focused inventory total score. CONCLUSION: Nurses/midwives displayed a moderate level of anxiety and solution-focused thinking skills during the COVID-19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies investigating the association between vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease and mortality among those infected have yielded mixed results. Thus far, the majority of studies investigating the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 have been observational and rely on vitamin D levels obtained at the time of admission, limiting causal inference. Currently, clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with COVID-19 infection are extremely limited. Randomized, interventional trials may offer more clarity on the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19 infection and outcomes. SUMMARY: Decreased levels of vitamin D may amplify the inflammatory effects of COVID-19 infection, yet, data regarding the mortality benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals are still limited. Current observational data provides the impetus for future studies to including randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals with kidney disease can improve mortality outcomes.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019, vitamin D and kidney function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emergent pathogens that may cause life-threatening respiratory diseases in humans. Understanding of CoV-host interactions may help to identify novel therapeutic targets. MOV10 is an RNA helicase involved in different steps of cellular RNA metabolism. Both MOV10 antiviral and proviral activities have been described in a limited number of viruses, but this protein has not been previously associated with CoVs. We found that during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, MOV10 aggregated in cytoplasmic structures colocalizing with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. MOV10-N interaction was confirmed by endogenous MOV10 coimmunoprecipitation, and the presence of other cellular proteins was also detected in MOV10 complexes. MOV10 silencing significantly increased both N protein accumulation and virus titer, with no changes in the accumulation of viral RNAs. Moreover, MOV10 overexpression caused a 10-fold decrease in viral titers. These data indicated that MOV10 has antiviral activity during MERS-CoV infection. We postulated that this activity could be mediated by viral RNA sequestration, and in fact, RNA immunoprecipitation data showed the presence of viral RNAs in the MOV10 cytoplasmic complexes. Expression of wild-type MOV10 or of a MOV10 mutant without helicase activity in MOV10 knockout cell lines, developed by CRISPR-Cas technology, indicated that the helicase activity of MOV10 was required for its antiviral effect. Interestingly MOV10-N interaction was conserved in other mildly or highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although MOV10 antiviral activity was found only in highly pathogenic CoVs, suggesting a potential role of MOV10 in the modulation of human CoVs pathogenesis.","output":"MOV10 Helicase Interacts with Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein and Has Antiviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) encodes for two viral proteases (NSP3/ papain-like protease and NSP5/ 3C-like protease or major protease) that are responsible for cleaving viral polyproteins for successful replication. NSP3 and NSP5 of SARS-CoV (SARS1) are known interferon antagonists. Here, we examined whether the protease function of SARS2 NSP3 and NSP5 target proteins involved in the host innate immune response. We designed a fluorescent based cleavage assay to rapidly screen the protease activity of NSP3 and NSP5 on a library of 71 human innate immune proteins (HIIPs), covering most pathways involved in human innate immunity. By expressing each of these HIIPs with a genetically encoded fluorophore in a cell-free system and titrating in the recombinant protease domain of NSP3 or NSP5, we could readily detect cleavage of cognate HIIPs on SDS-page gels. We identified 3 proteins that were specifically and selectively cleaved by NSP3 or NSP5: IRF-3, and NLRP12 and TAB1, respectively. Direct cleavage of IRF3 by NSP3 could explain the blunted Type- I IFN response seen during SARS-CoV-2 infections while NSP5 mediated cleavage of NLRP12 and TAB1 point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL-6 and inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, both NLRP12 and TAB1 have each two distinct cleavage sites. We demonstrate that in mice, the second cleavage site of NLRP12 is absent. We pushed this comparative alignment of IRF-3 and NLRP12 homologs and show that the lack or presence of cognate cleavage motifs in IRF-3 and NLRP12 could contribute to the presentation of disease in cats and tigers, for example. Our findings provide an explanatory framework for in-depth studies into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and should facilitate the search or development of more effective animal models for severe COVID-19. Finally, we discovered that one particular species of bats, Davids Myotis, possesses the five cleavage sites found in humans for NLRP12, TAB1 and IRF3.

Malaria vectors comprise many Anopheles species, which vary in abundance and importance in malaria transmission among different geographical locations in the GMS. Information about the species composition, abundance, and insecticide resistance status of vectorial systems in Myanmar is scarce, hindering our efforts to effectively control malaria vectors in this region. METHODS: During October and November 2019, larvae and adult females of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in three sentinel villages of Banmauk township in northern Myanmar. Adult female mosquitoes collected by cow-baited tent collection (CBTC) and adults reared from field-collected larvae (RFCL) were used to determine mortality rates and knockdown resistance (kdr) against deltamethrin using the standard WHO susceptibility test. Molecular species identification was performed by multiplex PCR and ITS2 PCR, followed by DNA sequencing. The kdr mutation at position 1014 of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was genotyped by DNA sequencing for all Anopheles species tested. RESULTS: A total of 1596 Anopheles mosquitoes from seven morphologically identified species groups were bioassayed. Confirmed resistance to deltamethrin was detected in the populations of An. barbirostris (s.l.), An. hyrcanus (s.l.), and An. vagus, while possible resistance was detected in An. annularis (s.l.), An. minimus, and An. tessellatus. Anopheles kochi was found susceptible to deltamethrin. Compared to adults collected by CBTC, female adults from RFCL had significantly lower mortality rates in the four species complexes. A total of 1638 individuals from 22 Anopheles species were molecularly identified, with the four most common species being An. dissidens (20.5%) of the Barbirostris group, An. peditaeniatus (19.4%) of the Hyrcanus group, An. aconitus (13.4%) of the Funestus group, and An. nivipes (11.5%) of the Annularis group. The kdr mutation L1014F was only detected in the homozygous state in two An. subpictus (s.l.) specimens and in a heterozygous state in one An. culicifacies (s.l.) specimen. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides updated information about malaria vector species composition and insecticide resistance status in northern Myanmar. The confirmed deltamethrin resistance in multiple species groups constitutes a significant threat to malaria vector control. The lack or low frequency of target-site resistance mutations suggests that other mechanisms are involved in resistance. Continual monitoring of the insecticide resistance of malaria vectors is required for effective vector control and insecticide resistance management.

Methods: Influenza AEs were evaluated in pts with RA from 21 Phase (P)1-3b/4 trials and two open-label, long-term extension (LTE) studies from 2005-2019. These were analysed as two cohorts: P2-3b/4 cohort (pts who received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily [BID] as monotherapy or with conventional synthetic [cs]DMARDs, adalimumab, methotrexate or placebo, in P2-3b/4 controlled studies) and Overall cohort (pts who received 1 tofacitinib dose, as monotherapy or with csDMARDs, in P1-3b/4 and LTE studies;data were summarised by average tofacitinib dose [average tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID based on average total daily dose of <15 or 15 mg, respectively]). Incidence rates (IRs;unique pts with events/100 pt-years of exposure;censored at day of first event or up to last dose +28 days) were evaluated for influenza AEs, influenza complication AEs, influenza-like illness (all composites of several MedDRA preferred/verbatim terms) and overall influenza AEs (composite of all preferred/verbatim terms included under influenza AEs, influenza complication AEs and influenza-like illness). In the Overall cohort, the incidence of serious non-influenza AEs within 28 days of the start of an overall influenza AE and time taken to resolution of overall influenza AEs by action taken were summarised descriptively. Results: In total, 7964 pts were included;517 (6.5%) pts reported overall influenza AEs, three of which occurred outside the risk period. In the P2-3b/4 cohort (N=6690), IRs for influenza AEs, influenza-like illness and overall influenza AEs generally appeared similar across treatment arms (Figure 1a). In the Overall cohort, IRs for influenza AEs and influenza-like illness were similar between tofacitinib doses (Figure 1b), and IRs for overall influenza AEs were similar between tofacitinib doses and pt age groups (Figure 1c). No influenza complication AEs (eg pneumonia/encephalitis influenzal) were reported in either cohort. Among pts with overall influenza AEs, nine (1.7%) had serious overall influenza AEs (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=3). Of these pts, eight (1.5%) were hospitalised (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=2) and two (0.4%) died (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=1;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=1). Both deaths occurred in pts with H1N1 Influenza A. Twelve (2.3%) pts had a serious non-influenza AE within 28 days of the start of the overall influenza AE (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=6). The most common serious non-influenza AEs (one event each in average tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID groups) were acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. In most pts with overall influenza AEs, no change to tofacitinib treatment was made (70.2%, n=363) or treatment was stopped temporarily (28.2%, n=146) for a mean duration of 11.0 days. The mean number of days to resolution of overall influenza AEs was numerically similar, ranging from 10.4-11.8 days across tofacitinib doses, irrespective of these actions. Conclusion: This post hoc analysis of influenza AEs across the tofacitinib RA clinical programme, over 14-15 influenza seasons, showed generally similar rates between treatment groups, and between tofacitinib doses and pt age groups. Limitations include varying exposure across treatment arms in the P2-3b/4 cohort. Most influenza AEs were non-serious (98.3%), and were not associated with changes to tofacitinib treatment.","output":"Influenza adverse events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the tofacitinib clinical programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sebagai sebuah dasar dari ilmu pengetahuan maka penting kiranya filsafat ilmu dijadikan sebagai pisau kajian untuk membahas permasalahan aktual yang sedang terjadi.

We first discuss how to embed observational data with a time-independent, continuous treatment dose into an approximate randomized experiment, and develop a randomization-based procedure that tests if a structured dose-response relationship fits the data. We then generalize the design and testing procedure to accommodate a time-dependent, treatment dose trajectory, and generalize a dose-response relationship to a longitudinal setting. Finally, we apply the proposed design and testing procedures to investigate the effect of social distancing during the phased reopening in the United States on public health outcomes using data compiled from sources including Unacast, the United States Census Bureau, and the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program. We rejected a primary analysis null hypothesis that stated the social distancing from April 27, 2020, to June 28, 2020, had no effect on the COVID-19-related death toll from June 29, 2020, to August 2, 2020 (p-value < 0.001), and found that it took more reduction in mobility to prevent exponential growth in case numbers for non-rural counties compared to rural counties.","output":"Social Distancing and COVID-19: Randomization Inference for a Structured Dose-Response Relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health information technology can support the development of national learning health and care systems, which can be defined as health and care systems that continuously use data-enabled infrastructure to support policy and planning, public health, and personalisation of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.","output":"Health information technology and digital innovation for national learning health and care systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allogenic transplants of the cornea are prone to rejection, especially in repetitive transplantation and in scarred or highly vascularized recipient sites. Patients with these ailments would particularly benefit from the possibility to use non-immunogenic decellularized tissue scaffolds for transplantation, which may be repopulated by host cells in situ or in vitro. So, the aim of this study was to develop a fast and efficient decellularization method for creating a human corneal extracellular matrix scaffold suitable for repopulation with human cells from the corneal limbus. To decellularize human donor corneas, sodium deoxycholate, deoxyribonuclease I, and dextran were assessed to remove cells and nuclei and to control tissue swelling, respectively. We evaluated the decellularization effects on the ultrastructure, optical, mechanical, and biological properties of the human cornea. Scaffold recellularization was studied using primary human limbal epithelial cells, stromal cells, and melanocytes in vitro and a lamellar transplantation approach ex vivo. Our data strongly suggest that this approach allowed the effective removal of cellular and nuclear material in a very short period of time while preserving extracellular matrix proteins, glycosaminoglycans, tissue structure, and optical transmission properties. In vitro recellularization demonstrated good biocompatibility of the decellularized human cornea and ex vivo transplantation revealed complete epithelialization and stromal repopulation from the host tissue. Thus, the generated decellularized human corneal scaffold could be a promising biological material for anterior corneal reconstruction in the treatment of corneal defects.","output":"A decellularized human corneal scaffold for anterior corneal surface reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taking stock of the global mental health challenges created by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Schimmenti, Billieux, and Starcevic (2020) recently provided, in this journal, a radically new theoretical framework for conceptualizing the experience of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Transforming social environment, Covid-19 pandemics has greatly affected lifestyle of all people around the globe. In this matter, students are not an exception. The aim of the study was to describe self-reported stress and behaviors of students at the University of Georgia during Covid-19 pandemics. METHODS: In frame of online survey design, self-administrative semi-structured Questionnaires (Geo/Eng) were disseminated via UG's intranet. Target population was BA, MA and One-Cycle Program students with active status (6545). Questionnaires were available during two weeks. RESULTS: In result, 446 (CL = 95%; CI = 5) students participated in online survey. Students reported physiological, emotional, and cognitive symptoms they never noticed before moving to online learning due to Covid-19 pandemics. Both, local and foreign students reported headaches (30%) and Feeling of being depressed (25%). Fatigue (25%) and irritation (28%) was marked by local students, nearly 20% of foreign students marked hardness of dealing with the life problems. Changing of sleep and physical activity patterns were highlighted by both local and international students. In average, 55% students evaluated their sleep as deteriorated or very deteriorated. 60% of students could recall only 3 days or less when they walked for at least 10 minutes without break. 35% noticed increase or significant increase of body weight. Nearly 30% of students evaluated their stress level as 8; 9; or 10 at ten-point scale (0=no stress; 10=high stress level). CONCLUSIONS: Study hasn't shown significant differences between local and international students. Negative changes were reported in physical and emotional level, physical activity and sleep patterns.

To assess the socio-economic characteristics of the neighborhoods across the state, we calculated the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) using the U.S. Census, American Community Survey (5-year estimates) of 2017. To assess the digital divide, at the community level, we used the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data on the number of residential fixed Internet access service connections. We assessed the availability of and web-based access to community-based social service agencies using data provided by the Aunt Bertha information platform. We performed community and regional level descriptive and special analyses for ADI social risk factors, connectivity, and both the availability of and web-based searches for community-based social services. To help assess potential neighborhood linked factors associated with the rates of web-based social services searches by individuals in need, we applied logistic regression using generalized estimating equation modeling. Baltimore City contained more disadvantaged neighborhoods compared to other areas in Maryland. In Baltimore City, 20.3% of neighborhoods (defined by census block groups) were disadvantaged with ADI at the 90th percentile while only 6.6% of block groups across Maryland were in this disadvantaged category. Across the State, more than half of all census tracts had 801C1000 households (per 1000 households) with internet subscription. In contrast, in Baltimore City about half of all census tracts had only 401C600 of the households (per 1000 households) with internet subscriptions.

The CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) uses 15 indicators grouped into four themes that comprise an overall SVI measure, resulting in 20 metrics, each of which has national and state-specific county rankings. The 20 metric-specific rankings were each divided into lowest to highest tertiles to categorize counties as low, moderate, or high social vulnerability counties. These tertiles were combined with vaccine administration data for 49,264,338 U.S. residents in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) who received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose during December 14, 2020-March 1, 2021. Nationally, for the overall SVI measure, vaccination coverage was higher (15.8%) in low social vulnerability counties than in high social vulnerability counties (13.9%), with the largest coverage disparity in the socioeconomic status theme (2.5 percentage points higher coverage in low than in high vulnerability counties). Wide state variations in equity across SVI metrics were found.

Background Uncertainty is consubstantial with psychoanalytic practice, which is based on an openness to the unknown. The fundamental rule institutes the experience on which the treatment is based, and is, at the same time, the most appropriate methodological answer to the logics of infantile sexuality and the motor of its subjective appropriation. Objectives To this fertile uncertainty, the author opposes an uncertainty based on vital dependancy that, on account of passionate bonding, tends to freeze the analytic process and threatens to destroy the cure. Therefore, it is a question of problematizing the regime of uncertainty proper to limit-experiences. This experience of death struggle against death is engaged when an apparently hopeless hold is exerted on a human being and dispossesses him/her of an impersonal right to life (N. Zaltzman, 1998). What resources does psychoanalytic practice have in such a context? Method The author draws on both his clinical practice as a psychoanalyst and his work as a supervisor of teams confronted with situations of extreme precarity. Anthropological and artistic fields are also called upon to explore the logic of the limit-experience. The author examines the concept of the anarchist drive theorized by Nathalie Zaltzman: he proposes a critical re-examination while underlining its great value on the clinical level. In the wake of this questioning, the author questions psychoanalysis with regard to the environmental crisis, conceived of a limit-experience to come. Results What resources does psychoanalysis possess in its struggles with limit-experiences? Clinical work in the anarchist regime secures the constitution of a singular resistance in the heart of the death zones. Its vocation is to psychically arm subjects with a capacity to enjoy existence in spite of everything, without sinking into psychosis, apathy, or alienation. Marked by a limit-experience (the Covid-19 crisis, for example), a psychoanalysis worked-through by the anarchist drive can, in return, undertake the work of re-examining of its foundations and of displacing its founding paradigms. Conclusion This text questions the clinical and theoretical paradigm shifts required by a specific regime of uncertainty, that of the limit-experience. The clinical questioning is coupled with an anthropological questioning, against the background of the environmental crisis. This text constitutes a first approach and tries to lay down some milestones in the heart of a considerable construction site.","output":"Trompe-la-mort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review The outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia has been spreading all over the world, drawing worldwide attention However, the origin of the novel coronavirus has not been determined yet Traditional Chinese medicine played an important role in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection The state attaches great importance to the role of TCM in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and strengthens the early intervention of TCM in medical treatment Traditional Chinese medicine has its own characteristics and advantages in the prevention and treatment of viral pneumonia, with better clin efficacy and fewer side effects In addition to eliminating or alleviating clin symptoms, it can also regulate the immune function of patients and prevent the overreaction of the body caused by viruses This article reviews the research on the immunomodulatory action of traditional Chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of viral pneumonia, hoping to provide some reference for the clin medication and later basic research of viral pneumonia including SARS-CoV-2","output":"Research progress on immunomodulatory effect of Chinese materia medica and prescriptions on viral pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we first explore the changes in German medical device law in light of the EU Medical Device Regulation In this respect, we will outline the legislative status quo and give an overview on the respective German law, which passed the German parliament on 27 March 2020 and came into effect on 26 May 2020 We will then assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the date of application of the new Medical Device Regulation Finally, we will outline the position in the UK amid Brexit ? 2020, TOPRA All rights reserved","output":"Medical device laws in Germany, the impact of COVID-19 and brexit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention).

It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. We further present the databases and major future challenges of DL-based COVID-19 detection. The computed tomography of the chest and X-ray images gives a rich representation of the patients lung that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using the DL algorithms. The first step is the preprocessing of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pretrained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease. In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough analysis to early screen the COVID-19 and human mobility estimation to limit its spread.","output":"Deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection and diagnosis using images and acoustic-based techniques: a recent review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis of published academic research on innovation in hotels.

We aimed to assess the impact of a large-scale COVID-19 telemedicine system on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Brazil. METHODS: From March 18-May 18, 2020 we evaluated the database of a cooperative private health insurance, with 1.28 million clients. The COVID-19 telemedicine system consisted of: a) mobile app, which redirects to teleconsultations if indicated; b) telemonitoring system, with regular phone calls to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases to monitor progression; c) emergency ambulance system (EAS), with internet phone triage and counselling. ED visits and hospital admissions were recorded, with diagnoses assessed by the Diagnosis Related Groups method. COVID-19 diagnosis and deaths were identified from the patients' registries, and outcomes assessed until June 1st. RESULTS: In 60 days, 24,354 patients accessed one of the telemedicine systems. The most frequently utilized was telemonitoring (16,717, 69%), followed by teleconsultation (13,357, 55%) and EAS (687, 3%). The rates of ED and hospital admissions were: telemonitoring 19.7% (3,296) and 4.7% (782); teleconsultation 17.3% (2,313) and 2.4% (318) and EAS: 55.9% (384) and 56.5% (388) patients. At total 4.1% (1,010) had hospital admissions, 36% (363) with respiratory diseases (44 requiring mechanical ventilation) and 4.4% (44) with cardiovascular diagnoses. Overall, 277 (1.1%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and 160 (0.7%) died, 9 with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine resulted in low rates of ED visits and hospital admissions, suggesting positive impacts on healthcare utilization. Cardiovascular admissions were remarkably rare.","output":"Impact of a large-scale telemedicine network on emergency visits and hospital admissions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Brazil: Data from the UNIMED-BH system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has affected different groups of humankind such as farmers, soldiers, drivers, educators, students, healthcare workers and many others. The transmission rate of the disease varies from one group to another depending on the contact rate. Healthcare workers are at a high risk of contracting the disease due to the high contact rate with patients. So far, there exists no mathematical model which combines both public control measures (as a parameter) and healthcare workers (as an independent compartment). Combining these two in a given mathematical model is very important because healthcare workers are protected through effective use of personal protective equipment, and control measures help to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in the community. This paper presents a mathematical model named SWE [Formula: see text] HR; susceptible individuals (S), healthcare workers (W), exposed (E), symptomatic infectious ([Formula: see text]), asymptomatic infectious ([Formula: see text]), hospitalized (H), recovered (R).

Disability Nurse Navigators assume a critical intermediary role between the healthcare system and this population. AIM: To discuss the impact that rapid service change, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can have on people with disability and the work of Disability Nurse Navigators who support them. METHODS: This clinical case discussion comprises two parts. First, a discussion on the impact that COVID-19 pandemic management has had on one person with an intellectual disability is framed using intersecting notions of cumulative complexity and Burden of Treatment Theory. Following, through a Latourian lens, the role of the Disability Nurse Navigator is explored. FINDINGS: During COVID-19, telehealth has proved an important tool for healthcare continuity. Yet, for some people with some disabilities who live with additional and cumulative layers of health and social complexity, the healthcare workload that is transferred to them is exacerbated as they try to interact with disabling infrastructure. DISCUSSION: The Disability Nurse Navigator recognises that people with disability are not independent of the technologies and structures that make up the healthcare system but that they are mutually constitutive. The Disability Nurse Navigator thus works to stabilise the relationships between changed service provision and the healthcare workload and capacity of people with disability. CONCLUSION: The work of the Disability Nurse Navigator ultimately mitigated the disruption and additional treatment burden that is transferred to people with disability because of unintended consequences arising from the rapid introduction of service change.","output":"Case study discussion: The important partnership role of Disability Nurse Navigators in the context of abrupt system changes because of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a highly pathogenic novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 emerged from Wuhan, China and led to a global pandemic.

To determine the accomplishment of the 10 deliverables for the CF program eHealth and to contribute to the theory and practice of formative evaluation of eHealth in general, a comprehensive evaluation was deemed essential. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to evaluate whether the 10 deliverables of the CF program eHealth were accomplished. The second aim is to evaluate the progress of the 29 eHealth projects to determine the barriers to and facilitators of the development of the CF program eHealth projects. METHODS: To achieve the first aim of this study, an evaluation study was carried out using an adapted version of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization framework. A mixed methods study, consisting of a 2-part questionnaire and semistructured interviews, was conducted to analyze the second aim of the study. RESULTS: The 10 deliverables of the CF program eHealth were successfully achieved. The program yielded 22 tangible eHealth solutions, and significant knowledge on the development and use of eHealth solutions. We have learned that the patient is enthusiastic about accessing and downloading their own medical data but the physicians are more cautious. It was not always possible to implement the Dutch set of standards for interoperability, owing to a lack of information technology (IT) capacities. In addition, more attention needed to be paid to patients with low eHealth skills, and education in such cases is important. The eHealth projects progress aspects such as planning, IT services, and legal played an important role in the success of the 29 projects. The in-depth interviews illustrated that a novel eHealth solution should fulfill a need, that partners already having the knowledge and means to accelerate development should be involved, that clear communication with IT developers and other stakeholders is crucial, and that having a dedicated project leader with sufficient time is of utmost importance for the success of a project.

Piglets with low (A?) or high (A+) MDNA levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated (V+) or not (V?) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 3 weeks of age (woa). Because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in A?V+ piglets post-vaccination (pv), all V+ piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa. Five weeks (W5) pv, piglets were inoculated with a PRRSV-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection, and were mingled 24 h later with non-inoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission. Vaccine strain was detected at W2 pv in 69% and 6% of A?V+ and A+V+ piglets, and at W5 pv in 50% and 25% of A?V+ and A+V+ piglets, respectively. At W5 pv, 94% of A?V+ and 44% of A+V+ piglets seroconverted, with a significant IFNg response induction in the A?V+ group only. After challenge, compared to the V? inoculated group, viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in A?V+ whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in A+V+ piglets.

Investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between IFNa levels and vaccine strain detection in A?V+ piglets.

Microcirculation-guided resuscitation resulted in an increase of 0.49 mm-1 in the De Backer score (p < 0.001), an increase of 2.28% in the Consensus PPV (p < 0.001), and an increase of 2.26% in the Consensus PPV (small) (p < 0.001) for every 30 min of additional intraoperative time. All microcirculation variables were negatively correlated with v-aPCO2 (rho = - 0.656, adj-p < 0.001; rho = - 0.623; adj-p < 0.001; rho = - 0.597, adj-p < 0.001, respectively) at each intraoperative time point. Lactate levels were negatively correlated with Consensus PPV (rho = - 0.464; adj-p = 0.002) and Consensus PPV (small) (rho = - 0.391, adj-p < 0.001). Survival at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year were 76.9%, 76.9%, and 61.5%, respectively.

However, previous studies in this area mostly focused on infection before May 2020 and long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 incidence across four case surges from 03/1/2020 to 02/28/2021. METHODS: The cohort included 4.6 million members from a large integrated health care system in southern California with comprehensive electronic medical records (EMR). COVID-19 cases were identified from EMR. Incidence of COVID-19 was computed at the census tract-level among members. Prior 1-month and 1-year averaged air pollutant levels (PM(2.5), NO(2), and O(3)) at the census tract-level were estimated based on hourly and daily air quality data. Data analyses were conducted by each wave: 3/1/2020C5/31/2020, 6/1/202C9/30/2020, 10/1/2020C12/31/2020, and 1/1/2021C2/28/2021 and pooled across waves using meta-analysis. Generalized linear mixed effects models with Poisson distribution and spatial autocorrelation were used with adjustment for meteorological factors and census tract-level social and health characteristics. Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) per 1 standard deviation. RESULTS: The cohort included 446,440 COVID-19 cases covering 4609 census tracts. The pooled RRs (95% CI) of COVID-19 incidence associated with 1-year exposures to PM(2.5), NO(2), and O(3) were 1.11 (1.04, 1.18) per 2.3 g/m(3),1.09 (1.02, 1.17) per 3.2 ppb, and 1.06 (1.00, 1.12) per 5.5 ppb respectively. The corresponding RRs (95% CI) associated with prior 1-month exposures were 1.11 (1.03, 1.20) per 5.2 g/m(3) for PM(2.5), 1.09 (1.01, 1.17) per 6.0 ppb for NO(2) and 0.96 (0.85, 1.08) per 12.0 ppb for O(3). CONCLUSION: Long-term PM(2.5) and NO(2) exposures were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 incidence across all case surges before February 2021. Short-term PM(2.5) and NO(2) exposures were also associated. Our findings suggest that air pollution may play a role in increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Ambient air pollution and COVID-19 incidence during four 2020C2021 case surges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Respiratory activities such as sneezing generate pathogen laden droplets that can deposit in the respiratory tract of a susceptible host to initiate infection.

This method of visualization provides images that clearly resolve the velocities of droplets with minimal overlapping trajectories, towards understanding their flow dynamics. Furthermore, we present the image processing techniques required to perform accurate Particle Tracking Velocimetry to understand the motion of expelled droplets. Flow fields are presented from applying this methodology over multiple sneezes which reveal that less than 1% of droplets expelled travel at velocities greater than 10 m/s and almost 80% of droplets travel at velocities less than 5 m/s.

We aimed to develop PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment), a machine learning-based forecasting tool to predict future overdose deaths at the census block group (i.e., neighbourhood) level. DESIGN Randomised, population-based, community intervention trial. SETTING Rhode Island, USA. PARTICIPANTS All persons who reside in Rhode Island during the study period may contribute data to either the model or the trial outcomes. INTERVENTION Each of the state's 39 municipalities will be randomised to the intervention (PROVIDENT) or comparator condition. An interactive, web-based tool will be developed to visualize the PROVIDENT model predictions. Municipalities assigned to the treatment arm will receive neighbourhood risk predictions from the PROVIDENT model, and state agencies and community-based organizations will direct resources to neighbourhoods identified as high risk. Municipalities assigned to the control arm will continue to receive surveillance information and overdose prevention resources, but they will not receive neighbourhood risk predictions. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome is the municipal-level rate of fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses. Fatal overdoses will be defined as unintentional drug-related death; non-fatal overdoses will be defined as an emergency department visit for a suspected overdose reported through the state's syndromic surveillance system. Intervention efficacy will be assessed using Poisson or negative binomial regression to estimate incidence rate ratios comparing fatal and non-fatal overdose rates in treatment vs. control municipalities. COMMENTS The findings will inform the utility of predictive modelling as a tool to improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services.","output":"Preventing overdose using information and data from the environment (PROVIDENT): Protocol for a randomised, population-based, community intervention trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a short span of a few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world like no other event in modern history.

This study aimed to detect and explain the efficacy of reusing of these drugs in treating COVID\\\\19. METHODS: The study was divided into two parts: clinical and computational parts. In the clinical part, 80 (30 females) subjects with reverse transcription\\\\polymerase chain reaction\\\\confirmed COVID\\\\19 with mild and moderate symptoms were enrolled in the study. Subjects were treated with azithromycin or doxycycline, and nitazoxanide was added to the treatment if the subject had diarrhoea. Subjects were divided into four groups: Group 1: subjects treated with azithromycin (20 subjects); Group 2: subjects treated with doxycycline (20 subjects); Group 3: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and doxycycline (20 subjects); and Group 4: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and azithromycin (20 subjects). In the computational part, we docked the three drugs against all currently available COVID\\\\19\\\\related protein targets (viral and non\\\\viral). Subsequently, top hits were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations (MDSs) (50 ns) and binding free energy calculations to further validate the docking experiments and to investigate the binding modes of the potential inhibitors. RESULTS: The symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was seen on the fifth day after starting treatment in Group 3 and Group 4 and on the seventh day in Group 2. However, for Group 1, the symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was not seen on the fifth day and required replacement by doxycycline to get the symptomatic improvement. None of the subjects needed intensive care admission and no deaths were reported. In silico, results were in good accordance with the clinical outcomes, where both nitazoxanide and doxycycline achieved the best docking scores against the viral ADP\\\\ribose phosphatase (ADPRP) and the human Adaptor\\\\Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1). MDSs revealed that both drugs were stable in their bindings indicating that they can be considered as lead molecules for targeting ADPRP and AAK1.

geoengineering, cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight, could be deployed temporarily to shave the peak of global temperatures. This would use limited deployment to keep global mean temperatures below a given threshold, buying time for emissions reductions and negative emissions to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. However, we suggest the trade-offs inherent in such scenarios are not widely appreciated. In this study, we explore general features of such scenarios, using a combination of simple analytical relationships between emissions and temperatures and modelling to illustrate the strong trade-off between the duration of geoengineering deployment and the temperature overshoot that is suppressed by geoengineering, as well as the scale of negative emissions that are required. Our results indicate that, unless climate sensitivity is at the high end of estimates, shaving a substantial peak, say, of 2K to 1.5K, would require at least a century of deployment of solar geoengineering and large-scale negative emissions, under a broad range of emissions trajectories. If negative emissions are not available at the scale of tens of gigatonnes of C02 per year, substantial peak-shaving will require deployment of geoengineering for multiple centuries. Our analysis emphasise the importance of factoring in the scale, feasibility, and cost of the negative emissions required to avoid indefinite commitment to solar geoengineering.","output":"Tradeoffs inherent in solar geoengineering peak-shaving strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An important consideration in the commercialization of cell-based meat, poultry, and seafood is what common or usual name to use on package labels to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. However, naming these products has been the subject of considerable debate. This study used a 3  10 between-subjects online experiment involving a quota sample of 3,186 U.S. adult panel participants to test common or usual names using images of realistic packages of three types of seafood that a consumer might encounter in a supermarket. The terms tested were, \\"cell-based seafood,\\" \\"cell-cultured seafood,\\" \\"cultivated seafood,\\" and \\"cultured seafood\\" and the phrases, \\"produced using cellular aquaculture,\\" \\"cultivated from the cells of ____,\\" and \\"grown directly from the cells of ____,\\" where the blanks are filled by the name of the seafood product. Five criteria were used for evaluation, including each term's ability to: enable consumers to distinguish cell-based seafood from wild and farmed fish, to signal potential allergenicity, be seen by consumers as an appropriate term to identify the product, not disparage either cell-based or conventional products, and not evoke thoughts, images, or emotions that are inconsistent with the idea that the products are safe, healthy, and nutritious. The results showed that \\"cell-based seafood\\" outperforms the other names tested. It enables consumers to recognize that the products are neither wild caught nor farm raised, signals potential allergenicity, is seen as an appropriate name for describing the technology/process, and it performs well with respect to measures of consumer acceptance, particularly in comparison to conventional products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Creating consensus around a single common or usual name for cell-based meat, poultry, and seafood products is clearly important both for regulatory reasons and for shaping public perceptions and understanding of the products that are labeled with it. Our findings suggest that \\"cell-based\\" is the best common or usual name for seafood products that both meets FDA regulatory requirements and performs well with respect to potential consumer acceptance.

Intensified chemotherapy regimens have increased the probability of converting unresectable metastasis to resectable. Here, we report the result of combining intensive chemotherapy (triplet) and surgical resection of metastatic lesions in patients with metastatic CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with unresectable metastatic CRC were enrolled in phase I/II trial of triplet chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. Patients were given 5-8 cycles induction chemotherapy of the above regimen followed by maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request. All patients were assessed at a multidisciplinary conference for possible surgical resection of their metastatic disease at the time of inclusion in the trial and 2 monthly intervals thereafter. Patients who underwent R0 resection of their metastatic disease received adjuvant oxaliplatin and capecitabine to complete a total of 6 months of chemotherapy. RESULTS Fifty-three patients were enrolled. The median age was 52 years (range 23-74), 29 (55%) were males, ECOG PS 0-1 was 13 (66%), 11 (42%) had a right-sided tumor, 29 (55%) had resection of their primary tumor, 22 (42%) had a single metastatic site, and 8 (15.1%) had a liver-limited disease. Thirteen patients (24.5%) underwent surgical resection of residual metastatic disease +/- the primary tumor with 10 (18.9%) of them were R0. The surgical group had a higher incidence of males compared to the non-surgical group (69.3% vs 47.2%, p = 0.2), equal performance status, lower median number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2, p = 0.09), higher mutant Kras (53.8% vs 34.2%, p = 0.3), and higher response rate (84.6% vs 56.2%, p = 0.3). With a median follow-up duration of 89 months, the median PFS for the whole group was 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-20] and the median OS was 28.2 months (95% CI 22.5-53.3). The median PFS for the surgery group was 18.9 months (95% CI 12.6-not reached) compared to 9.6 months (95% CI 7.0-18.3) for the non-surgical group, log-rank p = 0.0165.

Estimation results show that when PITI increases by 1 unit, the probability of improving the self-reported health level and actual health level of middle-aged and old residents increases by 1 and 0.87%, respectively. The impact of environmental information disclosure on the health of middle-aged and old residents also has significant regional heterogeneity. Specifically, the impact is mainly reflected in the central region of China. Conclusion: Environmental information disclosure can improve the health of middle-aged and old residents. To improve the health of middle-aged and old residents, it is necessary to implement and enhance the environmental information disclosure system continuously. The anti-driving effect of environmental information disclosure on the treatment of environmental pollution must be intensified further, particularly focusing on the central region of China, where is more polluted and more concentrated than other regions.","output":"Does Environmental Information Disclosure Improve the Health Level of Middle-Aged and Old Residents?

Especially after the outbreak of the COVID-19, people head to the virtual world by shopping online instead of going to the actual store, watching movies on platforms like Netflix instead of going to cinemas, or companies are applying different methods to continue their internal operations online. So most companies now invest much effort to enhance their online platforms to cope with the occurring situation. One way of enhancing the online system, especially in E-commerce, E-learning, and entertainment platforms, is by building robust recommendation algorithms. Recommender systems play a massive role in improving the online experience by suggesting to the user relevant items. However, treating all users the same by applying recommendation strategies that do not include the user her-/himself as the center of the algorithm may lead to an unpleasant user experience as each user has a different personality, taste, and different needs. Thus, in this paper, a structured review of the efforts invested in creating personalized recommendation systems is studied to explore the personal factors included in previous trials. Accordingly, we propose XReC, a generic framework for building character-based recommender systems based on Character Computing principles, including all the aspects that influence human behavior. As a result of integrating multiple human aspects, the systems complexity will arise. A personalized explanation accompanying each recommendation is provided to improve our frameworks transparency, trustworthiness, persuasiveness, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"XReC: Towards a Generic Module-Based Framework for Explainable Recommendation Based on Character"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tibial avulsion fractures in children are extremely rare. Due to the rarity of these injuries, careful attention to the specific physical examination and imaging findings is necessary for a proper diagnosis. PCL avulsion fractures can be missed on plain radiography in skeletally immature patients. Magnetic resonance imaging should be considered if sagging or posterior drawer sign is positive after a strong hit to the anterior aspect of the lower leg. With this knowledge, clinicians can formulate treatment plans that can return patients to their original functionality while avoiding potential morbidity from misdiagnoses. We treated these patients using the suture bridge method. In children, ossification is incomplete, and they possess a lot of cartilage, so screw fixation easily destroys avulsed fragment. The suture bridge method can firmly fix the avulsed fragments, reducing the risk of damage to the bone fragment; therefore, a secondary surgery for implant removal is not needed. Arthroscopic surgery also was expected to be technically difficult in children due to the limited scope of the operation. We used open fixation because the outcome was unaffected by open surgery and arthroscopic surgery, and all patients returned to full sporting activity postoperatively.","output":"Suture Bridge Fixation for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tibial Avulsion Fracture in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries imposed lockdowns on their citizens in an attempt to contain the disease. Pakistan is one of these countries. A government mandated lockdown can have mitigating psychological effects on young adults, out of which a large fraction is made up of students. This study aims to investigate the correlations between changes in sleep pattern, perception of time, and digital media usage. Furthermore, it explores the impact of these changes on the mental health of students of different educational levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire, from March 24 to April 26, 2020. The survey was targeted at students and 251 responses were obtained. It was a 5-section long questionnaire. The first section inquired about demographics of participants. Each of the other 4 section were devoted to changes in sleep pattern, perception of time flow, digital media usage and mental health status of students. Close ended questions with multiple choice responses, dichotomous, interval and 4-point Likert scales were used in the construction of the survey questionnaire. Chi square, T-tests multinomial and binary logistic regression were used as primary statistical tests. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results: Out of 251 adolescents that participated in our study, the majority (70.2%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 19.40+/- 1.62 years. Two-thirds of the respondents did not have much trouble falling asleep (66.5%). The analysis found no significant association between longer sleep periods and procrastination level (p = 0.054). Nearly three-fourths (72.9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets. Of these, a majority (85.8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0.023). Additionally, a large number of students (69.7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster. A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0.005). With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0.021 and p = 0.004, respectively). Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the median difference of time spent on social media before the outbreak (3.0+/-32.46) and time spent on social media after the outbreak (6.0+/-3.52) in a single day (p=0.000). Conclusions: Our research has revealed that due to the lockdown imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, the sleeping patterns of the students was affected the most. Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness. A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable. All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown. Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on lifestyle and mental health of students: A retrospective study from Karachi,Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a retrospective analysis of the available articles on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) published since the outbreak of the disease.

The aim of this study was to identify and describe the etiological agents associated with acute respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years old, and their associated risk factors, such as clinical symptoms or socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: Naso-pharyngeal samples were collected from children under 5 years attending at Dr. Agostinho Neto Hospital (Praia, Santiago Island, Cabo Verde) with suspected ARI at different time-points during 2019. Samples were analyzed using FilmArray? Respiratory Panel v. 2.0 Plus to identify etiological agents of ARI. A questionnaire with socio-demographic information was also collected for each participant. Data analyses were carried out using the IBM SPSS version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and R 3.5.1 statistical software. Results: A total of 129 naso-pharyngeal samples were included in the study. Seventeen different etiologic agents of respiratory infections were identified.

This emergency situation led to a sudden and compulsory shift from the office to home, forcing the adoption of teleworking from home by people and organizations who had little or no experience with this type of workstyle modality. Also, important phases such as planning and resourcing workers and managers may have been passed over with minimal or no attention. This paper aims to raise and discuss experiences on the adoption of remote work during COVID-19 and issues that should be addressed to avoid possible negative outcomes. Experiences in the adoption of telework during the pandemic show consequences already discussed by the literature, like work-family conflict, but under specific circumstances, such as the closure of schools and daycare centers. Excess workload and technology invasion are also reported as difficulties of remote work in this scenario. Using a macroergonomic model, we address issues that should be verified to overcome these challenges, at different levels, considering factors related to the organizational, personnel, and technological subsystems, and the external environment. The use of a macroergonomic model intends to consider aspects from diverse areas that could influence individual, group, or organizational desired outcomes. The consequences of sudden and enforced remote work during COVID-19 reinforce the importance of planning and accompanying telework comprehensively. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"COVID-19 and Teleworking from Home: Understanding New Issues from a Macroergonomic Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Computational antibody engineering, affinity maturation, and screening greatly aid in vaccine and therapeutic antibody development by increasing the speed and accuracy of predictions. This study presents a protocol for designing affinity enhancing mutants of antibodies through in silico mutagenesis. A SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive neutralizing antibody, CR3022, is considered as a case study. Methods: : Our study aimed at generating antibody candidates from the human antibody CR3022 (derived from convalescent SARS patient) against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 via in silico affinity maturation using site-directed mutagenesis in mutation hotspots. We optimized the paratope of the CR3022 antibody towards the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for better binding affinity and stability, employing molecular modeling, docking, dynamics simulations, and molecular mechanics energies combined with generalized Born and surface area (MM-GBSA). Results: : Nine antibody candidates were generated post in silico site-directed mutagenesis followed by preliminary screening. Molecular dynamics simulation of 100 nanoseconds and MM-GBSA analysis confirmed L-K45S as a lead antibody with the highest binding affinity against the RBD compared to wild-type and mutant counterparts. Three out of the remaining mutants were also found to have distinct epitopes and binding, possessing a potential to be developed against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the use of an integrative antibody engineering protocol for enhancing affinity and neutralization potential through mutagenesis using robust open-source computational tools and predictors. This study highlights unique scoring and ranking methods for evaluating docking efficiency. It also underscores the importance of framework mutations for developing broadly neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Affinity maturation of cross-reactive CR3022 antibody against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 via in silico site-directed mutagenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe B.1.526 variant (WHO designation: Iota) is a SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest, as classified by both the US CDC and the WHO. Due to a lack of extensive genomic sequencing and contact tracing data, its key epidemiological properties have not been well characterized. MethodsWe utilized nine epidemiological and population datasets collected in New York City (NYC), where B.1.526 emerged, and comprehensive modeling to estimate the changes in transmissibility, immune escape potential, and infection fatality risk (IFR) for B.1.526. FindingsEstimated transmission rate in the neighborhood where B.1.526 was initially detected was consistently higher than other neighborhoods in NYC and further increased during the weeks preceding B.1.526 detection, likely due to its early spread there. Overall, models estimated that B.1.526 had transmissibility about 15-25% higher than previously circulating variants and that it could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected persons. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased IFR in older adults: by 46% (95% CI: 7.4 - 84%) among 45-64 year-olds, 82% (95% CI: 20 - 140%) among 65-74 year-olds, and 62% (95% CI: 45 - 80%) among 75+ during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline IFR estimated for preexisting variants. InterpretationNew variants like B.1.526 likely spread in the population weeks prior to detection, and partial immune escape (e.g., resistance to therapeutic antibodies) could offset prior medical advances and increase IFR. Early preparedness for and close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants, their epidemiological characteristics, and disease severity are thus crucial to COVID-19 pandemic response as it remains a global public health threat. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published through June 23, 2021 on the B.1.526 (Iota) SARS-CoV-2 variant, using the terms \\"B.1.526\\", \\"Iota variant\\" and \\"COVID-19\\", or \\"Iota variant\\" and \\"SARS-CoV-2\\". Our search returned 14 papers, from which we read the abstracts and identified 8 relevant studies. The majority (7 of 8) of these studies focused on identifying the specific mutations, namely L5F, T95I, D253G, additionally E484K or S477N for two different subclades (i.e., B.1.526-S:E484K and B.1.526-S:S477N) and a closely related subclade (i.e., B.1.526-S:L452R or B.1.526.1) as defined by spike mutations D80G, {Delta}144, F157S, L452R, T859N, and D950H; these studies also examined changes in neutralizing ability of convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera (mild reductions by [~]2-4 fold were reported) and changes in neutralizing ability of monoclonal antibodies (substantial reductions for some monoclonal antibodies were reported). Two studies used genomic data from GISAID to estimate the growth rate of B.1.526 during January - March 2021 and reported that it was similar to the Alpha variant (i.e., B.1.1.7), a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern with around 50% higher transmissibility than preexisting variants. However, an epidemiological study using individual patient data from January 1 to April 5, 2021 reported no increases in secondary attack rate among contacts of B.1.526 cases, compared to non-VOC/VOI variants. This latter study also showed preliminary evidence that B.1.526 did not increase the risk of hospitalization or death, nor of vaccine breakthrough or reinfection. Added value of this studyWe utilized multiple datasets collected in New York City - where B.1.526 emerged - and model-inference methods to reconstruct the transmission dynamics, including the initial emergence of B.1.526 in the fall of 2020. We estimated that B.1.526 had a moderate increase (15-25%) in transmissibility and could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected individuals. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased the infection-fatality risk (IFR) among adults 65 or older by >60% during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline risk estimated for preexisting variants. Implications of all the available evidenceNew SARS-CoV-2 variants like B.1.526 could increase transmissibility, evade prior immunity, and increase disease severity.

METHODS: An echocardiographic examination was performed within 72 h from admission in 64 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in our medium-intensity care unit, from March 30th to May 15th 2020. Six patients were excluded for inadequate acoustic window. RESULTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients were finally enrolled, with a median age of 58 years. Twenty-two (38%) were classifiable as severe COVID-19 disease. Eight out of 58 patients experienced adverse evolution (six died, two were admitted to ICU and received mechanical ventilation), all of them in the severe pneumonia group. Severe pneumonia patients showed higher troponin, IL-6 and D-Dimer values. No significant new onset alterations of left and right ventricular systolic function parameters were observed. Patients with severe pneumonia showed higher mean estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) (30.7  5.2 mmHg vs 26.2  4.3 mmHg, p = 0.006), even if in the normality range values. No differences in echocardiographic parameters were retrieved in patients with adverse events with respect to those with favorable clinical course.

METHODS: Three radiology residents with minimal experience in bladder MRI served as readers. They blindly evaluated 200 studies divided into 4 subsets of 50 cases over a 3-month period. After 2 months, the first subset was reassessed, resulting in a total of 250 evaluations. An interactive training program was provided and included educational lessons and case-based practice. The learning curve was constructed by plotting mean agreement as the ratio of correct evaluations per batch. Inter-reader agreement and diagnostic performance analysis were performed with kappa statistics and ROC analysis. RESULTS: As for the VI-RADS scoring agreement, the kappa differences between pre-training and post-training evaluation of the same group of cases were 0.555 to 0.852 for reader 1, 0.522 to 0.695 for reader 2, and 0.481 to 0.794 for reader 3.

In the case of natural disasters the effects on public health can be direct or indirect. Direct effects are defined as those resulting from the immediate destruction such as drowning and trauma from flying debris, while indirect effects are delayed, longer lasting, and, often harder to measure or detect. In the case of outbreaks and epidemics, lack of comprehensive testing or reporting can lead to challenges in measuring direct effects, while indirect effects can arise due to, for example, increased stress levels or reduced access to health services. When the effects are long lasting and difficult to detect in the short term, the accumulated effects can actually be devastating. Improved access to mortality data provides an opportunity to develop data-driven approaches that can help monitor health systems and quantify the effects of natural disasters, epidemics, or outbreaks. Here we describe a statistical methodology and software that facilitates data-driven approaches. Our work was motivated by events occurring in Puerto Rico after the passage of Hurricane Maria, but can be applied in other contexts such as estimating the effects of an epidemic in the presence of inaccurate reporting of cases.

Although effective, parenteral desensitization regimens require use of costly venom extracts and require frequent visits over extended periods of time. OBJECTIVE: Adjuvants are commonly used to enhance the efficacy of infectious disease vaccines, and this study asked whether Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia), a novel noninflammatory polysaccharide adjuvant, might provide similar benefits for allergy desensitization. METHODS: A randomized, controlled phase 1/2 trial was undertaken in 27 adults with a history of rapid-onset systemic allergic reactions to honeybee stings and positive specific IgE levels to evaluate the safety and efficacy of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT) combined with Advax adjuvant. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) was administered monthly for 30 months after achievement of maintenance doses. RESULTS: Advax-adjuvanted HBVIT was well tolerated. Around week 14 of VIT, specific IgG(4) responses peaked in both groups but increased earlier, peaked higher, and were better maintained through the end of the study in the Advax-adjuvanted arm. Several different patterns of serologic response to VIT were seen; some subjects had a dominant IgG(4) response, some had a combined IgG(4) and IgG(1) response, and some had an exclusively IgG(1) response. In some subjects specific IgE levels increased during the induction phase and then decreased, whereas in others specific IgE levels progressively decreased from the start of VIT. CONCLUSION: Advax adjuvant favorably enhanced the immunogenicity of HBVIT, with an early and prolonged switch to specific IgG(4) production. The ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance VIT efficacy warrants further study.","output":"Randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefits of delta inulin adjuvanted immunotherapy in patients with bee venom allergy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Cardiovascular involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and leads to worsened mortality. Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 6417 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST-T wave changes, and initial hs-cTnT &#8805;20 ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs-cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality.

However, concerns have been raised about a possible link between RAAS-blockers and an increased risk of cancer, particularly of lung cancer. This narrative review aims to give a critical appraisal of current evidence and to help physicians understand potential links between RAAS blockade and de novo lung cancer development. METHODS: Numerous pharmaco-epidemiologic studies, mostly retrospective cohort analyses, evaluated the association of RAAS blockade with lung cancer incidence and reported inconsistent findings. Meta-analyses could not further clarify a possible link between RAAS blockade and the risk of lung cancer. RESULTS: International regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) have concluded that the use of RAAS blockers is not associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Co-administration of RAAS blockers to systemic therapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer seems to have positive effects on the outcome. CONCLUSION: Until more comprehensive analyses have been completed, there is no need to change clinical practise. Additional prospective randomized trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of these drugs on the development and progression of lung cancer.","output":"Risk of lung cancer and reninCangiotensin blockade: a concise review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the large-scale industrial production has made mountains of scrapped products and inevitably exerts irreversible damage to the nature resource and environment. Under this real situation, remanufacturing industry is able to provide a new path for government and enterprises to deal with the scrapped products and find the new growth point of ecological economy. So, the problem that how to push forward the development of remanufacturing via the regulations of government has become the focus to the scholars and practitioners of enterprises. In this paper, the evolutionary game model was established in order to analyze the optimal strategies for both the government and the enterprises. Based on the obtained results from evolutionary game model, it shows that when the revenues gotten from supervision activities surpass the costs, government will supervise enterprises production pattern positively. Meanwhile, if the profits earned by polluted production are higher than it in remanufacturing production, enterprises will keep their patter of production, although they may face the penalties of government. Then, a case study based on the long-term perspective was introduced in order to verify the rationality of the game model in math. The result of this paper shows that the regulation of government will exert the significant influences to firms decision about remanufacturing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bioequivalence study of TCP with a wash-out of 1 week between 2 doses of 10 mg TCP was re-analyzed for changes of the plasma concentrations of TCP enantiomers. Plasma concentrations of (+)-TCP and the ratio of (+)-TCP and (-)-TCP plasma concentrations were used as a measure of MAO activity because (+)-TCP is a more effective suicide inhibitor of MAO than (-)-TCP and, therefore considerably more metabolized by MAO. RESULTS: The area under the curve from the first to the last measured concentration (AUCt) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of (+)-TCP increased significantly in the second dose (p < 0.0001) by 43.1% (11.8%) and 66.5% (26.4%), respectively, (mean with 95%CI in each case). The ratios (+)-TCP/(-)-TCP of AUCt and Cmax also increased significantly (p < 0.0001) by 27.3% (6.4%) and 25.9% (6.2%), respectively. No changes were found for the half-lives (T1/2) of both enantiomers. CONCLUSION: For the first dose, MAO is the main drug-metabolizing enzyme of (+)-TCP. MAO activity in the liver and gut is not completely recovered within 1 week after 1 dose of TCP. One week of wash-out may be insufficient in bioequivalence studies of irreversible MAO inhibitors. Prolonged inhibition of MAO after the treatment with irreversible MAO inhibitors may explain drug interactions during the switch from another MAO inhibitor to TCP. Enantiomer plasma concentrations of TCP after a dose of racemic TCP may be used as a test for gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO activity.","output":"Insufficient recovery of monoamine oxidase in a bioequivalence study of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine: Recommendation of the tranylcypromine enantiomer test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical imaging, including chest radiography and computed tomography, plays a major role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS In this study, 1337 consecutive patients with glottic carcinoma who underwent surgical treatment from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The influence of tumor size that was evaluated by tumor area (tumor length  tumor width) on OS and DFS outcomes was assessed by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS In all, 1303 (97.5%) patients were male, and 34 (2.5%) were female, with a mean  SD age of 60.4  10 years. The 10-year OS and DFS rates were 72.9% and 69.9%, respectively.

Aims and Objectives: We aimed at assessing the difference between the severity of COVID-19 illness in patients having concurrent atopic dermatitis compared to those without concurrent atopic dermatitis. Materials and Methods: Study subjects included real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 patients under the age of 18 years. The patients were divided into two groups, namely, cases and controls. Cases included children with atopic dermatitis diagnosed according to revised Hanifin and Rajka criteria with positive COVID-19 RT-PCR report. Controls were age-and sex-matched children from the same center with COVID-19, without atopic dermatitis. Disease severity was compared between the two groups. In addition, the COVID-19 severity was correlated with the SCORAD in the \\"cases\\" group. Results: While assessing the severity of COVID-19 illness on the basis of computed tomography score and clinical severity, there was a higher proportion of \\"severe\\" illness in \\"cases\\" compared to \\"controls,\\" however, the difference was statistically insignificant. There was no significant correlation between high SCORAD scores and severe COVID-19 illness.

The survey included sociodemographic, health behaviours, use of internet and social media, and clinical dental data. The association between the prevalence of caries experience (DMFT  1) and the number of untreated dental decay with use of internet and social media was assessed adjusting for age, gender, country, deprivation, toothbrushing, dental visits and consumption of sugary drinks and food. RESULTS A total of 4414 children were included in the analysis. Children who reported using internet and social media to gain information on oral health had significantly higher odds for caries experience (1.29, 95%CI: 1.03-1.62) in the model adjusting for age, gender and country.

During fusion, the palatal shelves migrate towards the embryonic midline to form a seam. Apoptotic elimination of medial edge epithelium (MEE) cells along this seam is required for the completion of palate fusion. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of six Chinese cleft palate families was applied to identify novel cleft palate-associated gene variants. Palatal fusion and immunofluorescence studies were performed in a murine palatal shelf organ culture model. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting in murine MEE cells during seam formation in vivo. Mechanistic immunoprecipitation studies were performed in murine MEE cells in vitro. RESULTS: WES identified Bcl-2 associated anthanogene 6 (BAG6) as a novel cleft palate-associated gene. In murine MEE cells, we discovered upregulation of Bag6 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) during seam formation in vivo. Using a palatal shelf organ culture model, we demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 enhances MEE cell apoptosis by promoting p300's acetylation of FoxO1, thereby promoting transcription of the pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Subsequent gain- and loss-of-function studies in the organ culture model demonstrated that FasL is required for Bag6/acFoxO1-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/caspase-3 signaling, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Palatal shelf contact was shown to enhance Bag6 nuclear localization and upregulate nuclear acFoxO1 in MEE cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 and p300 co-operatively enhance FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated MEE apoptosis during palate fusion.","output":"The cleft palate candidate gene BAG6 supports FoxO1 acetylation toapromote FasL-mediated apoptosis during palate fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging respiratory virus with high morbidity, which was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO).

Here, the combination of two recent approaches in a single configuration is very promising and can only lead to considerable improvement. We have theoretically analyzed the sensor performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution. To highlight the importance of the new configuration, a comparison was made with two other sensors. One is based on gold nanoparticles incorporated into a host medium; the other is composed of a bimetallic Ag-Au layer in the massive state. The numerical results obtained have been validated and show that the proposed configuration offers better sensitivity (7100 nm\\\\RIU) and good resolution (figure of merit; FOM = 38.88 [Formula: see text] and signal-to-noise ratio; SNR = 0.388).

The ocular adnexa includes all structures and tissues within the orbit except for the eye bulb. In the region of the ocular adnexa, MALT lymphomas represent the most common subtype of lymphoma, accounting for around 8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These lymphomas are often preceded by inflammatory precursor lesions. Either autoantigens or infectious antigens may lead to disease development by functioning as continuous antigenic triggers. This triggering leads to a constitutive activation of the NF-B signaling pathway. The role of antigenic stimulation in the pathogenesis of OAMZL is supported by the detection of somatic mutations (partially with further intraclonal diversity) in their rearranged immunoglobulin V genes; hence, their derivation from germinal-center-experienced B cells, by a restricted IGHV gene usage, and the validation of autoreactivity of the antibodies in selected cases. In the established lymphomas, NF-B activity is further enforced by mutations in various genes regulating NF-B activity (e.g., TNFAIP3, MYD88), as well as recurrent chromosomal translocations affecting NF-B pathway components in a subset of cases. Further pathogenetic mechanisms include mutations in genes of the NOTCH pathway, and of epigenetic regulators. While gene expression and sequencing studies are available, the role of differential methylation of lymphoma cells, the role of micro-RNAs, and the contribution of the microenvironment remain largely unexplored.","output":"The Biology of Ocular Adnexal Marginal Zone Lymphomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) elicits remission of diabetic hyperglycemia in rodent models of type 2 diabetes.

Although the limitation of the assumptions in a well-mixed model is well known, there has been very little research reported in the published literature on the discrepancy of exposure assessments between numerical models which take account of gravitational effects and the well-mixed model. A new Eulerian-type drift-flux model has been developed to simulate particle dispersion and personal exposure in a two-zone geometry, which accounts for the drift velocity resulting from gravitational settling and diffusion. To validate the numerical model, a small-scale chamber was fabricated. The airflow characteristics and particle concentrations were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer. Both simulated airflow and concentration profiles agree well with the experimental results. A strong inhomogeneous concentration was observed experimentally for 10 m aerosols. The computational model was further applied to study a simple hypothetical, yet more realistic scenario. The aim was to explore different levels of exposure predicted by the new model and the well-mixed model. Aerosols are initially uniformly distributed in one zone and subsequently transported and dispersed to an adjacent zone through an opening. Owing to the significant difference in the rates of transport and dispersion between aerosols and gases, inferred from the results, the well-mixed model tends to overpredict the concentration in the source zone, and under-predict the concentration in the exposed zone. The results are very useful to illustrate that the well-mixed assumption must be applied cautiously for exposure assessments as such an ideal condition may not be applied for coarse particles.","output":"Experimental and numerical study on particle distribution in a two-zone chamber"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that began in late December 2019.

The overall diagnostic sensitivities of CLIAs and LFIAs ranged from 54.2 to 56.6% and from 56.3 to 64.3%, respectively. The overall diagnostic specificities of CLIAs and LFIAs ranged from 98.2 to 99.8% and from 97.3 to 99.0%, respectively. In the symptomatic group (n = 321), the positivity rate increased by over 80% in all assays > 14 days after symptom onset. In the asymptomatic group (n = 68), the positivity rate increased by over 80% in all assays > 21 days after initial RT-PCR detection. In LFIAs, negatively interpreted trace bands accounted for the changes in test performance. Most false-positive results were weak or trace reactions and showed negative results in additional sVNT. For six binding antibody assays, the overall agreement percentages ranged from 91.0 to 97.8%. The median inhibition activity of sVNT was significantly higher in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group (50.0% vs. 29.2%; p < 0.0001).

There was a strong positive correlation between the quantitative results of the four binding antibody assays and sVNT with Spearman -values ranging from 0.746 to 0.854. In particular, when using LFIAs, we recommend using more objective interpretable assays or establishing a band interpretation system for each laboratory, accompanied by observer training.

RESULTS: All patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Non-contrast CT chest was performed for all cases; in addition, the correlation between each CT finding and disease severity or the short-term prognosis was reported. The mean age was higher for patients with unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.01). The patchy pattern was the most common, found in 532/910 patients (58.4%), the nodular pattern was the least common 123/910 (13.5%). The diffuse pattern was reported in 124 (13.6%).

However, data regarding persistent cardiac involvement in patients who recovered from COVID-19 are limited. Our goal is to further explore the sustained impact of COVID-19 during follow-up, focusing on the cardiac involvement in the recovered patients. Methods: In this prospective observational follow-up study, we enrolled a total of 40 COVID-19 patients (20 with and 20 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) who were discharged from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for more than 6 months, and 27 patients (13 with and 14 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) were finally included in the analysis. Clinical information including self-reported symptoms, medications, laboratory findings, Short Form 36-item scores, 6-min walk test, clinical events, electrocardiogram assessment, echocardiography measurement, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was collected and analyzed. Results: Among 27 patients finally included, none of patients reported any obvious cardiopulmonary symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of the quality of life and exercise capacity between the patients with and without cardiac injury. No significant abnormalities were detected in electrocardiogram manifestations in both groups, except for nonspecific ST-T changes, premature beats, sinus tachycardia/bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and bundle-branch block. All patients showed normal cardiac structure and function, without any statistical differences between patients with and without cardiac injury by echocardiography. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury exhibited a significantly higher positive proportion in late gadolinium enhancement sequences [7/13 (53.8%) vs. 1/14 (7.1%), p = 0.013], accompanied by the elevation of circulating ST2 level [median (interquartile range) = 16.6 (12.1, 22.5) vs. 12.5 (9.5, 16.7); p = 0.044]. Patients with cardiac injury presented higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, and N-terminal proCB-type natriuretic peptide than those without cardiac injury, although these indexes were within the normal range for all recovered patients at the 6-month follow-up. Among patients with cardiac injury, patients with positive late gadolinium enhancement presented higher cardiac biomarker (high-sensitivity troponin I) and inflammatory factor (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) on admission than the late gadolinium enhancementCnegative subgroup. Conclusions: Our preliminary 6-month follow-up study with a limited number of patients revealed persistent cardiac involvement in 29.6% (8/27) of recovered patients from COVID-19 after discharge.

Early in the pandemic, Australia implemented a comprehensive and responsive set of policy measures to support telehealth. Initially targeted at protecting vulnerable individuals, including health professionals, this rapidly expanded to a \\"whole population\\" approach as the pandemic evolved. This policy response supported health system capacity and community confidence by protecting patients and healthcare providers; creating opportunities for controlled triage, remote assessment and treatment of mild COVID-19 cases; redeploying quarantined or isolated health care workers (HCWs); and maintaining routine and non-COVID healthcare. PURPOSE: This paper provides a review of the literature regarding telephone and video consulting, outlines the pre-COVID background to telehealth implementation in Australia, and describes the national telehealth policy measures instituted in response to COVID-19. Aligned with the existing payment system for out of hospital care, and funded by the national health insurance scheme, a suite of approximately 300 temporary telehealth Medicare-subsidised services were introduced. Response to these initiatives was swift and strong, with 30.01 million services, at a cost of AUD $1.54 billion, claimed in the first six months. FINDINGS: This initiative has been a major policy success, ensuring the safety of healthcare consumers and healthcare workers during a time of great uncertainty, and addressing known financial risks and barriers for health service providers. The risks posed by COVID-19 have radically altered the value proposition of telehealth for patients and clinicians, overcoming many previously encountered barriers to implementation, including willingness of clinicians to adopt telehealth, consumer awareness and demand, and the necessity of learning new ways of conducting safe consultations. However, ensuring the quality of telehealth services is a key ongoing concern. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a preference by policymakers for video consultation, the majority of telehealth consults in Australia were conducted by telephone. The pronounced dominance of telephone item numbers in early utilisation data suggests there are still barriers to video-consultations, and a number of challenges remain before the well-described benefits of telehealth can be fully realised from this policy and investment. Ongoing exposure to a range of clinical, legislative, insurance, educational, regulatory, and interoperability concerns and solutions, driven by necessity, may drive changes in expectations about what is desirable and feasible - among both patients and clinicians.","output":"\\"A decade's worth of work in a matter of days\\": The journey to telehealth for the whole population in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV2 outbreak was announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020.

This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. METHODS: This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8-18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. RESULTS: The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001). The level of S-anxiety in all patients was higher compared to the cut off value.The mean HAD A score was found to be significantly higher in them compared to the parents of healthy individuals (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that children with MS had negative changes in daily life and high anxiety levels during the pandemic. Since MS patients have also psychiatric comorbidities, they may need psychosocial support especially in this period. Besides, establishment of separate health centers to be used during pandemics for children with chronic illnesses such as MS may be recommended to facilitate access to health care.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV2 on the anxiety levels of subjects and on the anxiety and depression levels of their parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ion channels are specialized proteins that enable the movement of charges through otherwise impermeable lipidic membranes.

Design Observational study; secondary analysis of hospitalisation prevalence. Setting Nationwide adult population, Costa Rica. Participants All 3.67 million adults residents in Costa Rica by mid-2021. Public aggregated data of 5978 hospital records from 14th September to 20th October, 2021 and 6.1 million vaccination doses administered. Interventions Vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech (78%) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (22%). Main outcome measures Prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalisations Results Vaccine effectiveness to prevent hospitalisation (VEH) was estimated as 93.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.0 to 93.9) for complete vaccination and 76.7% (CI: 75.0 to 78.3) for single-dose vaccination among adults of all ages. VEH was lower and more uncertain among older adults aged 58 years and above: 92% (CI: 91% to 93%) for those who had received full vaccination and 64% (CI: 58% to 69%) for those who had received partial vaccination. Single-dose VEH declined over time during the study period, especially in the older age group. Estimates were sensitive to possible errors in the population count used to determine the residual number of unvaccinated people in groups with high vaccine coverage. Conclusion The Costa Rican vaccination programme that administered Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are highly effective to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations after the Delta variant had become dominant. Moreover, a single dose is reasonably effective, justifying the continuation of the national policy of postponing the application for the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to accelerate the vaccination and increase the number of people being vaccinated.

However, current federated learning frameworks are polarized towards addressing either the horizontal or vertical separation of data, and tend to overlook the case where both are present. Furthermore, in mainstream horizontal federated learning frameworks, only artificial neural networks are employed to learn the data patterns, which are considered less accurate and interpretable compared to tree-based models on tabular datasets.

A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target.

With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future.

DESIGN: 27 semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Cruess framework of professional socialisation in medicine supported the interpretation of these data. SETTING: Public health hospitals across four Brazilian states (Santa Catarina, S?o Paulo, Cear, Paraba) and County Cork in the South of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven male and female medical junior doctors who had graduated between November 2019 and April 2020. RESULTS: Fourteen Brazilian and 13 Irish junior doctors were interviewed for this study. Entry to clinical practice during the pandemic had a significant impact on factors influencing the professional socialisation of junior doctors. This impact was reflected across the following six thematic areas: lack of preparedness; disrupted trajectory of role adaptation; fewer opportunities for experiential learning; solidarity and isolation; altered interactions with patients; challenges to health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to clinical practice is an important stage in junior doctors professional socialisation and identity formation. The COVID-19 pandemic created the opportunity for medical graduates to enter the workforce earlier than usual. Entering the workforce during this period created a lack of confidence among junior doctors concerning the boundaries of their new role and responsibilities, while simultaneously disrupting their social integration.

Social distancing based on an accurate assessment of the individual risk of severe outcomes could reduce harm even as infection rates accelerate. Methods: An SEIR dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 was created to simulate the disease in the US after October 2020. The model comprised 8 age groups with US-specific contact rates and low- and high-risk sub-groups defined in terms of the risk of a severe outcome determined by relevant comorbidities and a genetic test. Monte Carlo analysis was used to compare quarantine measures applied to at risk persons identified with and without the genetic test. Results: Under the piecemeal social distancing measures currently in place, absent a vaccine the US can expect 114 million symptomatic infections, 4.8 million hospitalisations and 262,000 COVID-19 related deaths. Social distancing based solely on comorbidities with 80% compliance reduces symptomatic infections by between 1.2 and 2.2 million, hospitalisations by between 1.2 and 1.3 million, and deaths by between 71,800 and 80,900. Refining the definition of at risk using a test of single-nucleotide polymorphisms further reduces symptomatic infections by 1.0 to 1.2 million, hospitalisations by 0.4 million and deaths by between 20,500 and 24,100. Conclusions: Models are now available that can accurately predict the likelihood of severe COVID-19 outcomes based on age, sex, comorbidities and polygenetic testing.

The sudden increase in the number of patients and deaths from this novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious challenge to all arenas of health care delivery system. The care of high-time dependent-factor illnesses is essential for the survival of a patient and the need for avoiding impairment of health. The purpose of the review is to highlight that a change in first-aid attitudes can be assumed behind the delay in immediate interventions initiated by first responders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To maintain socially important first aid, the European Resuscitation Council amended its guidelines on first aid, basic life support and made further recommendations at the time of pandemic on first-aid education, too. For effective domestic adaptation, the present overview summarises the most important aspects of guidelines and their supplements and also covers their practical implementations. The main purpose of the change in guidelines is to bring the willingness of the first responders back to the level before the coronavirus pandemic, and to further enhance it with professional educational materials and modern methods.

Furthermore, few of them explored the interrelationship between self-efficacy and social rhythm among college students over time. This study thus aimed to clarify the longitudinal cross-lagged relationship between self-efficacy, social rhythm, and positive mental health among college students. A total of 764 students (627 females, mean age 21.03  0.84 years at T1) participated in a 3-year-long study (T1, T2, T3) and were asked to complete the General Self-Efficacy, the Brief Social Rhythm, and the Positive Mental Health Scales. The results indicate that the development of positive mental health among college students showed an upward trend during those 3 years. There was a significant relationship between positive mental health, social rhythm, and self-efficacy. Positive mental health and social rhythm significantly predicted self-efficacy in the following year. Positive mental health in T2 could predict both T3 social rhythm marginally and T3 self-efficacy significantly. However, T1 social rhythm was not indirectly associated with T3 mental health via T2 self-efficacy, and T1 self-efficacy was not indirectly associated with T3 mental health via T2 social rhythm. This finding clarified the relationship between positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social rhythm, and provided evidence that positive mental health is the basis for self-efficacy and social rhythm among young adults. Therefore, school psychologists in universities should pay close attention to the positive mental health of young adults to form high levels of self-efficacy and social rhythm.","output":"Relationship between self-efficacy, social rhythm, and mental health among college students: a 3-year longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Suicides by any method, plus nonsuicide fatalities from drug self-intoxication (estimated from selected forensically undetermined and accidental deaths), together represent self-injury mortality (SIM)fatalities due to mental disorders or distress SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999C2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification Methods For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends;Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence;and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the nonsuicide SIM component Findings The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4 3% (95% CI: 3 3%, 5 4%;p6 0% increase (p&lt;0 05) Interpretation Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches Injury surveillance and prevention, mental health, and societal well-being are poorly served by the continuing segregation of substance use disorders from other mental disorders in clinical medicine and public health practice Funding This study was partially funded by the National Centre for Injury Prevention and Control, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (R49CE002093) and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (1UM1DA049412C01;1R21DA046521-01A1)","output":"Fatal self-injury in the United States, 1999C2018: Unmasking a national mental health crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the major challenges of the supply chain managers is to select the best suppliers among all possible ones for their business. Although the research on the supplier selection with regards to green, sustainability or resiliency criteria has been contributed by many papers, simultaneous consideration of these criteria in a fuzzy environment is rarely studied. Hence, this study proposes a fuzzy decision framework to investigate the sustainable-resilient supplier selection problem for a real case study of palm oil industry in Malaysia. Firstly, the resilient-based sustainable criteria are localized for the suppliers performance evaluation in palm oil industry of Malaysia. Accordingly, 30 criteria in three different aspects (i.e. general, sustainable and resilient) are determined by statistical tests. Moreover, a hyper-hybrid model with the use of FDEMATEL (fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory), FBWM (fuzzy best worst method), FANP (fuzzy analytical network process) and FIS (fuzzy inference system), simultaneously is developed to employ their merits in an efficient way. In this framework, regarding the outset, the relationships among the criteria/sub-criteria are obtained by FDEMATEL method. Then, initial weights of the criteria/sub-criteria are measured by FBWM method. Next, the final weights of criteria/sub-criteria considering the interrelationships are calculated by FANP. Finally, the performance of the suppliers is evaluated by FIS method. To show the applicability of this hybrid decision-making framework, an industrial case of palm oil in Malaysia is presented. The findings indicate the high performance of the proposed framework in this concept and identify the most important criteria including the cost in general aspects, resource consumption as the most crucial sustainable criterion and agility as the most important resilient criterion.

The estimated background concentration is evaluated by comparing with the confinement period during lockdown imposed due to COVID19 and also by comparing with the observed PM(2.5 )concentration at one of the background stations in Kolkata. The precision of the techniques in estimating the background concentration is also evaluated. The seasonal analysis of estimated background concentration revealed higher background PM2.5 concentration than the regulatory limit in winter and post-monsoon. Further, Indian cities showed much higher background concentration as compared to the locations in other countries. The particulate matter levels in India are therefore proposed to be compared with the other countries only after removing the background concentration from the measured data.

The mathematical model of the POA is presented for use in solving optimization issues. The performance of POA is evaluated on twenty-three objective functions of different unimodal and multimodal types. The optimization results of unimodal functions show the high exploitation ability of POA to approach the optimal solution while the optimization results of multimodal functions indicate the high ability of POA exploration to find the main optimal area of the search space. Moreover, four engineering design issues are employed for estimating the efficacy of the POA in optimizing real-world applications. The findings of POA are compared with eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms to assess its competence in optimization. The simulation results and their analysis show that POA has a better and more competitive performance via striking a proportional balance between exploration and exploitation compared to eight competitor algorithms in providing optimal solutions for optimization problems.","output":"Pelican Optimization Algorithm: A Novel Nature-Inspired Algorithm for Engineering Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The extend of lung disease remains the most important prognostic factor for survival in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and lack of adherence is the main reason for treatment failure. Early detection of deterioration in lung function and optimising adherence are therefore crucial in CF care.

METHODS: This is a multi-centre, randomized, controlled, non-blinded trial aiming to include 402 patients  12 years-of-age with CF. A standard-of-care arm is compared to an arm receiving objective, continuous monitoring of adherence to inhalation therapies, weekly home spirometry using electronic devices with data transmission to patients and caring physicians combined with video-conferencing, a self-management app and professional telephone coaching. The duration of the intervention phase is 18 months. The primary endpoint is time to the first protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation. Secondary outcome measures include number of and time between pulmonary exacerbations, adherence to inhalation therapy, changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s from baseline, number of hospital admissions, and changes in health-related quality of life. CF-associated medical treatment and care, and health care related costs will be assessed by explorative analysis in both arms.

This meant massive restraints for the population. Objectives: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? Methods: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individuals intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1C7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. Results: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p &lt; 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (?R 2 = 0.002). Discussion: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews.

Although HPRS-16/Att was the first commercially available vaccine, it never became widely used and was soon replaced by the FC126 strain of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) vaccine developed by Witter and associates at the Regional Poultry Research Laboratory (now Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory [ADOL]) in East Lansing, MI. Ironically, Kawamura et al. isolated a herpesvirus from kidney cell cultures from turkeys in 1969 but never realized its potential as a vaccine against MD. Rispens of the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) developed the third vaccine. His associate, Maas, had found commercial flocks of chickens with MDV antibodies but without MD. Subsequently, Rispens isolated a very low pathogenic strain from hen number 988 from his MD antibody-positive flock, which was free of avian leukosis virus and clinical MD. This isolate became the CVI-988 vaccine used mostly in The Netherlands. During the late 1970s, HVT was no longer fully protective against some new emerging field strains. The addition of SB-1, isolated by Schat and Calnek, to HVT improved protection against the emerging very virulent strains. In the 1990s CVI-988 became the worldwide vaccine gold standard.

In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with an IC(50) of 599 ng/L, 108 g/L, 177 ng/L, and 586 g/L respectively. The low serum bioavailability of intranasally administered UFH, along with data suggesting that the nasal epithelium is a portal for initial infection and transmission, suggest that intranasal administration of UFH may be an effective and safe prophylactic treatment.","output":"Effective Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Heparin and Enoxaparin Derivatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and mortality reduction. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this article is to review the existing vaccine injury compensation programs in different countries. The review also highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods : Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We have identified 27 countries operating vaccine injury compensation programs. In Canada, Quebec is the only province with a scheme; however, discussions are ongoing in Canada for nationwide implementation in light of COVID 19. Study limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.","output":"Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smell loss is important for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) screening and diagnosis.

We interviewed 80 college students (aged 18C23) living in the American Northeast and Midwest before (September 2019CFebruary 2020) and during (JuneCJuly 2020) the pandemic to analyze how they make sense of crises, respond to challenges, and project themselves into the future. We compare privileged upper-middle class youth who have families with more resources to buffer themselves against growing uncertainty, with less privileged youth from lower-middle and working class families. Efforts to achieve a sense of dignity, agency, and hope amidst widespread uncertainty illuminate opportunities and constraints in the process of building social resilience, which take different temporal forms across the two class groups given their experiences and resources.","output":"How American college students understand social resilience and navigate towards the future during covid and the movement for racial justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Age\\\\related changes in human T\\\\cell populations are important contributors to immunosenescence.

I argue that virtual specialist-patient interaction challenges clinical reasoning and clinical judgement (clinical reasoning combined with statistical reasoning). However, clinical reasoning can improve by recognising the abductive, deductive, and inductive methods that the clinician employs. Abductive reasoning leading to an inference to the best explanation or invention of an explanatory hypothesis is the default response to unfamiliar or confusing situations. Deductive reasoning supports a previously established goal, but deductive accuracy requires sound premises leading to a valid conclusion. Inductive reasoning uses efficient data sorting, data interpretation, and plan creation without a previously established goal, and allows assessing inferential accuracy over time. In all cases, communication remains the backbone of the clinical encounter. Virtual care for CCD challenges clinical judgement by reducing available information, so even experienced specialists who use induction might default to deduction or abduction. The visit might shorten, decreasing narrative competence and in-turn management quality. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters can be enhanced by allowing sufficient time, employing allied health staff, using an advance script, avoiding dogmatic commitment to either virtual or in-person encounters, special training in virtual care, and conscious awareness of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning processes. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters especially calls for Gestalt cognition to assess a situational pattern irreducible to its parts and independent of its particulars, so that efficient data interpretation and self-reflection are enabled. Gestalt cognition integrates abduction, deduction, and induction, appropriately divides the time and effort spent on each, and can compensate for reduced available information. Evaluating one's clinical judgement for those components especially vulnerable to compromise can help optimize the delivery of virtual care for patients with CCD.","output":"Enhancing clinical judgement in virtual care for complex chronic disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hardware platforms in high performance computing are constantly getting more complex to handle even when considering multicore CPUs alone.

We aim to evaluate neurosurgical practice patterns as well as perioperative incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients and their outcomes. Methods A retrospective review of neurosurgical and neurointerventional cases at two tertiary centers during the first three months of the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic (March 8-June 8) as well as following three months (post-peak pandemic; June 9-September 9) was performed. Baseline characteristics, perioperative COVID-19 test results, modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results 652 neurosurgical and 217 neurointerventional cases were performed during post-peak pandemic period. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, functional/pain, cranioplasty, and cerebral angiogram cases were significantly increased in the post-pandemic period. There was a 2.9% (35/1,197) positivity rate for COVID-19 testing overall and 3.6% (13/363) positivity rate postoperatively. Age, mMeNTS score, complications, length of stay, case acuity, ASA status, length of stay, and disposition were significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Conclusion A significant increase in elective case volume during the post-peak pandemic period is feasible with low and acceptable incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients. COVID-19 positive patients were younger, less likely to undergo elective procedures, had increased length of stay, had more complications, and were discharged to a location other than home.

What are the top metadata categories in use? How did they grow over time? What purpose do they serve? We also recognize that not all metadata fields are used equally. What is the growth of individual fields over time? Which fields experienced the fastest adoption?

Upon reviewing the metadata fields in each article, we discovered that 2010 began a metadata renaissance as publishers embraced metadata for improved search engine ranking, search engine tracking, social media tracking, and social media sharing. When analyzing individual fields, we find that one application of metadata stands out above all others: social cards -- the cards generated by platforms like Twitter when one shares a URL. Once a metadata standard was established for cards in 2010, its fields were adopted by 20% of articles in the first year and reached more than 95% adoption by 2016.

A new dataset was collected during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We demonstrate two models: the Traditional Arabic Language (TAL) model and the Semantic Partitioning Arabic Language (SPAL) model to envisage the polarity of the collected tweets by invoking several, well-known classifiers. The extraction and allocation of numerous Arabic features, such as lexical features, writing style features, grammatical features, and emotional features, have been used to analyze and classify the collected tweets semantically. The partitioning concept was performed on the original dataset by utilizing the hidden semantic meaning between tweets in the SPAL model before invoking various classifiers. The experimentation reveals that the overall performance of the SPAL model competes over and better than the performance of the TAL model due to imposing the genuine idea of semantic partitioning on the collected dataset.","output":"Semantic Partitioning and Machine Learning in Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Single-port access laparoscopic surgery (SPALS) is supposed to simplify and improve the outcomes of current multiport laparoscopic procedures. This retrospective study was performed to assess the actual outcomes of SPALS in 2 simple gynecological oncology procedures, namely, diagnostic laparoscopy and bilateral adnexectomy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective monocentric study. Case files of only those women who underwent bilateral adnexectomies and diagnostic and/or staging laparoscopy were studied with respect to the operative room time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative pain, and lengths of hospital stays. The main objective was to assess the feasibility and utility of SPALS surgery in gynecology. The secondary objective was to compare this group with a cohort of patients with multiport conventional laparoscopic surgery (MPCLS) performed during the same period. RESULTS From December 2009 to March 2013, there were 134 patients who underwent these 2 procedures. Eighty adnexectomies were performed, 41 by SPALS and 39 by MPCLS. Fifty-four diagnostic laparoscopies were performed, with 27 patients in each group. In the group of adnexectomies, operative time was significantly lower in SPALS compared with MPCLS (36 vs 59 minutes, P < 10) and also compared with the postoperative stay (1 vs 2.2 nights, P < 10). By contrast, no significant difference was observed between the 2 methods of access in all the parameters studied in the group of diagnostic laparoscopies. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrates that SPALS is feasible and safe for simple gynecological procedures. This approach may result in a smooth postoperative course and shorter hospital stay and can thus be promoted to a day care procedure.","output":"Single-port access laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic oncology: outcomes and feasibility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 produces two long viral protein precursors from one open reading frame using a highly conserved RNA pseudoknot that enhances programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.

The aim of the study was to predict the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, using a score based on LUS findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to Niguarda hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia during the period of a month, from March 2nd to April 3rd 2020. Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected. LUS was performed in all patients. The chest was divided into 12 areas. The LUS report was drafted using a score from 0 to 3 with 0 corresponding to A pattern, 1 corresponding to well separated vertical artifacts (B lines), 2 corresponding to white lung and small consolidations, 3 corresponding to wide consolidations. The total score results from the sum of the scores for each area. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation, no active further management, or death. The secondary outcome was discharge from the emergency room (ER). RESULTS: 255 patients were enrolled. 93.7a% had a positive LUS.aETI was performed in 43 patients, and 24 received a DNI order. The general mortality rate was 15.7a%. Male sex (OR 3.04, pa=a0.014), cardiovascular disease and hypertension (OR 2.75, pa=a0.006), P/F (OR 0.99, pa<a0.001) and an LUS score >a20 (OR 2.52, pa=a0.046) were independent risk factors associated with the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for an LUS score >a20 was performed with an AUC of 0.837. Independent risk factors associated with the secondary outcome were age (OR 0.96, pa=a0.073), BMI (OR 0.87, pa=a0,13), P/F (OR 1.03, pa<a0.001), and LUS score <a10 (OR 20.9, pa=a0.006). ROC curve analysis was performed using an LUS score <a10 with an AUC 0.967. CONCLUSION: The extent of lung abnormalities evaluated by LUS score is a predictor of a worse outcome, ETI, or death.

HPV E6, E7 are two main papillomavirus oncoproteins, closely relate to the function of HPV immortalization, cell transformation, and carcinogenesis. L1 is the major capsid protein, can reflect the replication status of the virus in cells and the progression of cervical lesions. The purpose of this study is to reveal the prevalence of HPV 39 and the genetic polymorphisms of HPV39 based on E6, E7 and L1 gene in southwest China. METHODS: Cell samples were collected by cervical scraped for HPV detecting and typing, and HPV39 positive samples were selected out. Important E6, E7 and L1 genes of HPV39 were sequenced and analyzed for the study of HPV39 genetic polymorphisms. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by Maximum-likelihood and Kimura 2-parameters methods in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0. The selection pressures of E6, E7 and L1 genes were estimated by Datamonkey web server. The secondary and three-dimensional structure of HPV39 E6, E7 proteins were created by sopma server and SWISS-MODEL software. RESULTS: 344 HPV39 positive samples were selected from 5718 HPV positive cell samples. Among HPV39 E6-E7 sequences, 20 single nucleotide mutations were detected, including 10 non-synonymous and 10 synonymous mutations; 26 single nucleotide mutations were detected in HPV39 L1 sequences, including 7 non-synonymous and 19 synonymous mutations respectively. 11 novel variants of HPV39 E6-E7 (5 in E6 and 6 in E7) and 14 novel variants of HPV39 L1 were identified in this study. A-branch was the most frequent HPV39 lineage in southwest China during our investigation. Selective pressure analysis showed that codon sites 26, 87, 151 in E6 and 75, 180, 222, 272, 284, 346, 356 in L1 were positively selected sites, as well as codon sites 45, 138, 309, 381 were negative selection sites in L1 gene, E7 has neither positive selection sites nor negative selection sites. A certain degree of secondary and three-dimensional structure dislocation was existed due to the non-synonymous mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid substitution affected the secondary and three-dimensional structure of HPV39, and resulting in the differences of carcinogenic potential and biological functions as well as the immune response due to the antigen epitopes difference, the antigen epitopes with stronger adaptability in Southwest will be screened out based on the above research results for the later vaccine development.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with COVID-19-related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity. METHODS: National survey data were obtained from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, an ongoing cross-sectional weekly survey. The sample was provided by Lucid, a web-based market research platform. Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) COVID-19-related concerns, (2) precautionary behaviors, and (3) willingness to return to activity. Key independent variables included age, gender, race or ethnicity, education, household income, political party support, religion, news consumption, number of medication prescriptions, perceived COVID-19 status, and timing of peak COVID-19 infections by state. RESULTS: The data included 125,508 responses from web-based surveys conducted over 20 consecutive weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (comprising approximately 6250 adults per week), between March 19 and August 5, 2020, approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board for analysis. A substantial number of participants were not willing to return to activity even after the restrictions were lifted. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions indicated the following groups had different outcomes (all P<.001): individuals aged &#8805;65 years (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.93-2.18; precautionary behaviors: OR 2.38, 95% CI 2.02-2.80; return to activity: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.37-0.46 vs 18-40 years); men (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.75; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.81; return to activity: OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.88-2.12 vs women); taking &#8805;4 medications (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.54; precautionary behaviors: OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.555; return to activity: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.81 vs <3 medications); Republicans (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.38-0.42; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40-0.50; return to activity: OR 2.22, 95% CI 2.09-2.36 vs Democrats); and adults who reported having COVID-19 (COVID-19-related concerns: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.39; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.81; return to activity: OR 3.99, 95% CI 3.48-4.58 vs those who did not). CONCLUSIONS: Participants' age, party affiliation, and perceived COVID-19 status were strongly associated with their COVID-19-related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity.

While there are no formal guidelines for treating these disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is emerging as a safe and effective treatment. Currently, there is a global shortage of CBT providers, with only a small subset trained in and comfortable with treating patients with FND. We highlight four types of remote CBT delivery to patients with FND to alleviate the access obstacle: workbooks, internet-guided CBT, app-based CBT, and teletherapy. CBT workbooks and teletherapy have been studied in FND, with preliminary studies suggesting efficacy; internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT have not but have been effectively used in patients with psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders. As these disorders are often comorbid and share overlapping neurobiology with FND, internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT represent promising delivery options of CBT for FND. Although remotely-delivered CBT is unlikely to replace in-person CBT and there are technical and logistical challenges to overcome prior to widespread deployment, it holds promise as an adjunct treatment when in-person CBT is inaccessible. We propose a rational approach to future allocation of remote CBT treatment options and highlight important research gaps to bridge beforehand.","output":"Remote delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with functional neurological disorders: Promise and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is seriously endemic in China with 70%~90% of the notified cases worldwide and showing an epidemic tendency of upturn in recent years.

The experimental results manifested that the SETAR and LSTAR approaches presented smaller values among the performance measures in both two forecasting subsamples, when compared with the most extensively used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method, and the former slightly outperformed the latter. Descriptive statistics showed an epidemic tendency of downturn with average annual percent change (AAPC) of ?5.640% in overall HFRS, however, an upward trend with an AAPC = 1.213% was observed since 2016 and according to the forecasts using the SETAR, it would seemingly experience an outbreak of HFRS in China in December 2019. Remarkably, there were dual-peak patterns in HFRS incidence with a strong one occurring in November until January of the following year, additionally, a weak one in May and June annually.

In a search for language that creates comfort with difficult conversations, some specialists favor a biomedical framework, such as central sensitization, which posits abnormal central neuron activity. Without addressing the relative accuracy of mind- or brain-based conceptualizations, we addressed crafted and practiced communication strategies as conversation starters that allow specialists to operate within a biopsychosocial framework without harming the relationship with the patient. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We measured (1) patient resonance with various explanations of the mind-body connection, including examples of both mind- and brain-based communication strategies, and (2) factors associated with resonance and emotional reactions to the explanations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all adult new and returning patients who were literate in English and who attended several musculoskeletal specialty offices were invited to complete questionnaires addressing reactions to one of seven explanations of the mind-body connection assigned using a random number generator. Acknowledging that the relative accuracy of mind-based and nerve- or brain-based strategies are speculative, we developed the following conversation starters: two explanations that were cognitively framed (\\"the mind is a great story teller\\"; one positively framed and one negatively framed), two emotionally framed explanations (\\"stressed or down\\"; one positively framed and one negatively framed), one mentioning thoughts and emotions in more neutral terms (\\"mind and body work together thoughts and emotions affect the way your body experiences pain\\"), and two biomedical neurophysiology-based explanations (\\"nerves get stuck in an over-excited state\\" and \\"overstimulated nerves\\"), all crafted with the assistance of a communication scholar. It was unusual for people to decline (although the exact number of those who did was not tracked) and 304 of 308 patients who started the questionnaires completed them and were analyzed. In this sample, 51% (155 of 304) were men, and the mean  SD age was 49  17 years. Reactions were measured as resonance (a 1 to 5 Likert scale regarding the degree to which the stated concept aligns with their understanding of health and by inference is a comfortable topic of discussion) and self-assessment manikins using circled figurines to measure feelings of happiness (frowning to smiling figures), stimulation/excitement (a relaxed sleepy figure to an energized wide-eyed figure), and security/control (small to large figures). These are commonly used to quantify the appeal and emotive content of a given message. Patients also completed surveys of demographics and mental health. Multilevel multivariable linear regression models were constructed to assess factors associated with resonance, happiness, excitement, and control. RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounding variables such as demographics and mental health measures, a relatively neutral biopsychosocial explanation (\\"mind and body work together\\") had the greatest mean resonance (4.2  0.8 versus 3.8  0.9 for the other explanations; p < 0.01) and the largest regression coefficient for resonance (0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15]). The next-most-resonant explanations were biomedical (\\"excitable nerves\\", \\"over-excited state\\"). Biopsychosocial explanations that mention stress, distress, or cognitive bias (\\"mind is a great storyteller\\") had lower resonance. People with greater unhealthy cognitive bias regarding pain (more catastrophic thinking) were less comfortable with all the explanations (lower resonance, regression coefficient -0.03 [95% CI -0.06 to -0.01]). Emotional reactions were relatively comparable with the exception that people felt less control and security with specific explanations such as \\"excitable nerves\\" and \\"mind is a great storyteller.\\" CONCLUSION: Crafted communication strategies allow musculoskeletal specialists to address health within the biopsychosocial paradigm without harming their relationship with the patient.

Here, we created an intestinal infection model on a chip that allows the recapitulation of human relevant intestinal pathophysiology induced by SARS-CoV-2 at organ level.

The intestinal epithelium showed permissiveness for viral infection and obvious morphological changes with injury of intestinal villi, dispersed distribution of mucus-secreting cells, and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of the intestinal barrier integrity caused by virus. Moreover, the vascular endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology, with disrupted adherent junctions. Transcriptional analysis revealed abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., upregulated cytokine genes), which may contribute to the injury of the intestinal barrier associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This human organ system can partially mirror intestinal barrier injury and the human response to viral infection, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture models.

Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively. Conclusion: The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and its average recovery time in Indian states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Research suggest that albuminuria is not only an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure but may also act as a biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes. To date, no study has synthesized evidence on its role as a prognostic indicator. Thus, the current study aimed to quantitatively assess the prognostic utility of albuminuria as well as dipstick proteinuria in predicting mortality in heart failure patients. Methods: PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to October 10, 2020. All studies reporting multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for albuminuria or dipstick proteinuria for mortality and/or hospitalization in heart failure patients were included. Results: Eleven studies were included. Seven assessed albuminuria and five assessed dipstick proteinuria. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant increased risk of all-cause mortality with microalbuminuria (HR: 1.54; 95% CI, 1.23C1.93; I(2) = 79%; p = 0.0002) and macroalbuminuria (HR: 1.76; 95% CI, 1.21C2.56; I(2) = 88%; p = 0.003) in heart failure patients. The risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization was also significantly increased with macroalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria was associated with significantly increased cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Positive dipstick test for proteinuria was significantly associated with mortality in heart failure (HR: 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28C1.84; I(2) = 67%; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: Both microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria are predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure.

The COVID-19 outbreak brought additional concerns and uncertainties once educational systems implemented distance learning schemes for public health management. Nevertheless, higher educational organizations preferred to implement hybrid approaches for student engagement motivation and high dropout rate avoidance. In Romania, such an educational system has been applied with caution. Since the pandemic needs to be understood as an opportunity for adaptation and education improvements, the purpose of the present paper is to uncover lessons learned and to develop a systematized model based on students' perception regarding face-to-face, online and hybrid systems. For this reason, a grounded theory approach has been preferred. Thus, 149 Romanian students enrolled in the first year in engineering specialities with ages between 18-26 years both male (50.3%) and female (49.7%) have answered the research questions in an online environment due to pandemic restrictions. Based on the online asynchronous student interviews, 220 codes and a further 13 categories have been developed. After a pertinent analysis of the relationships between categories and relevant literature sorting, a theoretical model for the Romanian higher educational current pandemic situation has been proposed. The main face-to-face and online education characteristics are outlined, the hybrid approach becoming a bridge between the two systems.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to neuronal death. Chromosome-wide changes in gene expression have been reported in HD, not only in the brain but also in peripheral blood cells, but whether this translates into nuclear and chromosome architecture alterations has not yet been studied. METHODS We investigate nuclear structure and chromosome organization in HD blood cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization in ultrathin cryosections (cryoFISH), coupled with machine learning image analysis to evaluate size, distribution, and morphology of nuclei and chromosomes. Four chromosomes were analyzed based on up- or downregulation of gene expression in HD. RESULTS We show that blood cells from HD patients display increased nuclear size and filamentary shape, increased size of gene-rich chromosome 19, decreased filamentary shape of gene-rich chromosome 22, and a more radially centralized position for chromosome 19, whereas chromosomes 4 and 5 do not show detectable differences. CONCLUSIONS We identify gross changes in nuclear architecture and chromosome organization associated with HD in blood.

Whilst it has never been more important to accurately assess the mental health risk posed to young people on their arrival in PED, staff undertaking these assessments often have little formal training or oversight. Whilst physical presentations can be quantified by clinical parameters and evidenced investigations, the accurate assessment of mental health cases is inherently subjective, yet just as crucial. Objectives To assess the level of agreement between professionals routinely assessing undifferentiated mental health presentations in PED using video vignettes. Methods We identified mental health-related presentations to a tertiary PED over a one-month period. We selected six cases by random number generation, carefully altered/anonymised the details and engaged actors to re-create the presentations. Using an existing assessment matrix, participating PED and CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health service) staff watched the video vignettes and allocated presentations to 'green', 'amber' or 'red' risk categories. A free marginal multi-rater Kappa was used to assess the level of agreement between responses (0 indicating no agreement and 1 perfect agreement). Staff were asked to rate their confidence in assessing the vignettes on a modified likert scale numbered 1-5 (5 = very confident). This was undertaken as a service evaluation project after discussion with relevant Trust R&D teams. Results The Kappa for all responses was Kfree=0.21 (95%CI 0.04-0.38). Table 1 outlines Kappa values and self-reported confidence within each staff category. Conclusions When assessing the severity of mental health presentations on a simple traffic-light system, the agreement between PED staff was very low. This was lowest amongst nursing staff, who may be less familiar with the assessment matrix. Concordance was high amongst CAMHS staff, admittedly with few participants. This likely reflects their greater exposure and training. Despite the wide variation in responses, each staff group reported their collective confidence in assessing the cases similarly. This may point to a lack of standardised training and staff awareness. In order to best support young people during mental health difficulties, an accurate, objective and standardised assessment is key. This keeps young people safe, informs the level of support/ supervision they require and is crucial to de-escalate crises. This process starts in PED but practice is widely variable in our single-centre study - a level of inconsistency we would not tolerate in the assessment of physical symptoms. We plan to undertake regular multi-disciplinary training led by CAMHS to encourage standardised and robust assessments. We hope to improve the productivity and accuracy of discussions between PED and CAMHS and improve the patient journey for young people. We plan to repeat the vignettes following this intervention.","output":"Assessing mental health presentations to the paediatric emergency Department : An inconsistent process. evaluating staff agreement using video vignettes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for an ethical framework to help us address the local and national challenges that we face as clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, in these severe/critical recovered patients, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II and antigen processing pathways were downregulated in both CD14 monocytes and dendritic cells compared to healthy controls, while the proportion of CD14 monocytes increased. These may lead to the downregulation of T-cell differentiation pathways in memory T cells.

In this study, we developed a multi-scale mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a vaccinated population and used it to predict the role of testing in an outbreak with variants of increased transmissibility. We found that, for low transmissibility variants, testing was most effective when vaccination levels were low to moderate and its impact was diminished when vaccination levels were high.

This emergency situation warrants the taking of extraordinary measures to minimize the negative health impact from an insufficient supply of masks. The decontamination, and reuse of healthcare workers' N95/FFP2 masks is a promising solution which needs to overcome several pitfalls to become a reality. AIM: The overall aim of this article is to provide the reader with a quick overview of the various methods for decontamination and the potential issues to be taken into account when deciding to reuse masks. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide, steam, ozone, ethylene oxide, dry heat and moist heat have all been methods studied in the context of the pandemic. The article first focuses on the logistical implementation of a decontamination system in its entirety, and then aims to summarize and analyze the different available methods for decontamination. METHODS: In order to have a clear understanding of the research that has already been done, we conducted a systematic literature review for the questions: what are the tested methods for decontaminating N95/FFP2 masks, and what impact do those methods have on the microbiological contamination and physical integrity of the masks? We used the results of a systematic review on the methods of microbiological decontamination of masks to make sure we covered all of the recommended methods for mask reuse. To this systematic review we added articles and studies relevant to the subject, but that were outside the limits of the systematic review. These include a number of studies that performed important fit and function tests on the masks but took their microbiological outcomes from the existing literature and were thus excluded from the systematic review, but useful for this paper. We also used additional unpublished studies and internal communication from the University of Geneva Hospitals and partner institutions. RESULTS: This paper analyzes the acceptable methods for respirator decontamination and reuse, and scores them according to a number of variables that we have defined as being crucial (including cost, risk, complexity, time, etc.) to help healthcare facilities decide which method of decontamination is right for them. CONCLUSION: We provide a resource for healthcare institutions looking at making informed decisions about respirator decontamination. This informed decision making will help to improve infection prevention and control measures, and protect healthcare workers during this crucial time. The overall take home message is that institutions should not reuse respirators unless they have to. In the case of an emergency situation, there are some safe ways to decontaminate them.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and N95 masks: reusability and decontamination methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) pup from the southern Adriatic coast of Italy showed cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) and disseminated Toxoplasma gondii co-infection, which probably resulted from CeMV-induced immunosuppression.

Elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 4.85 - 8.60), decreased lymphocyte count (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 3.17 - 5.45), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.55 - 5.20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.46 - 8.02), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.54 - 2.70), hemoptysis (OR, 7.03; 95% CI, 4.57 - 10.81), and male sex (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 - 1.75) were associated with risk of severe COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: Our results highlight factors that could be useful for prognostic model building, help guide patients' selection for randomized clinical trials, as well as provide alternative treatment targets by shedding light to disease pathophysiology.","output":"Risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is little current research comparing stress, burnout, and resilience in pediatric and adult intensive care practitioners. This article analyzes data derived from a 2018 qualitative study of burnout and resilience among ICU providers to explore differences that may exist between the pediatric and adult domains of practice. DESIGN: This study represents a thematic subanalysis of textual data derived from a larger qualitative study of ICU provider burnout and resilience. SETTING: Six international critical care units (Australia, Israel, United States). SUBJECTS: Physicians working at the above sites who had been practicing as intensivists for a minimum period of 4 years. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected using a semistructured interview process, and resulting transcripts were analyzed using postpositivist framework analysis. A secondary analysis was then performed separately on pediatric and adult datasets using the initial coding framework as a template. Three themes related to perceived differences were noted: differences in the patient characteristics within both cohorts, differences in the relationships between staff and family, and personal biases of individual intensivists. Pediatric and adult practitioners differed in their perceptions of the patients perceived responsibility for their illness. Emotional responses to the stressor of child abuse (particularly as they related to clinician-family relationships) also differed. The stress of dealing with family expectations of patient survival even in dire circumstances was unique to the pediatric environment. Both pediatric and adult practitioners commented on the perceived difficulty of assuming the opposite role. Differences in life expectancy and mortality rate were significant factors in this. CONCLUSIONS: Although similar stressors exist within each group, meaningful differences in how these are perceived and personally processed by individual clinicians exist. Better understanding of these differences will assist attempts to enhance the resilience and provide career guidance to aspiring intensive care clinicians.","output":"The Different Challenges in Being an Adult Versus a Pediatric Intensivist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: CKD is a heterogeneous condition with multiple underlying causes, risk factors, and outcomes. Subtyping CKD with multidimensional patient data holds the key to precision medicine. Consensus clustering may reveal CKD subgroups with different risk profiles of adverse outcomes. METHODS: We used unsupervised consensus clustering on 72 baseline characteristics among 2696 participants in the prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study to identify novel CKD subgroups that best represent the data pattern. Calculation of the standardized difference of each parameter used the cutoff of 0.3 to show subgroup features. CKD subgroup associations were examined with the clinical end points of kidney failure, the composite outcome of cardiovascular diseases, and death. RESULTS: The algorithm revealed three unique CKD subgroups that best represented patients' baseline characteristics. Patients with relatively favorable levels of bone density and cardiac and kidney function markers, with lower prevalence of diabetes and obesity, and who used fewer medications formed cluster 1 (n=1203). Patients with higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity and who used more medications formed cluster 2 (n=1098). Patients with less favorable levels of bone mineral density, poor cardiac and kidney function markers, and inflammation delineated cluster 3 (n=395). These three subgroups, when linked with future clinical end points, were associated with different risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and death. Furthermore, patient heterogeneity among predefined subgroups with similar baseline kidney function emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus clustering synthesized the patterns of baseline clinical and laboratory measures and revealed distinct CKD subgroups, which were associated with markedly different risks of important clinical outcomes. Further examination of patient subgroups and associated biomarkers may provide next steps toward precision medicine.","output":"Subtyping CKD Patients by Consensus Clustering: The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease resulting from infection by a novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov2, has rapidly spread since November 2019 leading to a global pandemic SARS-Cov2 has infected over four million people and caused over 290,000 deaths worldwide Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS) Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS, and thus, chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID-19 patients","output":"The case for chronotherapy in COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.

This study employs two models to investigate the factors that contribute to students' involvement in order to improve their learning: constructivism and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Therefore, the objective of this research is to create a model of real use of social media for engagement by conducting an empirical examination into students' adoption of actual use of social media for education. A survey was distributed to 410 university students in order to achieve this goal. A quantitative research approach and partial least squares structural equation modelling were used to acquire the results (PLS-SEM). The outcomes of our empirical examination suggest that determining discriminant validity has become a widely accepted prerequisite for analysing latent factor connections. The studies also demonstrated that using social media to engage students and improve their learning in higher education is extremely beneficial. The findings revealed real use of social media for interaction via interactions variables and TAM model acceptance. Students' pleasure with learning was also favourably associated to their actual usage of social media and involvement, according to the findings. As a conclusion, the result of R-Square's perceived usefulness was 0.611%, students' engagement was 0.561%, actual use of social media was 0.582%, students satisfaction was 0.611%, and students' learning was 0.627%.

Road transport is one of the most important sources of PM in the urban environment, because it directly affects pedestrians. PM measurements were performed in the city of ?ilina, Slovakia, at various road-traffic-related measurement stations over the course of several years. This paper evaluates changes in the concentration of the fine fraction (PM(2.5)), the ultrafine fraction (PM(1)), and the coarse fraction (PM(2.5C10)) over time. PM concentrations were measured by reference gravimetric method. Significant changes in PM concentrations over time due to the diversification of pollution sources and other, secondary factors can be observed from the analysis of the measured data. PM samples were subjected to chemical analysis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the concentrations of elements (Mg, Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ni, and Zn). The seasonal variation of elements was evaluated, and the sources of PM(2.5), PM(1), and PM(2.5C10) were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). PM(2.5) (maximum concentration of 148.95 g/m(3) over 24 h) and PM(1) (maximum concentration of 110.51 g/m(3) over 24 h) showed the highest concentrations during the heating season, together with the elements Cd, Pb, and Zn, which showed a significant presence in these fractions. On the other hand, PM(2.5C10) (maximum concentration of 38.17 g/m(3) over 24 h) was significantly related to the elements Cu, Sb, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, and Al. High correlation coefficients (r  0.8) were found for the elements Mg, Ca, Fe, Al, Cd, Pb, and Zn in the PM(1) fraction, Cd, Pb, and Zn in PM(2.5), and Ba, Sb, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mg, Al, and Ca in PM(2.5C10). Using PMF analysis, three major sources of PM (abrasion from tires and brakes, road dust resuspension/winter salting, and combustion processes) were identified for the PM(2.5) and PM(1) fractions, as well as for the coarse PM(2.5C10) fraction.

This study aimed to examine the reactions of OHS to the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a serious threat to the lives of many, in particular to older adults. As they enter middle age, OHS were observed to have more medical health issues and less positive perceptions of their own aging relative to peers. Less positive subjective aging was associated with more negative psychiatric symptoms in relation to Covid-19-related loneliness, further suggesting that OHS are a group of aging adults with particular vulnerabilities to negative mental health effects of the pandemic and of the social distancing and isolation it imposed.

Like other pro-environmental activities, waste recycling cannot be successfully accomplished by just one or two people, but only by a concerted effort of the community. The collective-action dilemma creates a common underlying difficulty in formulating workable solutions to many environmental problems. With a view to the non-excludability of the outcome, rationality drives people to free-ride efforts of others in waste recycling. To solve this free-rider problem, some scholars suggest the use of economic incentive.

There are three well-established types of PFIC (1C3), caused by mutations in the ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 genes. Biallelic pathogenic variants in the tight junction protein 2 gene (TJP2) were newly reported as a cause for PFIC type 4; however, only a limited number of patients and undisputable variants have been reported for TJP2, and the underlying mechanism for PFIC 4 remains poorly understood. To explore the diagnostic yield of TJP2 analysis in suspected PFIC patients negative for the PFIC1C3 mutation, we designed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing method to analyze TJP2 gene variants in 267 PFIC patients and identified biallelic rare variants in three patients, including three known pathogenic variants and two novel variants in three patients. By using CRISPR-cas9 technology, we demonstrated that TJP2 c.1202A > G was pathogenic at least partially by increasing the expression and nuclear localization of TJP2 protein. With the minigene assay, we showed that TJP2 c.2668-11A > G was a new pathogenic variant by inducing abnormal splicing of TJP2 gene and translation of prematurely truncated TJP2 protein. Furthermore, knockdown of TJP2 protein by siRNA technology led to inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, dispersed F-actin, and disordered microfilaments in LO2 and HepG2celles. Global gene expression profiling of TJP2 knockdown LO2 cells and HepG2 cells identified the dysregulated genes involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Microtubule cytoskeleton genes were significantly downregulated in TJP2 knockdown cells. The results of this study demonstrate that TJP2 c.1202A > G and TJP2 c.2668-11A > G are two novel pathogenic variants and the cytoskeleton-related functions and pathways might be potential molecular pathogenesis for PFIC.","output":"Two Novel Pathogenic Variants of TJP2 Gene and the Underlying Molecular Mechanisms in Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 4 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the most widely discussed topic worldwide in 2020, and at the beginning of the Italian epidemic, scientists tried to understand the virus diffusion and the epidemic curve of positive cases with controversial findings and numbers.

We assessed operative parameters, complications, and clinical outcomes. The complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system. In 148 transplant recipients, 51 underwent BNKT, and 97 KT alone. There was no difference in baseline demographics. BNKT recipients had longer cold ischemia time, required more ICU care, increased blood transfusions and longer hospital stays. The kidney function was similar in the first year in both groups, with no difference in delayed graft function, readmissions or severe grade III and IV complications within 3 months after surgery. Laparoscopic BNKT is safe and feasible at the time of living donor KT. Although higher acuity care is needed with a longer initial hospital stay, there are comparable posttransplant patient and allograft outcomes.","output":"Simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy with kidney transplantation in patients with ESRD due to ADPKD: A single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management of the oral and maxillofacial surgical patient during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is quite challenging This paper assesses the impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on oral and maxillofacial surgical practice and lays down various guidelines employed to counter the pandemic Separate protocol and guidelines are formulated for examining the patients in the Outpatient Department (OPD), minor surgical procedures in the clinics, and for managing patients in the triage and operation theatres Particular emphasis should be given to disinfection and infection control measures to minimize the risk of COVID-19 Infection control in the clinical, hospital, and operation theatre setup is the most essential factor in the prevention of spread of COVID-19 disease in the workplace The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), barrier techniques, proper hand wash practices, surface disinfection, and proper sterilization of instruments help in infection control Providing effective treatment to patients with conditions that cannot be deferred or controlled by pharmacological management and taking care to minimize the risk of COVID-19 to the hospital personnel is the primary concern in the present scenario ? 2020 Journal of International Oral Health Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow","output":"Managing the oral and maxillofacial surgical patient during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A review of guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify the training transitions and dietary habits of volleyball athletes' before and during Ramadan in the COVID-19 pandemic.

He was admitted 1 month after HSCT for failure to thrive and initiated on parenteral nutrition due to worsening diarrhea and suspected gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD). During admission, the patient was continued on daily oral posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and was found to have subtherapeutic posaconazole and deficient vitamin levels, likely secondary to his gastrojejunostomy and increased gastric transit time. The oral posaconazole was altered to twice-daily dosing in an effort to increase serum drug levels and prevent IFIs.

We aimed to compare the CFR and its predictors of COVID-19 and SARS patients using a territory-wide cohort in Hong Kong. METHODS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study using data captured from all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and SARS patients were identified. The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1013 COVID-19 patients (mean age, 38.4 years; 53.9% male) diagnosed from 23 January to 14 April 2020 and 1670 SARS patients (mean age, 44.4 years; 44.0% male) from March to June 2003. Fifty-five (5.4%) COVID-19 patients and 432 (25.9%) SARS patients had reached the primary endpoint in 30 days. By 30 June 2003, 286 SARS patients had died (CFR, 17.1%). By 7 June 2020, 4 COVID-19 patients had died (CFR, 0.4%). After adjusting for demographic and clinical parameters, COVID-19 was associated with a 71% lower risk of primary endpoint compared with SARS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, .21C.40; P < .0001). Age, diabetes mellitus, and laboratory parameters (high lactate dehydrogenase, high C-reactive protein, and low platelet count) were independent predictors of the primary endpoint in COVID-19 patients, whereas use of antiviral treatments was not associated with primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: The CFR of COVID-19 was 0.4%.

The 50% of rats receiving BMSCs intravenously (s-rBMSCs) died after treatment. A higher cytokine trend was measured in BMSCs locally injected rats (l-rBMSCs) at day 3 and in vancomycin systemically injected rats (l-VANC) at day 7 compared to the other groups. At day 14, the highest cytokine values were measured in l-VANC and in l-rBMSCs for IL-10. CT showed a good bony bridging in s-VANC and excellent both in l-VANC and in l-rBMSCs. The bacterial growth was lower in s-VANC and l-VANC than in l-rBMSCs. Histology demonstrated the presence of new woven bone in s-VANC and a more mature bony bridging was found in l-VANC. The l-rBMSCs showed a poor bony bridging of fibrovascular tissue. Our results could suggest the synergic use of systemic and local injection of vancomycin as an effective treatment to prevent septic nonunions.

Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Adults admitted to ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for >24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score (MMS) to identify the time taken to first mobilise (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge. RESULTS: A total of n=177 patients were identified, of whom n=110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. Whilst on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19  10 days), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The mean  SD time to first mobilise was 14  7 days, with a median MMS at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4-6), which represents participants able to stand and step round to a chair with or without assistance. Time to mobilise was significantly longer in those with higher BMI (p<0.001), whilst older patients (p=0.012) and those with more comorbidities (p=0.017) were more likely to require further rehabilitation post-discharge. CONCLUSION: The early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK resembles the experience in other countries, with high acuity of illness and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation required for those patients admitted to ICU. Whilst the time to commence rehabilitation was delayed due to this severity of illness, rehabilitation was possible within the ICU, and led to increased levels of mobility from waking prior to ICU discharge.

The Kaiser Permanente Sepsis Risk Calculator (KP-SRC) uses the population's background incidence of EOS, objective information at birth and the infant's clinical presentation to evaluate risk of neonatal EOS in infants >34 weeks gestation. This has safely shown to reduce the use of antibiotics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the local Operational Delivery Network endorsed the use of the KP-SRC. Objectives To show implementation of KP-SRC can safely and effectively reduce the incidence of antibiotic use in well babies over 34 weeks gestation without an increase in missed cases of sepsis. Methods KP-SRC was implemented in 4 neonatal units. KPSRC is used on all babies with risk factors for infection in accordance with the NICE EOS guideline [CG149] and antibiotics are started according to the recommended outcome. There was slight variation in the parameters used by the units in the calculation of KP-SRC (i.e. Infection incidence rate of 0.8/1000 in 2 units and 0.6/1000 in the other 2 units). Blood culture data during the first seven days of life was provided on a monthly basis by the laboratories. Babies < 34 weeks gestation were excluded and clinical details of the remaining babies were reviewed, particularly with respect to positive blood cultures and readmissions following discharge home. Data was reviewed over a consecutive 5 month period prior to implementation of the KP-SRC (1 Sept 2019 - 31 Jan 2020), and post implementation (1 Sept 2020 - 31 Jan 2021). Results There was a percentage reduction in blood cultures taken in the post KP-SRC implementation period between the 4 units of 52 to 85% (mean 60%). There were 5 positive blood cultures, all babies were commenced on antibiotics at birth in accordance with the KP-SRC recommendation. Twenty babies were started on antibiotics after 24 hours of age and received 5 days of antibiotics. Twelve had no risk factors for infection and would not have been picked up by NICE. Of the eight assessed by KP-SRC, two were admitted to the neonatal unit on day 2 with tachypnea but did not require respiratory support. Only one baby was readmitted following discharge and received 5 days of antibiotics. This baby was readmitted on day 7 with apnoea requiring ventilation. There was a history of maternal prolonged rupture of membranes and mild maternal pyrexia but the baby was well in the immediate postnatal period. Blood cultures were negative with normal CRP's. Conclusions The KP-SRC can lead to a safe and consistent reduction in the number of well babies receiving antibiotics post-delivery. All babies with positive blood cultures were on antibiotics as guided by the KP-SRC and there were no missed cases of sepsis.","output":"The safe implementation of the kaiser permanente sepsis risk calculator in 4 neonatal units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters are experienced by, and responded to, differently based on the gender of those experiencing these The responsibilities of women, particularly mothers, are amplified during times of pressure This study investigated the experiences of teaching-mothers in Pakistan during the Covid-19 pandemic to understand the challenges they faced as professionals and as mothers The data were collected through in-depth interviews of 24 teaching-mothers The study participants were identified through the snowball sampling technique The data were collected until the point of data saturation and analysed through The analysis indicates that teaching-mothers in Pakistan faced issues in terms of maintaining their work-life balance, managing space and resources for online teaching, and learning a new set of skills in order to teach online These multiple challenges affected their mental health The findings indicate a sharp division of gendered roles in Pakistan and their negative impact on the mental health of women during Covid-19 The study suggests devising organizational policies to support teaching-mothers generally and especially during crises [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Gender Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Covid-19: experiences of teaching-mothers in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bob Jessop is a living classic in the field of critical governance studies.

This first-ever study investigates SARS COVID-2 aerosol transport in age-specific airway systems. A highly asymmetric age-specific airway model and fluent solver (ANSYS 19.2) are used for the investigation. The computational fluid dynamics measurement predicts higher SARS COVID-2 aerosol concentration in the airway wall for older adults than for younger people. The numerical study reports that the smaller SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol deposition rate in the right lung is higher than that in the left lung, and the opposite scenario occurs for the larger SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol rate. The numerical results show a fluctuating trend of pressure at different generations of the age-specific model. The findings of this study would improve the knowledge of SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol transportation to the upper airways which would thus ameliorate the targeted aerosol drug delivery system.","output":"How severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 aerosol propagates through the age-specific upper airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and morphological features of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis, by determining the presence of viral RNA and proteins in myocardial tissue.

Also, SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells occur in unexposed healthy individuals from endemic coronaviruses that cause the common cold. The finding of the expression of adaptive SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells in unexposed healthy individuals may be due to multiple cross-reactive viral protein targets following previous exposure to endemic human coronavirus infections. The opinion of the authors is that determination of protein sequence homologies across seemingly disparate viral protein libraries may provide epitope-matching data that link SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cell signatures to prior administration of cross-reacting vaccines to common viral pathogens. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 initiates diverse cellular immune responses, including the associated cytokine storm. Therefore, it is possible that the intact virus possesses a required degree of conformational matching, or stereoselectivity, to effectively target its receptor on multiple cell types. Therefore, conformational matching may be viewed as an evolving mechanism of viral infection and viral replication by an evolutionary modification of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and host cell entry. The authors propose that convalescent memory T cell immunity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may result from an evolutionarily adapted immune response to coronavirus and the common cold.","output":"Convalescent Memory T Cell Immunity in Individuals with Mild or Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection May Result from an Evolutionarily Adapted Immune Response to Coronavirus and the Common Cold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Manual compounding of expensive cytotoxic drugs often leads to drug wastage, due to residual product in vials not being used. Aim To determine the cost savings that can be achieved by implementing an automated compounding process with a vial sharing strategy, instead of manually compounding drugs. Method The drug wastage during automated compounding was compared with that of three simulation scenarios using manual compounding, in a general teaching hospital. All automatically compounded preparations of rituximab, pemetrexed, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab from September 2019 and up until February 2020 were included. A vial sharing strategy was implemented during the automated compounding process (scenario 1). In this scenario, all residual drugs could be reused for up to seven days. Two of the simulation scenarios for manual compounding were executed using a batch compounding strategy, for an entire working day (scenario 2), and twice a day (scenario 3). The third manual compounding simulation was executed without making use of a batch compounding strategy (scenario 4). Results There was no drug wastage during automated compounding with vial sharing (scenario 1). The cost of drug wastage for 1001 preparations, over a period of six months for rituximab, pemetrexed, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab combined, were  34,133 for scenario 2,  46,688 for scenario 3, and  88,255 for scenario 4. The estimated total cost savings between 2017, when the compounding robot was commissioned, and 2021, was more than  280,000.

This virus affects mainly the respiratory system, but the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also a target, meanwhile SARS-CoV-2 was already detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum, and in fecal samples from COVID-19 patients. Prolonged GIT manifestations in COVID-19, mainly the diarrhea, were correlated with decreased richness and diversity of the gut microbiota, immune deregulation and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. So, the bidirectional interactions between the respiratory mucosa and the gut microbiota, known as gut-lung axis, are supposed to be involved in the healthy or pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In accordance, the intestinal dysbiosis is associated with increased mortality in other respiratory infections, due to an exacerbated inflammation and decreased regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the lungs and in the gut, pointing to this important relationship between both mucosal compartments. Therefore, since the mucous membranes from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are affected, in addition to dysbiosis and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that adjunctive therapies based on the modulation of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of eubiosis conditions could be an important therapeutic approach for constraining the harmful consequences of COVID-19. Then, in this review, we summarized studies showing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal system and the related digestive COVID-19 manifestations, in addition to the literature demonstrating nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and intestinal dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients.

The force data (push and pull) will be sent directly to the database server cloud with a recording frequency of every second. Three types of fluid treatment levels are used i.e. water, liquid soap, and hand sanitizer gel. Three types of fluid volume treatment levels used were 50 ml, 150 ml, and 250 ml.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study with non-probabilistic snowball sampling of health professionals (medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, auxiliary care) of different levels of care (primary care, hospital, nursing homes, etc.), who were in contact or not with patients with COVID-19, in June 2020 in Spain. We prepared an electronic survey of 81 questions structured in four blocks: sociodemographic variables, knowledge about COVID-19, availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmental protection measures and training received. RESULTS: 855 health workers responded, 81.5% women and the mean age was 44 years (28-68). 93.4% knew the main symptoms but 40.4% did not identify the route of transmission via droplets and contact. 67.5% of them cared for COVID-19 patients without adequate PPE and 29.1% wore the same PPE continuously for more than 4 hours. 25.6% of workers had not received any type of training in donning and removing the PPE and 61.2% of them were unable to previously practice the process. The frequency of coronavirus infection among health professionals was 19.4%, which is higher in those professionals who had not received specific training (25.8 vs 17.2%, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Training, drafting protocols and screening programs, supervising the situations of greatest risk, ensuring the availability of material and increasing the commitment of health institutions to support health personnel should be im-plemented as contagion prevention strategies.","output":"[Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among health professionals in Spain]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the current study, we evaluated factors that increase the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient death rate by analyzing the data from two cohort hospitals. In addition, we studied whether underlying neurological diseases are risk factors for death. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 103 adult inpatients (aged &#8805; 18 years). We evaluated differences in demographic data between surviving and non-surviving COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: In a multivariate logistic analysis, age and the presence of chronic lung disease and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) were the only significant parameters for predicting COVID-19 non-survival (p < 0.05). However, hypertension, coronary vascular disease, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and history of taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were not significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients. The optimal cutoff value obtained from the maximum Youden index was 70 (sensitivity, 80.77%; specificity, 61.04%), and the odds ratio of non-survival increased 1.055 fold for every year of age.

We use international comparisons as a starting point. METHODS: New York City, consisting of some 175 zip codes, is an ideal arena to pursue the above study given the large variation in case incidence rates across zip codes. We conducted systematic regression studies employing data with zip code granularity. Our model specifications are based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0. RESULTS: Average household size emerges as the single most important driver behind the large variation in COVID-19 incidence rates. It independently explains 62% of the variation. The percentage of the population above the age of 65 and the percentage below the poverty line are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates. As to ethnic/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics and Asians within the population are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) Contrary to common belief, population density, by itself, does not have a significantly positive impact (other than when a high population is driven by large household sizes).

We developed statistical regression models that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people from the viral load detected in the wastewater with a reliability close to 90%. This is the first wastewater-based epidemiological model that could potentially be adapted to track the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic anywhere in the world, monitoring both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. It can help to understand with a high degree of reliability the true magnitude of the epidemic in a place at any given time and can be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks.","output":"Highly predictive regression model of active cases of COVID-19 in a population by screening wastewater viral load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have designed and synthesized two unprecedented microporous three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks, {[Cd6(TPOM)3(L)6]12DMF3H2O}n (1) and {[Zn2(TPOM)(L)2]2DMFH2O}n (2), based on a flexible quadritopic ligand, tetrakis(4-pyridyloxymethylene)methane (TPOM), and a bent dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-(dimethylsilanediyl)bis-benzoic acid (H2L). The networks of 1 and 2 share a 4-c uninodal net NbO topology but exhibit different metal environments due to coordination preferences of Cd(II) and Zn(II). The Cd(II) center in 1 is six-coordinated, whereas the Zn(II) center in 2 is only four-coordinated, making the latter an unsaturated metal center. Such modulation of coordination atmosphere of metal centers in MOFs with the same topology is possible due to diverse binding of the carboxylate groups of L2-. Both 1 and 2 have relatively high thermal stability and exhibit permanent porosity after the removal of guest solvent molecules based on variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption analysis. These materials exhibit similar gas adsorption properties, especially highly selective CO2 uptake/capture over other gases (N2 and CH4). However, because of the presence of an unsaturated Lewis acidic metal site, 2 acts as a very efficient heterogeneous catalyst toward the chemical conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates under mild conditions, whereas 1 shows very less activity. This work provides experimental evidence for the postulate that an unsaturated metal site in MOFs enhances adsoprtion of CO2 and promotes its conversion via the Lewis-acid catalysis.","output":"Effect of Unsaturated Metal Site Modulation in Highly Stable Microporous Materials on CO2 Capture and Fixation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing demand for online education platforms. However, it is challenging to correctly choose course content from among many online education resources due to the differences in users knowledge structures. Therefore, a course recommender system has the essential role of improving the learning efficiency of users. At present, many online education platforms have built diverse recommender systems that utilize traditional data mining methods, such as Collaborative Filtering (CF). Despite the development and contributions of many recommender systems based on CF, diverse deep learning models for personalized recommendation are being studied because of problems such as sparsity and scalability. Therefore, to solve traditional recommendation problems, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based course recommender system (DECOR), which elaborately captures high-level user behaviors and course attribute features. The DECOR model can reduce information overload, solve high-dimensional data sparsity problems, and achieve high feature information extraction performance. We perform several experiments utilizing real-world datasets to evaluate the DECOR models performance compared with that of traditional recommendation approaches. The experimental results indicate that the DECOR model offers better and more robust recommendation performance than the traditional methods.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Course Recommender System for Sustainable Development in Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of technology and importance of access to high-speed broadband has become glaringly obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance. In this review, we summarise recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of faecalCoral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19 and the diagnosis, management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during GI endoscopy procedures.","output":"Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: manifestations, pathology, management and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Current hemodialysis (HD) treatments have limited ability to clear larger-molecular-weight uremic toxins. Retention is associated with increased symptom burden, low health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and high mortality. Improved clearance, using novel medium cut-off dialyzers, termed expanded HD (HDx), may be associated with improved subjective experience. We have previously developed a dynamic patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) instrument to allow iterative recording to better appreciate the overall burden of disease and assess the impact of therapy changes. STUDY DESIGN: Single-center interventional pilot study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 28 patients established on maintenance HD, London, Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION: Initial study consisting of 2-week observation (baseline-conventional high-flux HD) followed by 12 weeks of HDx. HRQoL was assessed using the dynamic PROM instrument thrice weekly (enabled in a dedicated app as the London Evaluation of Illness [LEVIL]). Extension phase; 2-week baseline with 24 weeks of HDx and 8-week washout. OUTCOMES: Principal aim was to establish whether HDx therapy was associated with improved HRQoL, evidence of dose-dependant response, and whether effects were durable over time, using LEVIL. RESULTS: Patients with lower LEVIL scores (<70/100) at baseline showed improvement in overall HRQoL after 8 weeks of therapy with similar carryover effect. General well-being, energy, and sleep quality were improved significantly as a consequence of HDx therapy. There were no detrimental effects of HDx detected in patients with higher baseline HRQoL. LIMITATIONS: Small nonrandomized sample size. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic interfered with the extension phase. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic PROM assessment effectively identified patients with lower HRQoL and higher symptom burden, demonstrating durable time/dose-dependent improvements across a range of symptom domains. The use of this instrument may allow targeted selection of patients most likely to benefit from HDx therapy and assist in monitoring response and defining effect size and treatment duration to allow optimal design of further definitive randomized controlled trials of this newly introduced technology.

In 2002 and following years, the scenario changed dramatically with the advent of the new more pathogenic CoVs, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the new zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, likely originated from bat species and responsible for the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which to date has caused 15,581,007 confirmed cases and 635,173 deaths in 208 countries, including Italy. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne via droplets generated by symptomatic patients, and possibly asymptomatic individuals during incubation of the disease, although for the latter, there are no certain data yet. However, research on asymptomatic viral infection is currently ongoing worldwide to elucidate the real prevalence and mortality of the disease. From a clinical point of view, COVID-19 would be defined as COVID Planet  because it presents as a multifaceted disease, due to the large number of organs and tissues infected by the virus. Overall, based on the available published data, 80.9% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild disease/infection, 13.8% severe pneumonia, 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure, and 3% of these cases are fatal, but mortality parameter is highly variable in different countries. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia and a cytokine storm syndrome, characterized by a severe and fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) with development of endothelitis and generalized thrombosis that can lead to organ failure and death. Risk factors include advanced age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Virus entry occurs via binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present in almost all tissues and organs through the Spike (S) protein.

Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclearin particular, what works best for whom and when. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two smartphoneCdelivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater benefits on pain outcomes and depressive symptoms at 6 months and a greater reduction in health care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 months. METHODS: The CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) study is a multisite comparative effectiveness trial funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. CaRISMA is conducted at six clinical academic sites, in partnership with four community-based organizations. CaRISMA will evaluate the effectiveness of two 12-week health coachCsupported digital health programs with a total of 350 participants in two groups: CBT (n=175) and Education (n=175). Participants will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be the change in pain interference between the study arms. We will also evaluate changes in pain intensity, depressive symptoms, other patient-reported outcomes, and health care use as secondary outcomes. We have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.37 SDs between study arms on 6-month changes in the outcomes with 15% expected attrition at 6 months.

We investigated how health care systems should communicate with patients about possible exposures to blood-borne pathogens that may have occurred during their care. Our goal was to determine how best to communicate uncertain risk information in a way that would minimize harm to patients, maintain their trust, and encourage patients to seek follow-up treatment. Methods. Participants (N = 1103) were randomized to receive one of six vignette surveys; 997 (98.4%) responded. All vignettes described the same event, but differed by risk level and recommendations (lower risk v. higher risk) and by communication mode (telephone, letter, social media). We measured participants perceived risk of blood-borne infection, trust in the health care system, and shared decision making about next clinical steps. Open-ended questions were analyzed using grounded thematic analysis. Results. When the vignette requested patients to undergo testing and practice certain health behaviors (higher risk), participants likelihood of seeking follow-up testing for blood-borne pathogens and their understanding of health issues increased. Perceived trust was unaffected by risk level or communication processes. Qualitative data indicated a desire for telephone communication from providers known to the patient. Limitations. It is not clear whether higher risk language or objective risk levels in vignettes motivated patients behavioral intentions. Conclusion. Using higher risk language when disclosing large-scale adverse events increased participants willingness to seek follow-up care. Implications. Health care organizations disclosures should focus on the next steps to take after health care exposures. This communication should involve helping patients to understand their personal health issues better, make them feel that they know which steps to take following the receipt of this information, and encouraging them to seek follow-up infectious disease testing in order to better take care of themselves.","output":"Risk Communication After Health Care Exposures: An Experimental Vignette Survey With Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, software engineers' daily life was disrupted and they were abruptly forced into working remotely from home.

A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serological testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this sensitive test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual's immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test make it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.IMPORTANCE Serological surveillance has become an important public health tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of protective antibodies and seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination can help guide patient care plans and public health policies. Serology tests can detect antibodies against past infections; consequently, they can help overcome the shortcomings of molecular tests, which can detect only active infections. This is important, especially when considering that many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. In this study, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based qualitative and quantitative serology test developed to measure IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The test can be deployed using commonly available laboratory reagents and equipment and displays high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IgG titers in patient samples can be estimated from a single measurement, enabling the assay's use in high-throughput clinical environments.","output":"Single-Dilution COVID-19 Antibody Test with Qualitative and Quantitative Readouts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anurans (frogs and toads) are among the most globally threatened taxonomic groups. Successful conservation of anurans will rely on improved data on the status and changes in local populations, particularly for rare and threatened species. Automated sensors, such as acoustic recorders, have the potential to provide such data by massively increasing the spatial and temporal scale of population sampling efforts. Analyzing such data sets will require robust and efficient tools that can automatically identify the presence of a species in audio recordings. Like bats and birds, many anuran species produce distinct vocalizations that can be captured by autonomous acoustic recorders and represent excellent candidates for automated recognition. However, in contrast to birds and bats, effective automated acoustic recognition tools for anurans are not yet widely available. An effective automated call recognition method for anurans must be robust to the challenges of real-world field data and should not require extensive labeled data sets. Here, we present the repeat interval-based bioacoustic identification tool (RIBBIT), which classifies anuran vocalizations in audio recordings based on their periodic structure. We apply this tool to field recordings to study two species, the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) of temperate North American grasslands and the critically endangered variable harlequin frog (Atelopus varius) of tropical Central American rainforests. We show that RIBBIT can accurately identify boreal chorus frogs, even when they vocalize in heavily overlapping choruses, and can identify variable harlequin frog vocalizations at a field site where it has been very rarely encountered in visual surveys. Using relatively few simple parameters, RIBBIT can detect any vocalization with a periodic structure, including those of many anurans, insects, birds, and mammals. We provide open-source implementations of RIBBIT in Python and R to support its use for other taxa and communities.

Spike Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD)-specific circulating antibodies and plasma neutralizing activity generally decreased over time, whereas RBD-specific memory B cells persisted. Additionally, using antibody depletion techniques, we showed that the neutralizing activity of plasma specifically resides in the anti-RBD antibodies. More vigorous antibody and B cell responses to vaccination were observed in previously infected subjects relative to uninfected comparators, presumably due to immune priming by infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased numbers of double negative B memory cells, which are described as a dysfunctional B cell subset.

The illegal trafficking in drugs, which is often concealed in other commercial activity, will be affected by these disruptions. This is particularly true for precursor chemicals, controlled substances of synthetic origin, and new psychoactive substances coming from Asia. China hosts large and under-regulated pharmaceutical and chemical sectors that provide many of the active ingredients used both in legitimate medicines and illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine. Unregulated producers and vendors in China have been supplying drug trafficking organizations in Mexico or using the internet and postal service to directly sell fentanyl to buyers in North America. The magnitude of supply shortages and interrupted trade of chemicals and synthetic drugs coming from China will depend on the breadth and depth of COVID-19's disruptions. In turn, this could impact vulnerable drug-using populations. Drawing on historical accounts of prior supply disruptions, this commentary offers some initial speculation as to the possible effects of COVID-19 on the supply of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and precursor chemicals supplied to North America from China, which may have important lessons for other parts of the globe. Prior supply disruptions coincided with elevated prices and reduced purities of street drugs as well as increases in the number of users entering treatment. However, it is challenging to predict how developments will unfold given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic. A short-term breakdown in supply chains, interrupted trade, or social distancing mandates may not have much of an effect on the availability of synthetic drugs. Yet, disruptions in trade for months or years could shape how drugs are supplied or used. Drug policy will need to evaluate market indicators as soon as they are available but responding now with expanded medication therapies, like methadone, may help save lives.

The proportion of diabetic patients who develop DKD and progress to end-stage renal disease has remained nearly the same. This unmet need for DKD treatment is caused by the complex pathophysiology of DKD, and the difficulty of translating treatment from bench to bed, which further adds to the growing argument that DKD is not a homogeneous disease. To better capture the full spectrum of DKD in our design of treatment regimens, we need improved diagnostic tools that can better distinguish the subgroups within the condition. For instance, DKD is typically placed in the broad category of a non-inflammatory kidney disease. However, genome-wide transcriptome analysis studies consistently indicate the inflammatory signaling pathway activation in DKD.

However, pathways underlying the association between deprivation and physical activity remain overlooked. Here, we examined whether the association between several indicators of deprivation (administrative area deprivation and self-reported individual material and social deprivation) and physical activity was mediated by body mass index (BMI). In addition, consistent with an intersectional perspective, we tested whether this mediating pathway was moderated by participants' gender and we hypothesized that the mediating effect of BMI would be stronger among women, relative to men. We used two independent large-scale studies to test the proposed pathways cross-sectionally and prospectively. In a first sample composed of 5,723 British adults (Study 1), BMI partly mediated the cross-sectional association between administrative area deprivation and self-reported physical activity. Moreover, relative to men, the detrimental effect of deprivation on BMI was exacerbated among women, with BMI mediating 3.1% of the association between deprivation and physical activity among women (vs 1.5% among men). In a second sample composed of 8,358 European older adults (Study 2), our results confirmed the findings observed in Study 1: BMI partly mediated the prospective association between perceived material and social deprivation and self-reported physical activity. Moreover, compared to men, the effect of deprivation on BMI was more pronounced among women, with BMI respectively mediating 8.1% and 3.4% of the association between material and social deprivation and physical activity among women (vs 1.3% and 1.2% among men).

Here, we describe a novel aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis - TFEB - is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased siRNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. In particular, viral infection triggers marked PAK2 activation, which in turn, phosphorylates and primes TFEB for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Deletion of either DCAF7 or PAK2 blocks viral-mediated TFEB degradation and protects against viral-induced cytopathic effects. We further derive a series of small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit viral-triggered TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad anti-viral activities including attenuating in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, these results delineate a viral-triggered pathway that disables the endogenous cellular system that maintains lysosomal function and suggest that small molecule inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF7 represent a novel class of endo-lysosomal, host-directed, anti-viral therapies.","output":"Modulation of lysosomal function as a therapeutic approach for coronaviral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trust between governors and the governed is seen as essential to facilitating good governance This claim has become a prominent contention during the coronavirus pandemic The crisis also presents a unique test of key hypotheses in the trust literature Moreover, understanding the dynamics of trust, how it facilitates and hinders policy responses, and also the likely effects of these responses on trust are going to be fundamental questions in policy and trust research in the future In this article, we review the early literature on the coronavirus pandemic and political and social trust, summarise their findings and highlight key challenges for future research We show how the studies shed light on trust?s association with implementation of government measures, public compliance with them, mortality rates and the effect of government action on levels of trust We also urge caution given the varying ways of measuring trust and operationalising the impact of the pandemic, the existence of common issues with quantitative studies and the relatively limited geographical scope of studies to date We argue that it is going to be important to have a holistic understanding of these dynamics, using mixed-methods research as well as the quantitative studies we review here","output":"Trust and the Coronavirus Pandemic: What are the Consequences of and for Trust?

METHODS Forty-two children were assigned to one of seven groups of six patients each according to propofol target Ce. After fentanyl administration propofol TCI was started with an assigned Ce target. A successful response was defined as loss of eyelash reflex and bispectral index < 50, 45 s after reaching the assigned Ce. Logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate propofol Ce50 and Ce95. RESULTS Twenty-eight children had a successful response with the assigned propofol Ce. In these patients, a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (79-59, P < 0.0001) and in heart rate (95-83, P < 0.0001) was observed.

Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5-7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades.

METHODS: A dynamic simulation SIRD model was designed to assess the effectiveness of policy measures on four next-wave scenarios, each preceded by two different lockdowns. The four scenarios were (1) no-measures, (2) uniform measures, (3) differential measures based on isolating > 60 years of age group, and (4) differential measures with additional contact reduction measures for the 20C60 years of age group. The dynamic simulation model was prepared for two prototype European countries, Northwestern (NW) and Southern (S) country. Both prototype countries were characterized based on age composition and contact matrix. RESULTS: The results show that the outcomes of the next-wave scenarios depend on number of infections of previous lockdowns. All scenarios reduce the incremental deaths compared with a no-measures scenario. Differential measures show lower number of deaths despite an increase of infections. Additionally, prototype S shows overall more deaths compared with prototype NW due to a higher share of older citizens. CONCLUSION: This study shows that differential measures are a worthwhile option for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. This may also be the case in situations where relevant parts of the population have taken up vaccination. Additionally, the effectiveness of interventions strongly depends on the number of previously infected individuals. The results of this study may be useful when planning and forecasting the impact of non-pharmacological interventions and vaccination campaigns.","output":"Reconstructing the Effectiveness of Policy Measures to Avoid Next-Wave COVID-19 Infections and Deaths Using a Dynamic Simulation Model: Implications for Health Technology Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Few and small studies have described the management of immunomodulant/immunosuppressive therapies or phototherapy in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A national registry, named DA-COVID-19 and involving 35 Italian dermatology units, was established in order to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of adult AD patients treated with systemic immunomodulant/immunosuppressive medications or phototherapy. Demographic and clinical data were obtained at different timepoints by teledermatology during COVID-19 pandemic, when regular visits were not allowed due to sanitary restrictions. Disease severity was assessed by both physician- and patient-reported assessment scores evaluating itch intensity, sleep disturbances, and AD severity. Results: A total of 1831 patients were included, with 1580/1831 (86.3%) continuing therapy during pandemic. Most patients were treated with dupilumab (86.1%, 1576/1831) that was interrupted in only 9.9% (156/1576) of cases, while systemic immunosuppressive compounds were more frequently withdrawn. Treatment interruption was due to decision of the patient, general practitioner or dermatologist in 39.9% (114/286), 5.6% (16/286), and 30.1% (86/286) of cases, respectively. Fear of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (24.8%, 71/286) was one of the main causes of interruption. Sixteen patients (0.9%) resulted positive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3 of them (0.2%) were hospitalized but no cases of COVID-related death occurred.

To improve awareness of HCV status, strategies are needed to ensure easy access to HCV testing by as-yet unreached populations. HCV-self-testing, an innovative strategy, could further increase HCV testing uptake. This assessment explores perceptions around HCV self-testing among members of the public and healthcare workers in Rwanda. METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken in Masaka District Hospital, comprising individual interviews, group interviews and participatory action research (PAR) activities. Purposive and snowball sampling methods guided the selection of informants. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the findings. RESULTS: The participants comprised 36 members of the public and 36 healthcare workers. Informants appreciated HCV self-testing as an innovative means of increasing access to HCV testing, as well as an opportunity to test privately and subsequently autonomously decide whether to seek further HCV care. Informants further highlighted the need to make HCV self-testing services free of charge at the nearest health facility. Disadvantages identified included the lack of pre/post-test counselling, as well as the potential psychosocial harm which may result from the use of HCV self-testing. CONCLUSION: HCV self-testing is perceived to be an acceptable method to increase HCV testing in Rwanda.

Problems of Human-Vehicles-Interaction (HVI) in context awareness are analyzed. Historical traffic flow in three different situations, including novice user situation, mid user situation, and expert user situation, are taken as the data sources. The HVI data are preprocessed afterward. Next, Dilated Convolution (DC) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) are integrated (DC-LSTM) to build an HVI model based on situation adaptive. The proposed model is simulated to analyze its performance. Simulation experiments suggest that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the proposed model are 4.64%, 5.34%, and 7.82%, respectively. Although these three metrics increase under the mid user and expert user situations, the proposed model can still provide a higher accuracy than LTSM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Network (SRN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Besides, the prediction velocity can maintain about 60 Frame-Per-Second (FPS) under all three user situations. Regarding the path guidance performance, the proposed model can suppress the traffic congestion and dredge the congested sections effectively.

The principle concerns about emergence of antiviral resistance in infl uenza viruses are loss of drug effi cacy, transmission of resistant variants, and possible increased virulence or transmissibility of resistant variants (1). Because seasonal infl uenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have modest effects on clinical recovery, except perhaps in immunocompromised or immunologically na?ve hosts, such as young infants or during the appearance of a novel strain. In contrast to the limited impact of resistance emergence in the treated immunocompetent individual, the epidemiologic impact of resistance emergence and transmission could be considerable, including loss of both prophylactic and therapeutic activity for a particular drug, at the household, community, or perhaps global level. Infl uenza epidemiology in temperate climates is expected to provide some protection against widespread circulation of resistant variants, as viruses do not persist between epidemics but rather are re-introduced each season and new variants appear often (2, 3).","output":"Antiviral Resistance in Influenza Viruses: Clinical and Epidemiological Aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has affected every aspect of daily life since December 2019 and caused massive damage to the world.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-B signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-B-inhibitor  and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-B pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3 UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-B-signaling pathway.

METHODS: Clinical and microbiological cure rates, 28-day survival rates, and safety evaluation findings were compared between patients treated with CAZ-AVI-based regimen and those treated with TGC-based regimen in this retrospective study. Conventional multivariate logistic regression analysis and regression adjustment analysis with propensity score (PS) were performed to control for confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 105 cases of critically ill ICU patients with CRKP-induced HAP or VAP were included in the present study from July 2019 to September 2020; 62 patients (59%) received TGC-based regimen and 43 patients (41%) received CAZ-AVI-based regimen. The most common concomitant agent in the CAZ-AVI group and TGC group was carbapenem (44.2% versus 62.9%, P = 0.058), while only a small proportion of the study population received CAZ-AVI and TGC monotherapy (20.9% versus 6.5%, P = 0.027). The clinical and microbiological cure rates of the CAZ-AVI group were superior to those of the TGC group [51.2% versus 29.0% (P = 0.022) and 74.4% versus 33.9% (P < 0.001), respectively]. No significant differences in the 28-day survival rates were identified between the two groups (69.8% versus 66.1%, P = 0.695). Conventional multivariate logistic regression and PS analyses showed that patients who had used CAZ-AVI were more likely to have achieved a clinical cure [4.767 (95%CI 1.694-13.414), P=0.003;3.405 (95%CI 1.304-8.889), P=0.012] and microbiological success [6.664 (95%CI 2.626-16.915), P<0.001;7.778 (95%CI 2.717-22.265), P<0.001] than patients who used TGC. However, the difference in the 28-day survival rates between the two groups was not significant. According to the safety evaluation findings, the CAZ-AVI group exhibited a generally lower incidence of adverse reactions compared with that in the TGC group. CONCLUSIONS: CAZ-AVI may be a suitable alternative for TGC in the treatment of critically ill patients with CRKP-induced HAP or VAP.

Originally suspected of having suffered an opiate overdose, it became clear that they were the victims of anti-cholinesterase poisoning-the Soviet era poison Novichok. Twenty-five days later, two further patients were admitted with the same symptoms. One of these patients died 8 days later and the second remained in hospital for 3 weeks. A Clinical Psychologist was present on the unit throughout the major incident and all staff directly involved received psycho-educational support regarding self-care. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the psychological impact of the longest running major incident in NHS history on the staff directly involved. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used, with structured questionnaires administered retrospectively. METHODS: A link to an electronic survey was emailed to every member of staff in the organization. The survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (to both the March and June events). RESULTS: 540/4000 hospital staff responded (13.5% response rate) with a 29/59 (49%) response rate in intensive care staff. Frontline staff had significantly lower scores on anxiety (P < .05 for the June incident), depressive symptoms (P < .05 March and June) and subscales of burnout than managers (depersonalization P < .05). On the remaining two burnout subscales and on anxiety scores for those involved in March, results trended towards significance (P < .1).

The internet and social media have become important sources of health-related information on COVID-19 and on protective behaviors. In addition, the COVID-19 infodemic is spreading faster than the coronavirus itself, which interferes with governmental health-related communication efforts. This jeopardizes national public health containment strategies. Therefore, digital health literacy is a key competence to navigate web-based COVID-19-related information and service environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate university students' digital health literacy and web-based information-seeking behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among 14,916 university students aged &#8805;18 years from 130 universities across all 16 federal states of Germany was conducted using a web-based survey. Along with sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, subjective social status), the measures included five subscales from the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI), which was adapted to the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Web-based information-seeking behavior was investigated by examining the web-based sources used by university students and the topics that the students searched for in connection with COVID-19. Data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Across digital health literacy dimensions, the greatest difficulties could be found for assessing the reliability of health-related information (5964/14,103, 42.3%) and the ability to determine whether the information was written with a commercial interest (5489/14,097, 38.9%). Moreover, the respondents indicated that they most frequently have problems finding the information they are looking for (4282/14,098, 30.4%). When stratified according to sociodemographic characteristics, significant differences were found, with female university students reporting a lower DHLI for the dimensions of \\"information searching\\" and \\"evaluating reliability.\\" Search engines, news portals, and websites of public bodies were most often used by the respondents as sources to search for information on COVID-19 and related issues. Female students were found to use social media and health portals more frequently, while male students used Wikipedia and other web-based encyclopedias as well as YouTube more often. The use of social media was associated with a low ability to critically evaluate information, while the opposite was observed for the use of public websites. CONCLUSIONS: Although digital health literacy is well developed in university students, a significant proportion of students still face difficulties with certain abilities to evaluate information. There is a need to strengthen the digital health literacy capacities of university students using tailored interventions. Improving the quality of health-related information on the internet is also key.","output":"Digital Health Literacy and Web-Based Information-Seeking Behaviors of University Students in Germany During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The digital age creates new challenges for journalists and science communicators that threaten to undermine their shared goals of providing trustworthy content to audiences.

To understand the molecular basis and host mechanism for the high virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals, we compared two H5N1 isolates which have similar genetic backgrounds but greatly differ in their virulence in mice. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 (GS10) is nonpathogenic. We first showed that CK10 elicited a more potent innate immune response than did GS10 in mouse lungs by increasing the number and expression levels of activated genes. We then generated a series of reassortants between the two viruses and evaluated their virulence in mice. Inclusion of the CK10 PA gene in the GS10 background resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence. Conversely, expression of the GS10 PA gene in the CK10 background significantly attenuated the virulence. These results demonstrated that the PA gene mainly determines the pathogenicity discrepancy between CK10 and GS10 in mice. We further determined that arginine (R) at position 353 of the PA gene contributes to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. The reciprocal substitution at position 353 in PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene largely caused the transfer of viral phenotypes, including virus replication, polymerase activity, and manipulation of the innate response, between CK10 and GS10. We therefore defined a novel molecular marker associated with the high virulence of H5N1 influenza viruses, providing further insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammals.","output":"The PA-gene-mediated lethal dissemination and excessive innate immune response contribute to the high virulence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to gain momentum around the world, several measures are being put in place to control its spread.

Moreover, there are potential public health concerns associated with these walkthrough gates. Spraying individuals with disinfectant chemicals is strongly discouraged by various health authorities around the globe because of their propensity for eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm following inhalation, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting.

The results indicate that these representations vary and are associated with the media channel and the effect the reception produces on mood and mental health. A total of 80 interviews and 1,068 online survey forms were applied in different regions of Colombia. The qualitative phase showed that the programs or messages received were represented positively when they came from audiovisual entertainment and contributed to the family unit and reduced stress during the lockdown. Meanwhile, media reception was represented negatively when the messages or news came from journalism or social networks and increased the misinformation, anxiety, and fear of contagion. The quantitative phase found that media reception decreased as the lockdown continued, due to information saturation and the proliferation of news emphasizing the risks of COVID-19.

Based on the real data, the parameters of the model are estimated. In this paper, the trust-region-reflective algorithm is applied for parameter estimation. After that, based on these calculated parameters, the prediction is made under three scenarios of the control measures and one scenario without any control measures. Unlike the previous models in which the effects of control action is not quantified, the proposed model can do this in order to better predict the evolution of this pandemic.

Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. FINDINGS: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 400% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 394-407) to 503% (500-505), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 463% (95% UI 461-465) in 2017, compared with 287% (285-290) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253a000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 886% (95% UI 872-897) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 761% (95% UI 716-807) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 539% (506-596) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

Behavior change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favor the more rapid adoption of behavioral innovations. We analyze a simple model of coupled behavior-change and infection in a structured population characterized by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioral divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behavior-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a second wave in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals complex dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarized populations such as the United States.","output":"Coupled Dynamics of Behavior and Disease Contagion Among Antagonistic Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel ?-coronavirus, is the main pathogenic agent of the rapidly spreading pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

For performance assessment, two studies were performed. First, IgG (glycoprotein, a model protein similar to that of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2) was incubated under UV and heat sterilization. An incubation with UV at 70 C for 15 min was found to be effective in unfolding and aggregation of the protein. At optimized condition, the hydrodynamic size of the protein increased to ~171 nm from ~5 nm of the native protein. Similarly, the OD(280) values also increased from 0.17 to 0.78 indicating the exposure of more aromatic moieties and unfolding of the protein. The unfolding and aggregation of the protein were further confirmed by the intrinsic fluorescence measurement and FTIR studies, showing a 70% increase in the -sheets and a 22% decrease in the -helixes of the protein. The designed box was effective in damaging the protein's native structure indicating the effective inactivation of the SARS-COV-2.

It is known to cause skin lesions when the blood levels are more than 3000 mg/dl. It is also associated with 1 to 10 percent cases of acute pancreatitis and 10 to 20 percent when levels are higher than 2000 mg/dl. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year old morbidly obese man with medication non-compliance was evaluated by a dermatologist via a video tele visit due to COVID19 Pandemic. He has a history of uncontrolled IDDM, hypertriglyceridemia status post plasmapheresis a year ago associated with pancreatitis. He has no family history of hypertriglyceridemia. He reported rashes on his forearms and thighs for 3 weeks and was advised to go to the Emergency Department to rule out cutaneous manifestation of his underlying conditions. He initially reported epigastric pain radiating to his back, but his lipase and CT abdomen were negative for pancreatitis. He was vitally stable, and his exam was significant for yellowish papules on his forearms, legs bilaterally with erythematous borders. Labs: TGL 1618, total cholesterol 647, Glucose 223, A1c 12.6%, no Anion Gap.Imaging: Splenomegaly with Hepatic Steatosis likely due to TGL deposition.Patient was placed on Insulin drip to prevent pancreatitis and was started on fenofibrate, fish oil and rosuvastatin. Kept NPO initially with dextrose infusion to increase insulin drip & metabolize the triglycerides. Triglycerides gradually improved, and insulin drip was d/c. Shave Biopsy confirmed Eruptive Xanthoma. DISCUSSION: Eruptive xanthomas are characterized by an eruption of yellowish skin papules, encircled by an erythematous halo, most commonly arising over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, buttocks and shoulders in the setting of high triglyceride levels secondary to diabetes, diet or familial causes. The lipid deposits in these xanthomas are derived from circulating plasma lipoproteins. CONCLUSIONS: This case was unique as our patient developed eruptive xanthomas even at TGL level under 2000 mg/dl which is rarely seen. Clinically diagnosing Xanthomas are extremely important in order to treat hypertriglyceridemia in order to prevent pancreatitis, which has a grim prognosis. It is also important for reducing CAD risk. Xanthomas should be evaluated to prevent pancreatitis and long-term cardiac events rather than the lipid deposit itself. They can also be the only signs of underlying metabolic diseases like diabetes. Management should include pharmacological agents, counseling for compliance, nutrition & lifestyle modifications. All these patients with high TGLs will benefit from E3/E4 genotype testing as it is associated with higher cardiac disease and low response to statins.

MGAT1 is the GlcNAc-transferase that initiates complex and hybrid N-glycan synthesis. We show here that Drosophila MGAT1 was also inhibited by MGAT4D-L in S2 cells. In mammalian cells, expression of MGAT4D-L causes the substrate of MGAT1 (Man5GlcNAc2Asn) to accumulate on glycoproteins, a change that is detected by the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). Using GNA binding as an assay for the inhibition of MGAT1 in MGAT4D-L transfectants, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine requirements for MGAT1 inhibition. Deletion of 25 aa from the C-terminus inactivated MGAT4D-L, but deletion of 20 aa did not. Conversion of the five key amino acids (PSLFQ) to Ala, or deletion of PSLFQ in the context of full length MGAT4D-L, also inactivated MGAT1 inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, mutant, inactive MGAT4D-L interacted with MGAT1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The PSLFQ sequence also occurs in MGAT4A and MGAT4B GlcNAc-transferases. However, neither inhibited MGAT1 in transfected CHO cells. MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity could be partially transferred by attaching PSLFQ or the 25 aa C-terminus of MGAT4D-L to the C-terminus of MGAT1. Mutation of each aa in PSLFQ to Ala identified both Leu and Phe as independently essential for MGAT4D-L activity. Thus, replacement of either Leu395 or Phe396 with Ala led to inactivation of MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of MGAT1 by MGAT4D-L, and for the development of small molecule inhibitors of MGAT1.","output":"Point Mutations that Inactivate MGAT4D-L, an Inhibitor of MGAT1 and Complex N-Glycan Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Creating psychologically safe spaces for pre-service teachers to talk about their hopes, dreams and tensions of becoming teachers is complex work that requires teacher educators to engage with a range of pedagogical practices.

In recent years, non-invasive access to the molecular drivers of health versus disease has emboldened the goal of precision health, which draws on concepts borrowed from process monitoring in engineering, wherein hundreds of sensors can be employed to develop a model which can be used to preventatively detect and diagnose problems. In translating this monitoring regime from inanimate machines to human beings, precision health posits that continual and on-the-spot monitoring are the next frontiers in molecular medicine. Early biomarker detection and clinical intervention improves individual outcomes and reduces the societal cost of treating chronic and late-stage diseases. However, in current clinical settings, methods of disease diagnoses and monitoring are typically intermittent, based on imprecise risk factors, or self-administered, making optimization of individual patient outcomes an ongoing challenge. Low-cost molecular monitoring devices capable of on-the-spot biomarker analysis at high frequencies, and even continuously, could alter this paradigm of therapy and disease prevention. When these devices are coupled with molecular imaging, they could work together to enable a complete picture of pathogenesis. To meet this need, an active area of research is the development of sensors capable of point-of-care diagnostic monitoring with an emphasis on clinical utility. However, a myriad of challenges must be met, foremost, an integration of the highly specialized molecular tools developed to understand and monitor the molecular causes of disease with clinically accessible techniques. Functioning on the principle of probe-analyte interactions yielding a transducible signal, probes enabling sensing and imaging significantly overlap in design considerations and targeting moieties, however differing in signal interpretation and readout. Integrating molecular sensors with molecular imaging can provide improved data on the personal biomarkers governing disease progression, furthering our understanding of pathogenesis, and providing a positive feedback loop toward identifying additional biomarkers and therapeutics.

However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019.

The authors examine differences between pre-pandemic and 2021-2022 offerings among district subgroups in the areas of summer programming, tutoring, grade retention practices, technology-related services, student health and weekend meals, academic recovery measures, and scheduling. The authors also found that most district leaders did not perceive a strong parental demand for changes to their children's schooling;however, there were some notable exceptions among leaders of urban, suburban, and majority-students of color districts, even though the correlation between perceived demand and district provision is currently weak. Parents' demands may still change public education in the long run, but the authors did not find evidence for this thus far.

We included randomized controlled trials of adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery. We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality at the longest follow-up: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76-1.05; P=0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The intervention reduced the rate of three morbidities (renal failure, respiratory failure, and wound infections) but not the rates of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, venous thrombosis, and other types of infections. The number of patients with complications was also reduced by the intervention. Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by 1.16 days. There was no difference in critical care length of stay. The primary analysis of this review showed no difference between groups but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and was dominated by a single large study. Patients receiving this intervention stayed in hospital 1 day less with fewer complications. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.","output":"Perioperative increase in global blood flow to explicit defined goals and outcomes after surgery: a Cochrane Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained hospital resources and necessitated the need for predictive models to forecast patient care demands in order to allow for adequate staffing and resource allocation.

METHODS In a 1-year period, 461 MS patients (261 women; mean age 45.4 years, range 21-79) with CCSVI underwent endovascular treatment of 1012 venous lesions during 495 procedures [34 (6.9%) reinterventions]. While balloon angioplasty was preferred, 98 stents were implanted in 76 patients for lesion recoil, restenosis, or suboptimal dilation. The procedures were analyzed for incidences of major adverse events (death, major bleeding, or clinical deterioration of MS), access site complications, procedure-related complications, and procedural safety-related variables (fluoroscopy and contrast times). The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods. RESULTS There were no deaths, major bleeding events, or clinical deterioration of MS. Access site complications included limited groin hematoma (5, 1.0%); there were no arteriovenous fistulas or puncture site infections. Systemic complications included only rare cardiac arrhythmias (6, 1.2%). Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), acute in-stent/in-segment thrombosis (8, 1.6%), and acute recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI.

However, there are few clinical case reports of poisoning caused by mixed household disinfectants. This study summarized the clinical characteristics and treatment effects of chlorine poisoning caused by improper mixing of hypochlorite bleach with acidic cleaning agents to improve the understanding of the disease. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the basic data, clinical symptoms, treatment methods, imaging, and other clinical data of seven patients with chlorine poisoning, caused by an improper mixture of hypochlorite bleach and acidic cleaning agents, who were admitted to the National Army Poisoning Treatment Center. Results The seven patients (three men and four women) had an average age of 48.8 years (18C67 years). The average poisoning time (time from exposure to poison to treatment) was 57 h (4C240 h). All seven patients were involved in cleaning bathrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral lung effusions or inflammatory changes in five patients and no obvious exudation or inflammatory changes in two. The partial pressure of oxygen decreased in six patients, and respiratory failure occurred in one. Five patients had different degrees of increase in white blood cell count. For treatment, humidified oxygen therapy, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, intravenous corticosteroids, inhaled hormone, bronchial spasmolytics, antibiotics, and other symptomatic and supportive treatments were provided. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days (4C9 days). All seven patients recovered and were discharged. Conclusions Improper mixing of house disinfectants during the COVID-19 pandemic may cause damage to the respiratory system due to chlorine poisoning. Corticosteroids may improve lung exudation in severe cases. Additionally, symptomatic supportive treatment should be performed early.","output":"Chlorine poisoning caused by improper mixing of household disinfectants during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the necessity of the postoperative day-1 (POD1) review after pars plana vitrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis included available literature that documented medical and surgical interventions performed on POD1 review after pars plana vitrectomy. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted using a binomial-normal model to analyze three data sets consisting of all interventions, medical interventions, and surgical interventions. Heterogeneity and publication bias analyses were performed. RESULTS: POD1 reviews of 2,262 patients across 14 studies were examined to yield a total POD1 intervention rate estimate of 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-13.9). When stratified by medical or surgical intervention, the intervention rate estimates were 4.1% (95% CI, 1.4-11.6) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.3), respectively. The most common complication requiring postoperative intervention was elevated intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Given the wide confidence intervals of the estimated intervention rates, variability in postoperative practices, and range of interventions performed, the POD1 review cannot be discarded in its entirety.

Therefore, actions to make use of this resource more efficient become necessary. The most used methods of Building Energy Modeling (BEM) designated to assess the functionality of such actions are excessively complex and, in many cases, generate unreliable results. Thus, this work aims to elaborate an approach based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve energy efficiency in buildings in a simplified and user-oriented manner. For this purpose, a case study was developed in which two classrooms of an educational building, located in the Amazon region - Brazil, were subjected to three-dimensional modeling and energy simulations in BIM software. In addition to evaluating the classrooms' current performance regarding daylight, thermal conditions and energy consumption, such simulations intended to assess the implantation of two strategies that sought to reduce energy consumption and maintain thermal and visual comfort by taking advantage of daylight and natural ventilation. Besides of energy saving, such strategies were chosen as they promote Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and help to mitigate the indoor transmission of infectious agents, which is fundamental due to the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, especially in educational environments. The results showed that the strategy based on daylight contribution generated energy savings of around 8% for one of the rooms, and 12% for the other, while the one that exploited the use of natural ventilation was able to reduce energy consumption by about 7% for one of the rooms, and 9% for the other. Therefore, this research presents an important contribution as it provides an intelligible workflow that makes the energy simulation process friendlier and more intuitive and that was able to generate plausible results using BIM-BEM interoperability.","output":"Building Information Modeling approach to optimize energy effciency in educational buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced coastal communities around the world to re-evaluate their approaches to marine conservation and marine protected area (MPA) management. Initial studies have called for the need for improved social-ecological resilience of MPAs to improve the adaptive capacity of communities and ecosystems to respond to future crises. However, as posed by Armitage and Johnson (2006), it is critical that MPA managers ask the question for what and for whom are we trying to promote resilience? in designing more resilient MPAs for a post-pandemic world. Based on a systematic literature review of marine reserve impacts and supported by fieldwork conducted in the Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, this study examines what opportunities for transformations in MPA management and governance have emerged, and how MPAs can focus on incorporating principles of equitable resilience as they build back from the pandemic. The findings demonstrate how equitable resilience can be undermined when the voices and interests of local communities are sidelined in favour of powerful interest groups such as tourism or NGOs. Ultimately, the paper concludes that planning for resilience in MPAs must synchronize with local realities to better realize the potential for system transformation and a reimagining of MPA capacity to better serve local communities.","output":"Marine Reserves and Resilience in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. In most cases, loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene that encodes lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 are responsible for the disease, and more than half of the mutations are considered to interfere with the biogenesis or folding of the protein. We previously identified a series of oxysterol derivatives and phenanthridine-6-one derivatives as pharmacological chaperones, i.e., small molecules that can rescue folding-defective phenotypes of mutated NPC1, opening up an avenue to develop chaperone therapy for Niemann-Pick disease type C. Here, we present an improved image-based screen for NPC1 chaperones and we describe its application for drug-repurposing screening. We identified some azole antifungals, including itraconazole and posaconazole, and a kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, as probable pharmacological chaperones. A photo-crosslinking study confirmed direct binding of itraconazole to a representative folding-defective mutant protein, NPC1-I1061T. Competitive photo-crosslinking experiments suggested that oxysterol-based chaperones and itraconazole share the same or adjacent binding site(s), and the sensitivity of the crosslinking to P691S mutation in the sterol-sensing domain supports the hypothesis that their binding sites are located near this domain. Although the azoles were less effective in reducing cholesterol accumulation than the oxysterol-derived chaperones or an HDAC inhibitor, LBH-589, our findings should offer new starting points for medicinal chemistry efforts to develop better pharmacological chaperones for NPC1.","output":"Image-based screen capturing misfolding status of Niemann-Pick type C1 identifies potential candidates for chaperone drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly altered peoples' daily lives, and it continues spreading as a crucial concern globally. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are related to individuals' adherence to government measures.

Among the eligible respondents (n = 362), 52.8% were female, 79.0% were undergraduate students, 32.9% were students whose major university subjects were biology-related, 35.4% were from the capital region, and 83.7% were Japanese. The overall KAP of university students in Japan was high. All respondents (100%) showed they possessed knowledge on avoiding enclosed spaces, crowded areas, and close situations. Most respondents showed a moderate or higher frequency of washing their hands or wearing masks (both at 96.4%). In addition, 68.5% of respondents showed a positive attitude toward early drug administration. In the logistic regressions, gender, major subjects, education level, nationality, residence, and psychological factors (private self-consciousness and extroversion) were associated with knowledge or attitudes toward COVD-19 (p < 0.05). In the logistic and multiple linear regressions, capital regions, high basic knowledge, high information acquisition, correct information explanations contributed positively to preventative action (p < 0.05). Non-capital regions, male gender, non-bio-backgrounds, high public self-consciousness, high advanced knowledge, incorrect information explanations, and high extroversion contributed negatively to self-restraint (p < 0.05). Moreover, self-restraint was decreasing over time. These findings clarify the Japanese university students' KAP and the related factors in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they may help university managers, experts, and policymakers control the future spread of COVID-19 and other emerging infections.","output":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 among university students in Japan and associated factors: An online cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface.

Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.","output":"Whence the next pandemic?

These evaluations typically occur in an emergency department (ED), but there is increasing interest in providing this care in other settings. We report on a novel care model whereby a nursing hotline is used to triage patients to the ED or to the North Carolina Cancer Hospital Infusion Center (NCCHIC). METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients with a neoplasm diagnosis seeking acute care at a large academic hospital pre- and post-initiation of the novel care model in January of 2016. Patients were identified by querying the electronic medical record and clinic administrative data during matched 6 month pre- and post-periods. RESULTS: During the pre-initiation period, 1346 patients visited the ED on 1651 occasions (76.1% admission rate). In the post-initiation period, 1434 patients visited the ED on 1797 occasions (81.5% admission rate), and 246 patients visited the NCCHIC on 322 occasions (68.9% admission rate).

These changes prompted the development of a virtual urology sub-internship rotation our institution for visiting fourth year medical students. The purpose of this study was to implement a virtual urologic surgery sub-internship program and evaluate medical student impressions of the experience. METHODS: A two-week urology curriculum was created with content delivered by two-way, interactive videoconferencing. The curriculum included synchronous and individual learning with live patient clinical experiences in the outpatient clinic and operating room, faculty lectures, and departmental conferences. The students also completed self-reflective writing exercises and a grand rounds presentation. Student impressions of the rotation were assessed with an anonymous exit survey. Descriptive statistics were utilized to evaluate the 5-point Likert Scale responses, with 5 being strongly positive and 1 strongly negative. RESULTS: A total of 40 students applied for the rotation and 18 were selected for 1 of 5 two-week rotation blocks. All students successfully completed the rotation and received a Pass. Of the 18 students who participated in the virtual rotation, 16 (88.9%) completed the exit survey. The overall experience was rated as strongly positive by 14 of 16 (87.5%) students.

The sample mean age was 66 years; 67% were male. Increased exercise capacity at CR completion and follow-up was detected by a 6MWT change in mean distance (39 m and 42 m; p = 0.01, respectively). Increased PA participation at CR completion was detected by Fitbit-Flex mean change in step counts (1794; p = 0.01). Relative changes for Fitbit-Flex step counts and a 6MWT were consistent with previous research, demonstrating Fitbit-Flexs potential as an outcome measure. With four days of data, Fitbit-Flex had acceptable ICC values in measuring step counts and MVPA minutes. Fitbit-Flex steps and 6MWT meters are more responsive to changes in PA patterns following exposure to a cardiac rehabilitation program than Fitbit-Flex or PASE-estimated moderateCvigorous PA (MVPA) minutes. Fitbit-Flex step counts provide a useful additional measure for assessing PA outside of the CR setting and accounts for day-to-day variations. Two weekend days and two weekdays are needed for Fitbit-Flex to estimate PA levels more precisely.","output":"Comparison of Different Physical Activity Measures in a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program: A Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) have clinical features including older age, presence of medical comorbidities, susceptibility to infections, and thrombotic tendencies which are relevant when assessing their risk during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To study the vulnerability of patients with MGUS during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed the local management of MGUS patients and their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were performed for all patients with MGUS seen at a university medical center clinic (2014-2020). RESULTS: A total of 228 MGUS patients were included;211 patients are alive, 7 patients died before the pandemic, and 10 patients died since the pandemic declaration. The mean age and the overall survival (OS) of the patients who died before versus during the pandemic were 83.0 versus 75.2 years, p = 0.4, and OS 40.6 versus 53.2 months, p = 0.3, respectively. One patient died of COVID-19. Nine patients had venous thromboembolisms (VTE), all of which occurred before the pandemic onset.

We describe the methods and rationale for the Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement Network Trial with the aim to compare effectiveness of surgical modalities in paediatric nephrolithiasis based on stone clearance and lived patient experiences. This protocol serves as a patient-centred alternative to randomised controlled trials for interventions where clinical equipoise is lacking. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PKIDS is a collaborative learning organisation composed of 26 hospitals that is conducting a prospective pragmatic clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of ureteroscopy, shockwave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for youth aged 8C21 years with kidney and/or ureteral stones. Embedded within clinical care, the PKIDS trial will collect granular patient-level, surgeon-level and institution-level data, with a goal enrolment of 1290 participants over a 21-month period. The primary study outcome is stone clearance, defined as absence of a residual calculus of >4 mm on postoperative ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported physical, emotional and social health outcomes (primarily using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System), analgesic use and healthcare resource use. Timing and content of secondary outcomes assessments were set based on feedback from patient partners. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for stone clearance and patient-reported outcomes by participant and stone characteristics will be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the central institutional review board with reliance across participating sites. Participating stakeholders will review results and contribute to development dissemination at regional, national and international meetings.

Via 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, the experiment demonstrated that latex had a potent antioxidant activity with the IC(50) 43.9 g/mL for scavenging DPPH. Hemolysis inhibition was 58.5% at 1000 g/mL of latex compared with 91.0% at 200 g/mL of indomethacin as positive control. Negligible anticoagulant properties of latex were reported where the recorded time was 11.9 s of prothrombin time (PT) and 29.2 s of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 25 g/mL, compared with the same concentration of heparin (PT 94.6 s and APPT 117.7 s). The anticancer potential of latex was recorded against PC-3 (97.11% toxicity) and MCF-7 (96.23% toxicity) at 1000 g/mL with IC(50) 48.26 g/mL and 40.31 g/mL, respectively. Disc diffusion assessment for antimicrobial activity recorded that the most sensitive tested microorganisms to latex were Bacillus subtilis followed by Escherichia coli, with an inhibition zone (IZ) of 31 mm with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (10.2 g/mL) and 30 mm (MIC, 12.51 g/mL), respectively.

This suggested that the mobilization of adaptive immunity by administered MAbs is key for the success in the long term for the MAb-based passive immunotherapy of chronic viral infections. We have addressed here whether the anti-FrCas(E) protective endogenous immunity is the mere consequence of viral propagation blunting, which would simply give time to the immune system to react, and/or to actual immunomodulation by the MAb during the treatment. To this aim, we have compared viral replication, disease progression, and antiviral immune responses between different groups of infected mice: (i) mice treated with either the 667 MAb, its F(ab')(2) fragment, or an IgM (672) with epitopic specificity similar to that of 667 but displaying different effector functions, and (ii) mice receiving no treatment but infected with a low viral inoculum reproducing the initial viral expansion observed in their infected/667 MAb-treated counterparts. Our data show that the reduction of FrCas(E) propagation is insufficient on its own to induce protective immunity and support a direct immunomodulatory action of the 667 MAb. Interestingly, they also point to sequential actions of the administered MAb. In a first step, viral propagation is exclusively controlled by 667 neutralizing activity, and in a second one, this action is complemented by FcgammaR-binding-dependent mechanisms, which most likely combine infected cell cytolysis and the modulation of the antiviral endogenous immune response. Such complementary effects of administered MAbs must be taken into consideration for the improvement of future antiviral MAb-based immunotherapies.","output":"Long-lasting protective antiviral immunity induced by passive immunotherapies requires both neutralizing and effector functions of the administered monoclonal antibody."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, our hospice services had to rapidly move to consulting using video-conferencing technology A service evaluation captured our patients experiences of video consultations provided by a range of hospice professionals MethodsAn online or postal survey was sent to a convenience sample of patients, who had participated in video consultations between March and June 2020, focussing on their experience and overall satisfaction with the service ResultsWe received 26 responses from patients (23) and family members/carers (3), 12 of whom were over the age of 70 Patients had consulted with our doctors (2), nurses (14), physiotherapists (5), occupational therapist (1), social worker (1), complementary therapist (4) and Wellbeing team (17) 25 respondents stated that they used the internet daily, 22 had access to a smartphone, and 23 used videoconferencing for reasons other than healthcare However, 22 had never used this technology for healthcare prior to the pandemic 32% included a family member in their consultation and this was viewed as beneficial 88 4% experienced being able to talk in the same way as if they were face-to-face All respondents reported overall satisfaction with consulting via video, although 41 7% still stated a preference for face-to-face consultations where possible 91 7% said they would be happy to use video to consult with hospice professionals in the future, and 87 5% stated that they would recommend this service video to others ConclusionsPatients and carers reported video consultations to be an acceptable way to receive support from a range of hospice professionals The majority had access to, and familiarity with their own technology Video consultations should be offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations with the potential to improve access for more patients and carers to a range of hospice services in the future","output":"114 A service evaluation of video consultations in a UK hospice during the Covid-19 pandemic: learning from patients and carers feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E\\\\learning strategies have become an important part of biomedical education.

We previously determined that placental expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and associated viral cell entry regulators is upregulated by hypoxia. In the present study, we utilized a clinically relevant model of SARS-CoV-2-associated chronic histiocytic intervillositis/massive perivillous fibrin deposition (CHIV/MPFVD) to test the hypothesis that placental hypoxia may facilitate placental SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed a comparative immunohistochemical and/or RNAscope in-situ hybridization analysis of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX, hypoxia marker), ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 expression in free-floating versus fibrin-encased chorionic villi in a 20-weeks gestation placenta with SARS-CoV-2-associated CHIV/MPVFD. RESULTS: The levels of CAIX and ACE2 immunoreactivity were significantly higher in trophoblastic cells of fibrin-encased villi than in those of free-floating villi, consistent with hypoxia-induced ACE2 upregulation. SARS-CoV-2 showed a similar preferential localization to trophoblastic cells of fibrin-encased villi. DISCUSSION: The localization of SARS-CoV-2 to hypoxic, fibrin-encased villi in this placenta with CHIV/MPVFD suggests placental infection and, therefore, transplacental SARS-CoV-2 transmission may be promoted by hypoxic conditions, mediated by ACE2 and similar hypoxia-sensitive viral cell entry mechanisms.

We show the application of this methodology to different stationary fractionally differenced financial data. We argue that our result is useful to understand the dependencies across three different aspects of financial risk, namely market risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk. Indeed, we show how the resulting visualization is a useful tool for risk managers depicting dependency asymmetries between different risk factors and accounting for delayed cross dependencies. The constructed multilayer network shows a strong interconnection between the volumes and prices layers across all the stocks considered while a lower number of interconnections between the uncertainty measures is identified.","output":"A New Multilayer Network Construction via Tensor Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meteorological variables, such as the ambient temperature and humidity, play a well-established role in the seasonal transmission of respiratory viruses and influenza in temperate climates Since the onset of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing body of literature has attempted to characterize the sensitivity of COVID-19 to meteorological factors and thus understand how changes in the weather and seasonality may impede COVID-19 transmission Here we select a subset of this literature, summarize the diversity in these studies' scopes and methodologies, and show the lack of consensus in their conclusions on the roles of temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors on COVID-19 transmission dynamics We discuss how several aspects of studies' methodologies may challenge direct comparisons across studies and inflate the importance of meteorological factors on COVID-19 transmission We further comment on outstanding challenges for this area of research and how future studies might overcome them by carefully considering robust modeling approaches, adjusting for mediating and covariate effects, and choosing appropriate scales of analysis","output":"Associations between meteorology and COVID-19 in early studies: Inconsistencies, uncertainties, and recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This study aims to understand the theme park visitors perceived robotic qualities featured in four different robots, assess their robotic functions and consumers loyalty toward four different robotic server types.Design/methodology/approach>A structured online survey of 399 respondents measured and compared consumer perceptions related to qualities and functions of robots in a theme park context and consumers behavioral intentions in four different robotic scenarios C anime, cartoon-like, human-like and animal-like robots in theme parks.

STUDY DESIGN: Mechanical testing of five types of commercial prosthetic feet across nine user body weight and foot size combinations. METHODS: Linear forefoot and heel stiffness (force vs. displacement) data were collected for 41 prosthetic feet. Quasistatic testing was conducted at -15 and +20 degrees to isolate loading of the heel and forefoot, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, there was a significant relationship between user body weight and both forefoot and heel stiffness, when adjusted for foot size and type (P < 0.001). However, there were a substantial number of inconsistencies across foot type within example user body weight and foot sizes combination. Furthermore, the relative order of forefoot stiffness across foot type differed from the relative order of heel stiffness across foot type.

The aim of this study was to compare the activity of our EGS service before and after these changes. METHODS Patients referred by the emergency department were identified prospectively over a 4-week period beginning from the date our EGS service was reconfigured (COVID) and compared with patients identified retrospectively from the same period the previous year (Pre-COVID), and followed up for 30 days. Data were extracted from handover documents and electronic care records. The primary outcomes were the rate of admission, ambulation and discharge. RESULTS There were 281 and 283 patients during the Pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively. Admission rate decreased from 78.7% to 41.7%, while there were increased rates of ambulation from 7.1% to 17.3% and discharge from 6% to 22.6% (all p<0.001). For inpatients, mean duration of admission decreased (6.9 to 4.8 days), and there were fewer operative or endoscopic interventions (78 to 40). There were increased ambulatory investigations (11 to 39) and telephone reviews (0 to 39), while early computed tomography scan was increasingly used to facilitate discharge (5% vs 34.7%).

Variability in exacerbation diagnoses and treatment have led drug developers to employ objective exacerbation definitions combining antimicrobial treatment (AT) and the presence of 4 of 12 respiratory criteria (first published by Fuchs et al. [NEJM 1994;331(10):637C42]). Assumptions underlying this approach have yet to be formally evaluated. METHODS: Respiratory events (RE) observed during a 48-week trial of ataluren (NCT02139306), a read-through agent for premature nonsense codons, were compared across six exacerbation definitions: any AT, intravenous AT (IVAT), 4 Fuchs criteria present, AT plus 4 Fuchs criteria, IVAT plus 4 Fuchs criteria, and investigator assessment. Fuchs definitions were evaluated by assessing missingness of individual criteria and associations between criteria presence and clinician exacerbation assessment. RESULTS: Among 751 RE, more than one third had 4 Fuchs criteria present but were not assessed as exacerbations by investigators. Data for 1 and for 4 Fuchs criteria, respectively, were missing for ~ 90% and >30% of RE. Only 6/12 Fuchs criteria were present more often when investigators assessed RE as exacerbations than when they did not. CONCLUSIONS: Objective definitions have shortcomings inconsistent with their purpose of optimizing exacerbation capture in clinical trials : 1) they capture events clinicians do not consider exacerbations, 2) are prone to data missingness which can bias the likelihood of meeting the definition, and 3) employ criteria that are not associated with investigator assessment of exacerbation.","output":"Evaluating assumptions of definition-based pulmonary exacerbation endpoints in cystic fibrosis clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The close link between human resources for health and the performance of health systems calls for a comprehensive study of the labor market. This paper proposes a performance metric for the nursing labor market, measures its magnitude and analyzes its predictors over the last 15 years. DESIGN AND METHODS: A repeated cross-sectional analysis using data from the quarterly population-based National Survey of Occupation and Employment 2005C2019 (ENOE in Spanish). An aggregate total of 19,311 Mexican nurses (population N = 4,816,930) was analyzed. Nursing labor market performance was defined as the level of non-precarious employment of nurses in the health sector. After describing the sociodemographic, labor and contextual characteristics of the nurses surveyed, we identified the key correlates of market performance using repeated cross-sectional multiple logistic regression analysis. We then estimated the adjusted prevalence of market performance according to the survey period and socioeconomic region of residence. RESULTS: The exogenous indicators analyzed shed light on various aspects of the market structure. Unemployment remained stable at 5% during the period examined, but underemployment rose by 26% and precarious employment, our endogenous indicator, also grew significantly. On the whole, our indicators revealed a notable deterioration in the structure of the nursing labor market; they varied by age and sex as well as between public and private institutions. Although the steepest deterioration occurred in the private sector, we observed an increase in precarious jobs among public institutions formerly protective of employment conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The deterioration of the labor market jeopardizes the ability of nursing professionals to participate in the market as well as to obtain secure jobs once they do enter. The Mexican Health System suffers from a chronic dearth of nurses, reducing its capacity to achieve its core objectives including enhanced coverage and increased effectiveness.

The number of registered cases is increasing and almost no country or territory worldwide has been without any COVID-19 patient. The aim of this study was to examine the level of knowledge on the SARS-COv-2 and COVID-19 among medical students and to explore the differences in attitudes, practices and fear of COVID-19 among students with sufficient and students with insufficient knowledge. METHODOLOGY: The cross-sectional study among the 1,722 medical students was conducted through an online platform of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade. The instrument used was a questionnaire with sections on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 and the Fear of COVID-19 scale. RESULTS: Total of 1576 (91.50%) students were in the sufficient knowledge group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between the sufficient knowledge on COVID-19 and female sex (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.18-2.45), age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18), considering the preventive measures enforced in Serbia as good (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.18-5.56), wearing the surgical mask outside of the household in the past 14 days (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.22-2.87) and score on Fear of COVID-19 scale (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.98).

First of all, given the immunosuppressive effect of many therapies that are normally administered to patients with hematological diseases, with a consequent increased risk of contracting a more severe viral infection, it has been necessary to reconsider in each individual patient the urgency and priority of the treatments foreseen by the normal standards of care. In particular, as regards allogeneic (and to a lesser extent autologous) hematopoietic cell transplantation and CAR T-cell therapy, specific recommendations have been issued by the transplant community on the criteria to be used to decide whether or not to postpone these procedures and on the clinical management of recipients and donors exposed to COVID-19. As to cytotoxic chemotherapy and other antineoplastic therapies, criteria have been proposed to decide, in the various clinical situations, which treatments were not deferrable and which instead could be postponed or replaced by less aggressive therapies. In the outpatient clinics, various organizational solutions for telemedicine have been adopted, resorting to telephone interviews and/or Information Technology, with the aim of reducing the influx of patients while maintaining an adequate control of their clinical condition. The collection of blood by the transfusion centers has been the subject of organizational measures, in order to avoid the transmission of COVID 19 while maintaining a sufficient blood collection for clinical needs.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19Cpositive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","output":"Identification of Risk Factors and Symptoms of COVID-19: Analysis of Biomedical Literature and Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current digest focuses on the studies of mental health in the population in the context of changes brought by the pandemic of COVID-19 We consider new data yielded by foreign studies on the most vulnerable groups (Translated by Elena Mozhaeva)","output":"The Coronavirus Crisis: Lockdown and Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between April 20, 2020 and June 19, 2020 we conducted a survey of the membership of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on their research and academic careers.

Four thousand seven hundred and seventy-one inhabitants of Mexico, with paid employment, under lockdown, answered a set of instruments via the Internet that evaluated positive and negative psychological factors in addition to SW. Based on correlation and multiple regression analysis, models were proposed for men and women, which were tested by path analysis. Results. Both models successfully fit the data and explained a high proportion of the SW variance. Spiritual strength was the best predictor, mainly for women, while the capacity for enjoyment was central to the models, mediating the effect of empathy and depression. Discussion and conclusion. SW is significantly predicted by the factors studied, especially spiritual strength and capacity for enjoyment, which seem to provide men and women with fortitude and meaning of life in adverse circumstances such as today's.","output":"Subjective well-being in men and women during the COVID-19 lockdown: A structural model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structural and functional alterations of microvessels are detected because of physiological aging and in several cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The small resistance arteries of these patients show an increase in the media or total wall thickness to internal lumen diameter ratio (MLR or WLR), often accompanied by endothelial dysfunction. For decades, micromyography has been considered as a gold standard method for evaluating microvascular structural alterations through the measurement of MLR or WLR of subcutaneous small vessels dissected from tissue biopsies. Micromyography is the most common and reliable method for assessing microcirculatory endothelial function ex vivo, while strain-gauge venous plethysmography is considered the reference technique for in vivo studies. Recently, several noninvasive methods have been proposed to extend the microvasculature evaluation to a broader range of patients and clinical settings. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry and adaptive optics are increasingly used to estimate the WLR of retinal arterioles. Microvascular endothelial function may be evaluated in the retina by flicker light stimulus, in the finger by tonometric approaches, or in the cutaneous or sublingual tissues by laser Doppler flowmetry or intravital microscopy. The main limitation of these techniques is the lack of robust evidence on their prognostic value, which currently reduces their widespread use in daily clinical practice. Ongoing and future studies will overcome this issue, hopefully moving the noninvasive assessment of the microvascular function and structure from bench to bedside.","output":"New Noninvasive Methods to Evaluate Microvascular Structure and Function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper performs a systematic investigation into the temporal evolution of severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic considering 15 diverse countries.

Our results show that this dynamics varies widely along the SFCP from the lower-right region, characterized by high entropy and low degree of reliability in relation to the information extracted from the analyzed data set to the top-right region, characterized by the less entropic and high degree of reliability in relation to the information extracted from the analyzed data set.

Exclusion of all transgender or DSD athletes is contrary to the Olympic charter and unlawful in many countries. While having no gender eligibility rules, sport loses its meaning and near-universal support.

Wearing a mask can effectively reduce the probability of being infected by the virus. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor whether people wear masks in public to prevent the virus from spreading further. However, there is no mature general mask wearing detection algorithm. Based on tiny YOLOv3 algorithm, this paper realizes the detection of face with mask and face without mask, and proposes an improvement to the algorithm. First, the loss function of the bounding box regression is optimized, and the original loss function is optimized as the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) loss. Second, the network structure is improved, the residual unit is introduced into the backbone to increase the depth of the network and the detection of two scales is expanded to three. Finally, the size of anchor boxes is clustered based on k -means algorithm. The experimental results on the constructed dataset show that, compared with the tiny YOLOv3 algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy while maintaining high-speed inference ability.

Methods: We enroled 112 households (291 participants) in a case-ascertained study in Bergen, Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020, collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in sera collected 6-8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to define household attack rates. Findings: The overall attack rate was 45% (95% CI 38-53) assessed by serology, and 47% when also including seronegative RT-PCR positives. Serology identified a higher number of infected household members than RT-PCR. Attack rates were equally high in children (48%) and young adults (42%). The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members and 42% in RT-PCR negative contacts. Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults. The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever (aOR 3.31 [95% CI 1.52-7.24]; p = 0.003) or dyspnoea (aOR 2.25 [95% CI 1.80-4.62]; p = 0.027) during acute illness. Interpretation: Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT-PCR. Children are equally susceptible to infection as young adults.

As of March 9, 2020, this epidemic has occurred in 102 countries and caused 3584 deaths with global serious concern. To cope with the outbreak, Chinese governments have strictly controlled urban traffic at all levels, especially in Wuhan. This article firstly reviews the urban traffic situation from January 23, 2020 to March 8, 2020, including safety problems of urban public transportation, traffic control methods, and emergency public transportation planning. Based on this, we present some emergency traffic control measures that are very urgent in the early stage of epidemic. Between cities, we strongly recommend blocking and controlling the flow of traffic in the early stage of epidemic. Inside a city, it is imperative to suspend the public transports, block all roads, restrict private cars, and close bridges and tunnels. Material isolation transfer stations are suggested to be established. A number of public transports should be organized to ensure transport of medical workers, patients, and daily necessities. We also give suggestions about the long-term planning and improvement methods. Considering the great success China has achieved in fighting COVID-19, we believe that this article offers a valuable reference of urban traffic control.","output":"Controlling urban traffic-one of the useful methods to ensure safety in Wuhan based on COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common structural OA disorders globally. Incomplete understanding of the fundamental biological aspects of osteoarthritis underlies the current lack of effective treatment or disease modifying drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We implemented a systems approach by making use of the statistical network concepts in Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis to reconstruct the organization of the core proteome network in chondrocytes obtained from OA patients and healthy individuals. Protein modules reflect groups of tightly co-ordinated changes in protein abundance across healthy and OA chondrocytes. RESULTS: The unbiased systems analysis identified extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanosensing and glycolysis as two modules that are most highly correlated with &#927;&#913;. The ECM module was enriched in the OA genetic risk factors tenascin-C (TNC) and collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), as well as in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker associated with cartilage integrity. Mapping proteins that are unique to OA or healthy chondrocytes onto the core interactome, which connects microenvironment sensing and regulation of glycolysis, identified differences in metabolic and anti-inflammatory adaptation. CONCLUSION: The interconnection between cartilage ECM remodeling and metabolism is indicative of the dynamic chondrocyte states and their significance in osteoarthritis.","output":"Chondrocyte protein co-synthesis network analysis links ECM mechanosensing to metabolic adaptation in osteoarthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world held its breath for news surrounding COVID-19 and hunkered down amidst stay-at-home orders, medical students across the U.S. wondered if they would be called to serve on the front lines of the pandemic. Medical school administrators faced the challenge of protecting learners while also minimizing harm to their medical education. This balancing act raised critical questions in medical education as institutions reacted to changing guidelines. COVID-19 has punctuated already contentious areas of medical education and has forced institutions and organizations to take quick action. From the perspectives of a recent medical school graduate and current resident (ES) and a practicing clinician-educator (SHG), we examine the pandemic's impact on undergraduate medical education through an ethical lens. First, we explore the value of medical education, what drives this value, and how COVID-19 may alter it. We next consider student choice and how shifts toward utilitarianism in healthcare during a pandemic may affect learning and career exploration. Then, we inquire how access to technology may impact the experience of medical students from diverse backgrounds and varied institutions during a rapid shift to socially distanced learning. We identify vulnerabilities for students at several phases of the journey: premedical, preclinical, clinical, and preparation for residency. Finally, we address the hidden curriculum of COVID-19, its potential erosion of empathy among current medical students, and possible long-term consequences for future physicians and patients.","output":"COVID 19: A Cause for Pause in Undergraduate Medical Education and Catalyst for Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an important emerging respiratory pathogen.

The endosomotropic weak bases chloroquine and ammonium chloride do not prevent MHV4 infection. In marked contrast, we have selected variants from a neural cell line persistently infected with MHV4 which are entirely dependent on acid pH to fuse host cells and are strongly inhibited by endosomotropic weak bases. Wild-type and variant viruses were compared at the level of the fusion-active surface (S) glycoprotein gene. Cloning and sequencing of each 4,131-base open reading frame predicted a total of eight amino acid differences which fell into three distinct clusters. Each S glycoprotein, when expressed from cDNA, was synthesized in equivalent amounts, and similar proportions were transported to the cell surface. Wild-type S induced cell-cell fusion at neutral pH, whereas variant S required prolonged exposure to acidic pH to induce fusion. Expression of hybrid S genes prepared by exchange of restriction fragments between wild-type and variant cDNAs revealed that elimination of neutral pH fusion was solely dependent on amino acid alterations at positions 1067 (Q to H), 1094 (Q to H), and 1114 (L to R). These changes lie within a predicted heptad repeat region of the transmembrane cleavage fragment of S (S2).

A multicenter, age-matched, case-control study was therefore designed to explore the dynamic changes in laboratory parameters during the first 10 days after admission and identify early risk indicators for in-hospital mortality in this patient cohort. Methods Demographics and clinical data were extracted from the medical records of 93 pairs of patients who had been admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. These patients had either been discharged or were deceased by March 3, 2020. Data from days 1, 4, 7, and 10 of hospital admission were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were employed to identify early risk indicators of in-hospital death in this cohort. Results On admission, in-hospital mortality was associated with five risk indicators (ORs in descending order): aspartate aminotransferase (AST, >32 U/L) 43.20 (95% CI: 2.63, 710.04); C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than 100 mg/L 13.61 (1.78, 103.941); lymphocyte count lower than 0.6109/L 9.95 (1.30, 76.42); oxygen index (OI) less than 200 8.23 (1.04, 65.15); and D-dimer over 1 mg/L 8.16 (1.23, 54.34). Sharp increases in D-dimer at day 4, accompanied by decreasing lymphocyte counts, deteriorating OI, and persistent remarkably high CRP concentration were observed among non-survivors during the early stages of hospital admission. Conclusions The potential risk factors of high D-dimer, CRP, AST, low lymphocyte count and OI could help clinicians identify patients at high risk of death early in the hospital admission.

Given the unknown incidence of adverse cardiac sequelae after COVID-19 infection in athletes, these leagues implemented a conservative return-to-play (RTP) cardiac testing program aligned with American College of Cardiology recommendations for all athletes testing positive for COVID-19. Objective: To assess the prevalence of detectable inflammatory heart disease in professional athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, using current RTP screening recommendations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study reviewed RTP cardiac testing performed between May and October 2020 on professional athletes who had tested positive for COVID-19. The professional sports leagues (Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football League, and the men's and women's National Basketball Association) implemented mandatory cardiac screening requirements for all players who had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to resumption of team-organized sports activities. Exposures: Troponin testing, electrocardiography (ECG), and resting echocardiography were performed after a positive COVID-19 test result. Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis. Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or stress echocardiography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process. Results: The study included 789 professional athletes (mean [SD] age, 25 [3] years; 777 men [98.5%]). A total of 460 athletes (58.3%) had prior symptomatic COVID-19 illness, and 329 (41.7%) were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (minimally symptomatic). Testing was performed a mean (SD) of 19 (17) days (range, 3-156 days) after a positive test result. Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes (3.8%; troponin, 6 athletes [0.8%]; ECG, 10 athletes [1.3%]; echocardiography, 20 athletes [2.5%]), necessitating additional testing; 5 athletes (0.6%) ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis, 3; pericarditis, 2) that resulted in restriction from play. No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides large-scale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations. While long-term follow-up is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved.","output":"Prevalence of Inflammatory Heart Disease Among Professional Athletes With Prior COVID-19 Infection Who Received Systematic Return-to-Play Cardiac Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks occur annually across the world, causing a global health challenge.

METHODS: The data (Na?=a?1,372) used in this paper comes from the 2013 Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset. Six intentions of protective behaviors (getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, washing hands, avoiding going to public settings, sanitizing home, and eating nutritional supplements) were investigated. Tobit and ordered logistic regressions were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respondents were most inclined to washing hands, followed by wearing a mask, avoiding going to public settings, getting vaccine, sanitizing their homes, and eating nutritional supplements. Perceived severity and individual's efficacy were positively correlated with all 6 behavioral intentions. Trust in authorities has positive effect on all the protective behaviors except sanitizing home. Moreover, perceived probability has positive relationships with overall intention, intention to wear mask, and intention to wash hands.

The most widely recognized mechanism is alternative splicing. However, genes may also employ noncanonical translational events to produce such products. Some of these mechanisms operate at the level of translational initiation. In prokaryotes, genes may include alternative ribosome-binding sites directing the synthesis of products that differ at the N terminus. In eukaryotes, in which ribosome-binding sites do not exist, leaky scanning allows the same kind of variation. Noncanonical elongation events can also generate products that differ at their C terminus (1C3). Such events include programmed readthrough of translational termination codons (4,5) translational frameshifts (6C9), and translational hops (10,11). In each case, the ribosome fails to follow normal rules of decoding, leading to the synthesis of a protein that is not encoded, in the normal sense, in the DNA. In this chapter, we will describe the methods employed in the identification and analysis of programmed translational frameshift sites, including their discovery, measurement of the efficiency of the events, and determination of the mechanism of the frameshift.","output":"Identification and Analysis of Frameshift Sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is a computer technology that immerses a user in a completely different reality. The application of VR in acute pain settings is well established. However, in chronic pain, the applications and outcome parameters influenced by VR are less clear. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to systematically identify all outcome parameters that are reported in relation to VR in patients with chronic pain. METHODS: A total of 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) were searched for relevant studies. Multilevel random-effect meta-analyses were performed, whereby the standardized mean difference was chosen as the effect size to denote the difference between measurements before and after a VR intervention. RESULTS: The initial database search identified 1430 studies, of which 41 (2.87%) were eventually included in the systematic review. Evidence has been found for the effects of VR on pain, functioning, mobility, functional capacity, psychological outcomes, quality of life, neuropsychological outcomes, and physical sensations. The overall effect size (a total of 194 effect sizes from 25 studies) based on a three level meta-analysis was estimated at 1.22 (95% CI 0.55-1.89; z=3.56; P<.001), in favor of improvements after a VR intervention. When categorizing effect sizes, the overall effect sizes were reported as follows: 1.60 (95% CI 0.83-2.36; z=4.09; P<.001) for the effect of VR on pain (n=31), 1.40 (95% CI 0.13-2.67; z=2.17; P=.03) for functioning (n=60), 0.49 (95% CI ?0.71 to 1.68; z=0.80; P=.42) for mobility (n=24), and 0.34 (95% CI ?1.52 to 2.20; z=0.36; P=.72) for functional capacity (n=21). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review revealed a broad range of outcome variables influenced by an intervention of VR technology, with statistically significant pain relief and improvements in functioning. These findings indicate that VR not only has applications in acute pain management but also in chronic pain settings, whereby VR might be able to become a promising first-line intervention as complementary therapy for patients with chronic pain.

There is no effective commercial vaccine against PEDV infection. In this study, we found that an aqueous leaf extract of M. oleifera (MOE) exhibited antiviral activity in response to PEDV infection at the stage of PEDV replication instead of attachment or internalization. Mechanistically, MOE suppressed the oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by PEDV infection and upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, which further led to less cell apoptosis. This study is the first report showing that MOE has antiviral potential as a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against PEDV infection. ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), one of the serious enteric diseases caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is responsible for enormous economic losses in the global swine industry. However, available commercial vaccines fail to protect pigs from PEDV infection due to the appearance of PEDV variants. Hence, it is necessary to find an effective and cost-efficient natural product to protect pigs from PEDV infection. In this study, we first found that an aqueous leaf extract of M. oleifera (MOE) exhibited antiviral activity in response to PEDV infection. Furthermore, time-of-addition experiments revealed that MOE inhibited PEDV replication rather than attachment and internalization. Mechanistically, MOE significantly suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by PEDV infection, and restored glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Importantly, the addition of MOE alleviated oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and resulted in fewer apoptotic cells during PEDV infection. These results indicated that MOE might be an effective anti-PEDV drug used to control PED disease and may be helpful in developing a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against PEDV.","output":"The Aqueous Leaf Extract of M. oleifera Inhibits PEDV Replication through Suppressing Oxidative Stress-Mediated Apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigrants choice of settlement in a new country can play a fundamental role in their socio-economic integration.

This research presents a methodology to perform a recommended geographic redistribution of immigrants to improve their chances of socio-economic integration. The proposed methodology adapts a data-driven algorithm developed by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University to allocate immigrants based on a socio-economic integration outcome across available locations. We extend their approach to study the immigration process between two developing countries. Specifically, we focus on the case of the arrival of immigrants from Venezuela to Colombia. We consider the absorptive capacity of locations in Colombia and include the health and education needs of immigrants in our analysis. From the application in the Venezuelan-Colombian context, we find that the proposed redistribution increases the probability that immigrants access formal employment by more than 50%. Furthermore, we identify variables associated with immigrants formal employment and discuss specific strategies to improve the probability of success of vulnerable immigrants.","output":"Immigrants resettlement in developing countries: A data-driven decision tool applied to the case of Venezuelan immigrants in Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to hijack the cellular gene expression system for their replication.

During viral infections, the activities of PABPs are manipulated by various viruses, subverting the host translation machinery or evading the cellular antiviral defense mechanism. Viruses harness PABPs by modifying their stability, complex formation with other translation initiation factors, or subcellular localization to promote viral mRNAs translation while shutting off or competing with host protein synthesis. For the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the PABPs roles during viral infection.

We propose a novel COVID-19 diagnosis approach with contrastive representation learning to effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference. Besides, we design an adaptive joint training strategy to integrate the classification loss, mixup loss, and contrastive loss. Through the joint loss function, we obtain the high-level representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening.

The sharp transition of PhD candidates to distance education caused difficulties in organising the educational process. The aim of this study was to analyse the methods of distance education for postgraduate students in the context of a COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of graduate students was conducted through specially-designed and semi-standardised interviews of focus groups of producers and consumers of educational services. The study showed that the process of adaptation of postgraduate students majoring in Physical Culture and Sports and Biology was much more difficult than in the major Educational, Pedagogical Sciences and Philology. The reasons for the problems of distance education of PhD candidates included the complexity of creating educational and methodological materials for distance learning;lack of a centralised system of certification and accreditation of electronic courses;insufficient motivation of teachers;shortage of teachers who could competently develop distance learning courses in higher education. The study identified opportunities to implement promising areas of online learning in the system of training of academic and teaching staff: retraining of a large proportion of the teaching staff, implementation of a system approach to the development of the online environment of educational institutions, development of skills and abilities to use educational content.

This is mainly due to COVID related complications. On the contrary, the public around the world have become more aware about maintaining proper hygiene by wearing masks , using hand wash and keeping themselves clean. As an audit, we conducted a retrospective analysis comparing neutropenic complications during the pre COVID and COVID times at our tertiary care cancer hospital. Methods: We collected data of febrile neutropenia admissions in ICU from March to July 2019-Non Covid (NC) and March to July 2020-Covid (C). The data collection was done including data on nadir total WBC count, use of GCSF, positive cultures, type of malignancy and deaths. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 22. Results: There were 15 patients in the NC dataset and 18 patients in the C dataset. The mean age of NC was 59 (SD-9.2) and that of C was 57. 3 (SD-14). The age and sex were comparable in both the groups. The number of solid organ malignancies constituted 5 (33.33%) in NC set and 8 (44.44%) in C set. The hematological malignancies constituted 10 in each of C and NC sets. Gram negative sepsis was seen in 26.67% and 22.22% in NC and C dataset respectively. There were 4 (26.67%) deaths in NC group and 5 (27.28%) C group. Growth factors were received by 9 (60%) patients in NC group and 15 (83.3%) patients in the C group (p=0.0005). There was no significant difference in the admission, complication and death rates in ICU when comparing the two groups. These results have been depicted in Table. Conclusions: Despite the precautions taken by community during the COVID times, we conclude that there was no significant difference in the neutropenic complications.

We aim to describe the perception of telemedicine by both surgical patients and providers to understand the preferences for future incorporation in future surgical practice. METHODS An anonymous survey was administered to providers that transitioned clinic visits to telemedicine encounters since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the study, patients who underwent video telemedicine appointments answered survey questions via telephone. RESULTS Twenty-six out of 36 (72.7%) providers responded. Over 75% reported that they could effectively communicate with patients over telemedicine. Six (23.1%) reported that they could adequately assess surgical sites. Of 361 patients, 187 consented to the study (consent rate 51.8%). Among patients, the most common result to choose a telemedicine appointment was to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission (84, 44.9%), though the minority reported that they would choose telemedicine after the pandemic (64, 34.2%). Those patients who would choose an in-person visit were more likely to have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score, body mass index, and use friends or family for transportation. In open-ended feedback, patients suggested that telemedicine would be better suited for long-term follow-up rather than the immediate postoperative setting.

CBS utilises both haem and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) as cofactors. Although haem does not participate directly in the catalytic process, it is vital for PLP binding to the enzyme and potentially also for CBS stability. Haem deficiency can therefore undermine CBS activity by impairing PLP binding and facilitating CBS degradation. Excess haem can also impair CBS activity by inhibiting it via CO resulting from haem induction of haem oxygenase 1 (HO 1), and by induction of a functional vitamin B(6) deficiency following activation of hepatic tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and subsequent utilisation of PLP by enhanced kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and kynureninase (Kynase) activities. CBS inhibition results in accumulation of the cardiovascular risk factor homocysteine (Hcy) and evidence is emerging for plasma Hcy elevation in patients with acute hepatic porphyrias. Decreased CBS activity may also induce a proinflammatory state, inhibit expression of haem oxygenase and activate the extrahepatic kynurenine pathway (KP) thereby further contributing to the Hcy elevation. The hypothesis predicts likely changes in CBS activity and plasma Hcy levels in untreated hepatic porphyria patients and in those receiving hemin or certain gene-based therapies. In the present review, these aspects are discussed, means of testing the hypothesis in preclinical experimental settings and porphyric patients are suggested and potential nutritional and other therapies are proposed.","output":"Multiple roles of haem in cystathionine -synthase activity: implications for hemin and other therapies of acute hepatic porphyria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New computing technologies inspired by the brain promise fundamentally different ways to process information with extreme energy efficiency and the ability to handle the avalanche of unstructured and noisy data that we are generating at an ever-increasing rate.

Newly synthesized M was found in these complexes almost immediately after its synthesis, whereas the S protein started to appear in heterocomplexes after 10-20 min. This is consistent with the slow rate of folding of S and with the observation that folding of S preceeds its association with M. While the folding of S involves the formation of multiple disulfide bonds, folding of M is disulfide-independent. This contrast was reflected by the differential sensitivity of the two proteins to reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT). Addition of DTT to the culture medium of MHV-infected cells drastically impaired the folding of S, but not of M. Consequently, the S protein was unable to interact with M. Under these conditions, S stayed in the ER while M was transported efficiently beyond the site of budding to the Golgi complex.

Patients were stratified to high and moderate risks of unfavorable outcome, according to clinical and laboratory parameters. In the main group with high risk, preemptive anticoagulant therapy was offered depending on the weight in intermediate and therapeutic dosages, in the control group C in preventive doses. In moderate risk of adverse outcome, prophylactic doses of anticoagulants were used in both groups. Control of outcomes was conducted in 1 month of observation. Results. The division of patients into subgroups and allocation of cohorts with high risk of adverse outcome lets to change the tactics of anticoagulant therapy timely, using therapeutic doses of drugs, if necessary, which reduces the frequency of thrombosis and mortality in the absence of a significant difference in the frequency of bleeding. Conclusions. The administration of intermediate and therapeutic doses of anticoagulants in the main group with high risk of unfavorable prognosis, taking into account the patients weight, led to decrease of the frequency of thrombosis from 40.9% in the control group to 14.6% in the main group (p=0.0001), and mortality C from 40.4% to 20.2% (p=0.0001).

Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy. METHODS: In a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortium's AbC-19(TM) Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices. FINDINGS: We observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19(TM) device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95% uncertainty interval 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (spectrum effects), but the extent of this varied by device. INTERPRETATION: The estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody.

A total of 110 SPA laparoscopy patients (cases) were matched with a cohort of 107 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy (controls) for benign adnexal lesions. SPA system consisted of a wound retractor, surgical glove, two 5-mm trocars, and one 11-mm trocar. Postoperative pain scores were measured immediately after surgery and at 6, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery using the numerical rating scale. RESULTS Postoperative pain scores did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .552). However, higher number of painkiller administrations was observed in the SPA laparoscopy group (median 3 vs 1, P < .001). The type of surgery and intraoperative blood loss were the significant factors influencing the number of painkiller administrations after controlling for other parameters by linear regression (P < .0001). The SPA laparoscopy group had less intraoperative blood loss (45.3 vs 87.5 mL, P < .001) and shorter hospital stay (2.1  0.8 vs 2.7  1.0 days, P < .001) compared with the conventional laparoscopy group.

Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation.

The treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients without rationing may improve the outcome. We therefore analyzed ICU resources allocated to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure and their outcomes. Methods: Retrospectively, we enrolled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients with respiratory failure from 03/08/2020 to 04/08/2020 and followed until 05/28/2020 in the university hospital of Freiburg, Germany. Results: In the defined interval, 34 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU with median age of 6713 (31-86) years. Six of 34 (17.6%) were female. All patients suffered from moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 91.2% of the patients were intubated and 23.5% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Proning was performed in 67.6%, renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 35.3%. Ninety-six percent required more than 20 nursing hours per day. Mean ICU stay was 2119 (1-81) days.

This experiment was conducted to observe the effects of composting on euthanized horse carcass degradation and sodium pentobarbital residues in compost material up to 367 d. Six separate compost bins were constructed on pastureland. Three bins served as the control while 3 served as the treatment. The carbonaceous material, or bulking agent, consisted of hardwood chips mixed with yard waste wetted to approximately 50% moisture content. Bulking agent was added to each bin at a depth of 0.46 m, creating the pad. A licensed veterinarian provided 6 horse carcasses for use in the experiment. These horses had required euthanasia for health reasons. All horses were weighed and then sedated with an intravenous injection of 8 mL of xylazine. After sedation the 3 horses in the treatment group were euthanized by intravenous injection of 60 mL of sodium pentobarbital. The 3 control group horses were anesthetized by intravenous injection of 15 mL of ketamine hydrochloride and then humanely euthanized by precise gunshot to the temporal lobe. Following euthanasia, each carcass was placed on the center of the pad and surrounded with 0.6 m of additional bulking agent. Serum and liver samples were obtained immediately following death. Compost samples were obtained on d 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, 129, 233, and 367 while soil samples were obtained on d -1 and 367. Each sample was analyzed for sodium pentobarbital concentration. Compost pile and ambient temperatures were also recorded. Composting successfully degraded soft tissue with only large bones remaining. Data illustrate that sodium pentobarbital was detectable up to 367 d in compost piles with no clear trend of concentration reduction. Drug residues were detected in soil samples indicating that sodium pentobarbital leached from the carcass and through the pad. These findings confirm the persistence of sodium pentobarbital from equine mortality compost piles and emphasize the importance of proper carcass management of animals euthanized with a barbiturate to reduce environmental impact and secondary toxicosis.","output":"Quantification of sodium pentobarbital residues from equine mortality compost piles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Ethical and professional duties compelled surgeons to act outside their specialties during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Uncontrolled inflammatory host responses contribute to the unfavorable outcome by driving lung and extrapulmonary organ failure. The complement fragment C5a holds significant proinflammatory functions and is associated with tissue damage in various inflammatory conditions. The authors hypothesized that C5a concentrations are increased in pneumonia and C5a neutralization promotes barrier stabilization in the lung and is protective in pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis. METHODS The authors investigated regulation of C5a in pneumonia in a prospective patient cohort and in experimental pneumonia. Two complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia were applied. Female mice were treated with NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA-aptamer. Lung, liver, and kidney injury and the inflammatory response were assessed by measuring pulmonary permeability (primary outcome), pulmonary and blood leukocytes, cytokine concentrations in lung and blood, and bacterial load in lung, spleen, and blood, and performing histologic analyses of tissue damage, apoptosis, and fibrin deposition (n = 5 to 13). RESULTS In hospitalized patients with pneumonia (n = 395), higher serum C5a concentrations were observed compared to healthy subjects (n = 24; 6.3 nmol/l [3.9 to 10.0] vs. 4.5 nmol/l [3.8 to 6.6], median [25 to 75% interquartile range]; difference: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.9]; P = 0.029). Neutralization of C5a in mice resulted in lower pulmonary permeability in pneumococcal pneumonia (1.38  0.89 vs. 3.29  2.34, mean  SD; difference: 1.90 [95% CI, 0.15 to 3.66]; P = 0.035; n = 10 or 11) or combined severe pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (2.56  1.17 vs. 7.31  5.22; difference: 4.76 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.30]; P = 0.011; n = 9 or 10). Further, C5a neutralization led to lower blood granulocyte colony-stimulating factor concentrations and protected against sepsis-associated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS Systemic C5a is elevated in pneumonia patients. Neutralizing C5a protected against lung and liver injury in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Early neutralization of C5a might be a promising adjunctive treatment strategy to improve outcome in community-acquired pneumonia. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Pneumonia, sepsis, and immune dysregulation cause morbidity and mortalityC5a is a component of the complement system and a proinflammatory mediator that modulates the innate immune response in critical illnessDisruption of the C5a receptor axis with antibodies or antagonists was previously protective in various animal sepsis models WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serum C5a concentrations were 1.4-fold higher compared to healthy subjectsIn two mouse models of pneumonia and sepsis, NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA aptamer, caused lower pulmonary hyperpermeability and sepsis-related acute liver injury.","output":"Neutralizing Complement C5a Protects Mice with Pneumococcal Pulmonary Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allele-specific PCR (ARMS) is one of the most commonly used methods for mutation detection. However, a main limitation of ARMS-PCR is the false positive results obtained due to non-specific priming that can take place with WT DNA, which often precludes detection of low-level mutations. To improve the analytical specificity of ARMS we present here a new technology, NAPA: NaME-PrO-assisted ARMS that overcomes the ARMS deficiency by adding a brief enzymatic step that reduces wild-type alleles just prior to ARMS. We performed this technology for the simultaneous detection of two hot-spot PIK3CA mutations (E545K and H1047R) in CTCs and cfDNA. The developed protocol could simultaneously detect mutation-allelic-frequency of 0.5% for PIK3CA exon 9 (E545K) and 0.1% for PIK3CA exon 20 (H1047R), with high specificity. We further compared the developed NAPA assay with a) ddPCR considered as the gold standard and b) our previous assay based on the combination of allele-specific, asymmetric rapid PCR and melting analysis. Our data show that the newly developed NAPA assay gives consistent results with both these assays (p=0.001). The developed assay resolves the false positive signals issue derived through classic ARMS-PCR and provides an ideal combination of speed, accuracy and versatility, and should be easily applicable in routine diagnostic labs.","output":"NaME-PrO-assisted ARMS (NAPA): a novel approach for the improvement of ARMS-PCR specificity in liquid biopsies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It has recently been argued that asthma does not increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated. RESULTS: Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, some studies have shown that the immunological memory only lasts three months. Thus, it is imperative to develop pharmacological treatments to cope with COVID-19. Here, the in silico approach by molecular docking, dynamic simulations and quantum biochemistry revealed that ACE2-derived peptides strongly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain of spike glycoprotein (S-RBD). ACE2-Dev-PepI, ACE2-Dev-PepII, ACE2-Dev-PepIII and ACE2-Dev-PepIV complexed with S-RBD provoked alterations in the 3D structure of S-RBD, leading to disruption of the correct interaction with the ACE2 receptor, a pivotal step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This wrong interaction between S-RBD and ACE2 could inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in cells, and thus virus replication and the establishment of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, we suggest that ACE2-derived peptides can interfere with recognition of ACE2 in human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Bioinformatic prediction showed that these peptides have no toxicity or allergenic potential.

This article explores this paradox by examining supply chain concentration in China as a form of asymmetric interdependence and the countermeasures from the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India to minimize vulnerabilities. It argues that while the COVID-19 disruptions have brought to light the risk of supply chain overconcentration in China, countermeasures are also driven by coercive diplomacy and the deepening U.S.-China rivalry.

This open-label trial was designed to collect preliminary data regarding the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of deep propofol anesthesia for treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants with moderate-to-severe medication-resistant depression (age 18-45 years and otherwise healthy) each received a series of 10 propofol infusions. Propofol was dosed to strongly suppress electroencephalographic activity for 15 minutes. The primary depression outcome was the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Self-rated depression scores were compared with a group of 20 patients who received electroconvulsive therapy. Results Propofol treatments were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse events occurred. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores remained stable. Hamilton scores decreased by a mean of 20 points (range 0-45 points), corresponding to a mean 58% improvement from baseline (range 0-100%). Six of the 10 subjects met the criteria for response (>50% improvement). Self-rated depression improved similarly in the propofol group and electroconvulsive therapy group. Five of the 6 propofol responders remained well for at least 3 months. In posthoc analyses, electroencephalographic measures predicted clinical response to propofol. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that high-dose propofol treatment is feasible and well tolerated by individuals with treatment-resistant depression who are otherwise healthy. Propofol may trigger rapid, durable antidepressant effects similar to electroconvulsive therapy but with fewer side effects. Controlled studies are warranted to further evaluate propofol's antidepressant efficacy and mechanisms of action.

Preintervention cerebrovascular blood volume (CBV) has been shown to predict outcomes in patients undergoing intra-arterial stroke therapies. OBJECTIVE To determine whether CBV can predict hemorrhagic transformation and clinical outcomes in patients selected for endovascular therapy for acute ischemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke using a CT perfusion (CTP)-based imaging protocol. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed cases of acute ischemic stroke due to MCA M1 segment occlusion and correlated favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale (mRS) 2) and radiographic outcomes with preintervention CBV values. All patients underwent whole-brain (320-detector-row) CTP imaging, and absolute CBV values of the affected and contralateral MCA territories were obtained separately for the cortical and basal ganglia regions. RESULTS Relative CBV (rCBV) of the MCA cortical regions was significantly lower in patients with poor clinical outcomes than in those with favorable clinical outcomes (0.870.21 vs 1.020.09, p=0.0003), and a negative correlation was found between rCBV values and mRS score severity. rCBV of the basal ganglia region was significantly lower in patients with hemorrhagic infarction (p=0.004) and parenchymal hematoma (p=0.04) than in those without hemorrhagic transformation. CONCLUSIONS We found that cortical CBV loss is predictive of poor clinical outcomes, whereas basal ganglia CBV loss is predictive of hemorrhagic transformation but without translation into poor clinical outcomes. Our study findings support published results of baseline preintervention CBV as a predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing intra-arterial stroke therapies.","output":"Correlation between cerebral blood volume values and outcomes in endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While many tests and indices are available to identify glaucoma progression, using them in combinations may decrease overall specificity. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing glaucoma progression using structural and functional indices jointly for a fixed specificity. METHODS: The study included 337 eyes of 207 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All patients had at least 9 visits. Each visit had retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and mean sensitivity from static automated perimetry (SAP MS) measured within a one-month window. Simple linear regression was applied to assess deterioration in each index for series of 5 to 9 visits. To identify progression using the two indices jointly, marginal significance levels set at a specificity of 95% were derived for two criteria: ANY (worsening on either RNFLT or SAP MS) and ALL (worsening on both RNFLT and SAP MS). Positive rate (percentage of eyes flagged as progressing) was determined individually for each index, as well as for the ANY and ALL criteria. RESULTS: Compared to SAP MS, RNFLT had higher positive rates (15% to 45%) for all series lengths. For the joint analyses, the positive rate was on average 12% higher for the ANY criterion compared to the ALL criterion. While RNFLT-alone had comparable positive rates and time-to-detection as the ANY criterion, each uniquely identified a subset of eyes (Kappa = 0.55 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a simple framework for assessing glaucoma progression with data from two tests jointly, without compromising specificity. This framework can be extended to include two or more parameters, can accommodate global or regional indices, and can eventually be used with novel parameters identified as predictive of glaucoma progression.","output":"A framework for assessing glaucoma progression using structural and functional indices jointly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Institutions, universities, and schools suspended teaching due to the novel coronavirus called (COVID-19) Covid19 induced educational authorities in Kuwait to find such alternatives to keep the process of teaching and learning going on They resorted to the use of E-learning by utilizing social media to finalize academic year Nowadays, E-learning is heavily used in the education field due to the Covid19 pandemic Kuwait International Law School (KILAW) implemented E-learning to sustain the process of teaching and learning This research was an attempt to scrutinize the utilization of social media by KILAW students The study was quantitative in nature The researcher conducted an online questionnaire for 116 students enrolled in the English department atrial The responses of the questionnaire were analyzed by using SPSS The finding showed that KILAW students use of SM for learning the English language is increased dramatically due to Covid19 The participants showed a positive attitude towards the use of SM The future of using SM in the field of education, in general, and in English language learning in particular, is promising in Kuwait This study recommended universities, schools and institutes to employ SM tools to augment the process of teaching and learning ? 2020, English Language Education Journals All rights reserved","output":"Social media and english language learning during Covid-19: KILAW students use, attitude, and prospective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a major impact on frontline health care workers Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced hospitals to conserve and reuse some of their PPE The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to health care workers is unclear There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure among health care workers Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 in frontline healthcare workers at University Medical Center (UMC) and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 764 asymptomatic healthcare workers at University Medical Center and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, after informed consents were signed IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARSCoV- 2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0 8% Six of the 764 participants tested positive Three of the six participants with positive results had prior COVID-19 diagnosis with mild symptoms managed at home The other three had asymptomatic infection CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent Possible explanations for this include adequate PPE measures, low COVID-19 infection in Lubbock, Texas, inadequate time for IgG response, and possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract defense system without eliciting a systemic immunologic response","output":"Prevalence of coronavirus antibody among 764 frontline healthcare workers at an academic hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular analysis of exhaled breath aerosol (EBA) with simple procedures represents a key step in clinical and point-of-care applications.

Therefore, direct sampling and analysis of trace constituents in EBA using a face mask can rapidly provide useful insights into human physiologic and pathological information. Herein, we introduce a simple approach to collect and analyze human EBA by combining a face mask with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. SPME fiber was inserted into a face mask to form SPME-in-mask that covered nose and mouth for in vivo sampling of EBA, and SPME fiber was then coupled with direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) to directly analyze the molecular compositions of EBA under ambient conditions. The applicability of SPME-in-mask was demonstrated by direct analysis of drugs and metabolites in oral and nasal EBA. The unique features of SPME-in-mask were also discussed. Our results showed that this method is enabled to analyze volatile and nonvolatile analytes in EBA and is expected to have a significant impact on human EBA analysis in clinical applications.

The aim of our study was to investigate the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein IgG (anti-S1 IgG) antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in an Italian cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs), following the Pfizer/BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, over a period of up to six months after the second dose. METHODS We enrolled 57 HCWs, without clinical history of COVID-19 infection. Fluoroenzyme-immunoassay was used for the quantitative anti-S1 IgG antibodies at different time points T1 (one month), T3 (three months) and T6 (six months) following the second vaccine shot. Simultaneously, a commercial surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) was used for the determination of NAbs, expressed as inhibition percentage (% IH). RESULTS Median values of anti-S1 IgG antibodies decreased from T1 (1,452 BAU/mL) to T6 (104 BAU/mL) with a percent variation of 92.8% while the sVNT showed a percent variation of 34.3% for the same time frame. The decline in anti-S1 IgG antibodies from T1 to T6 was not accompanied by a loss of the neutralizing capacity of antibodies. In fact at T6 a neutralization percentage <20% IH was observed only in 3.51% of HCWs.

This study evaluated the pattern of OAT uptake among PWID in two consecutive national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (2010 and 2014) in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from two national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (N2010 = 1783 and N2014 = 2166) implemented using convenience sampling at the harm reduction facilities and street venues in 10 geographically diverse urban centers across Iran. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine the correlates of OAT uptake for the 2014 survey, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. RESULTS: The prevalence of OAT uptake decreased from 49.2% in 2010 to 45.8% in 2014 (P value = 0.033). OAT uptake varied across the studied cities ranging from 0.0 to 69.3% in the 2010 survey and 3.2 to 75.5% in the 2014 survey. Ever being married (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.12, 1.75), having a history of incarceration (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.16, 2.09), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sero-positivity (AOR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.08, 2.50) were associated with OAT uptake. Conversely, PWID who reported using only non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.26, 0.71) and those who reported concurrent use of opioid and non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.51, 0.86) were less likely to uptake OAT. CONCLUSIONS: Although OAT uptake among PWID in Iran is above the 40% threshold defined by the World Health Organization, there remain significant disparities across urban settings in Iran. Importantly, the OAT services appear to be serving high-risk PWID including those living with HIV and those with a history of incarceration. Evaluating service integration including mental health, HIV and hepatitis C virus care, and other harm reduction services may support the optimization of health outcomes associated with OAT across Iran.","output":"Opioid agonist therapy uptake among people who inject drugs: the findings of two consecutive bio-behavioral surveillance surveys in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced the hardest-hit populations, like Italians, to radically change their daily habits, starting with social distancing, strict preventive measures, and self-isolation.

The aim of the current review is to give an update on the current status and future recommendations for VAP prevention. METHODS This article gives an updated review of the current literature on VAP. The first part briefly reviews pathogenesis and epidemiology while the second includes an in-depth review of evidence-based practice guidelines (EBPG) and new technologies developed for prevention of VAP. RESULTS VAP remains a frequent and costly complication of critical illness with a pooled relative risk of 9-27% and mortality of 25-50%. Strikingly, VAP adds an estimated cost of more than $40,000 to a typical hospital admission. An important aetiological mechanism of VAP is gross or micro-aspiration of oropharyngeal organisms around the cuff of the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the distal bronchi. Prevention of VAP is preferable. Preventative measures can be divided into two main groups: the implemen- tation of EBPGs and use of device-based technologies. EBPGs have been authored jointly by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The Canadian Critical Care Trials group also published VAP Guidelines in 2008. Their recommendations are detailed in this review. The current device-based technologies include drainage of subglottic secretions, silver coated ETTs aiming to influence the internal bio-layer of the ETT, better sealing of the lower airways with ultrathin cuffs and loops for optimal cuff pressure control. CONCLUSIONS EBPG consensus includes: elevation of the head of the bed, use of daily \\"sedation vacations\\" and decontamination of the oropharynx. Technological solutions should aim to use the most comprehensive combination of subglottic suction of secretions, optimization of ETT cuff pressure and ultrathin cuffs. VAP is a type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that develops more than 48 h after endotracheal intubation. Its incidence is estimated to be 9-27%, with a mortality of 25-50% [Am J Respir Crit Care Med 171:388-416 (2005), Am J Med 85:499-506 (1988), Chest 122:2115-2121 (2002), Intensive Care Med 35:9-29 (2009)].

To identify potential therapeutic targets, we focussed on previously described four recovery clusters five months after hospital discharge, their underlying inflammatory profiles and relationship with clinical outcomes at one year. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a prospective longitudinal cohort study, recruiting adults hospitalised with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs), physical performance, and organ function at five-months and one-year after hospital discharge. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed. Findings 2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35.6% were female, mean age 58.7 (SD 12.5) years, and 27.8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/165 (25.6%) and one year 232/804 (28.9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.99), obesity OR 0.50 (95%CI 0.34-0.74) and IMV OR 0.42 (95%CI 0.23-0.76). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate/cognitive, mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0.88 (0.74-1.00), five months 0.74 (0.60-0.88) to one year: 0.74 (0.59-0.88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. Interpretation The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 remain substantial one year after discharge across a range of health domains with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient perceived health-related quality of life remains reduced at one year compared to pre-hospital admission.

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena.

At the onset of the pandemic, NHS maternity services were stripped of many of the features which support woman and family centred care. In anticipation of unknown numbers of pregnant women and maternity staff potentially sick with COVID-19, services were pared back to the minimum level considered to be required to keep women and their babies safe. The aim of this survey was to understand the impact of COVID-19 public health messaging and pandemic-related service changes on users of maternity care in the UK during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey to explore user's experiences of COVID-19 public health messaging and 'socially-distanced' maternity care across the UK. The study population consisted of women who had experienced pregnancy after the 11th March 2020 (when the WHO declared a pandemic), whether or not they were still pregnant. We collected data between June and September 2020. We used framework analysis for the free-text data and generated descriptive statistics. FINDINGS: Women were generally happy to adopt a precautionary approach and stringently social distance in the context of a relatively unknown pathogen and in an environment of extreme anxiety and uncertainty, but were acutely aware of the negative impacts. The survey found that the widespread changes to services caused unintended negative consequences including essential clinical care being missed, confusion over advice, and distress and emotional trauma for women. COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in women feeling their antenatal and postnatal care to be inadequate and has also come at great emotional cost to users. Women reported feeling isolated and sad in the postnatal period, but also frustrated and upset by a lack of staff to help them care for their new baby. KEY CONCLUSIONS: With growing evidence of the impact of the virus on pregnant women and an increased understanding of the unintended consequences of unclear public health messaging and overly precautious services, a more nuanced, evidence-based approach to caring for women during a pandemic must be prioritised. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: All maternity services should ensure they have clear lines of communication with women to keep them updated on changing care and visiting arrangements. Services should ensure that opportunities to provide safe face-to-face care and access for birth partners and visitors are maximised.","output":"\\"Anxious and traumatised\\": Users' experiences of maternity care in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization, demographic change, sustainable development, and implications of the Corona virus challenge German hospitals today.

Quality Improvement Organization (QIN-QIOs) contractors. TR involves focused onsite and/or virtual one-on-one technical assistance to nursing homes. For COVID-19 TR, the most common QIN-QIO-reported activities include: assistance with developing and implementing policies and improved processes for hand hygiene, ensuring availability and proper use of personal protective equipment, and general infection control. CMS? criteria to refer NHs for QIN-QIO assistance varied over the entire study period as the program evolved. At various times, these criteria included: infection control-related health inspection deficiencies, NHs located in counties designated as geographic hot spots, having 30 or more new COVID-19 cases in the past week. NH participation in TR is voluntary and free-of-charge. The objective of this study was to assess TR impact on COVID-19 incidence in NHs. Study Design We used a quasi-experimental observational design. NHs may have started receiving TR any time between April 24, and October 28, 2020. COVID-19 incidence data were obtained for May 31 through November 29, 2020 from the National Healthcare Safety Network. Each program NH was matched at the time of first QIN-QIO interaction with a similar non-TR NH. Matching characteristics were: overall NH star rating, health inspections star rating, bed size, state, area deprivation index, and county-level COVID incidence in the month of and the month prior to first receipt of TR. We used longitudinal regression models in the period following first QIN-QIO interaction to compare COVID-19 incidence between NHs that received TR to matched controls that did not. Generalized estimating equations with a Poisson distribution and log-link were used to model COVID-19 incidence, TR status and a full set of covariates. Population Studied CMS-certified NHs providing short-stay, long-stay, or both types of care. Principal Findings Among the 2474 NHs that received TR in the study period, 2013 were matched to 2013 similar NHs that did not. Depending on the month, COVID-19 incidence after matching was similar or higher in the TR group at baseline, but all other covariates were balanced. In this preliminary analysis, NHs receiving TR had 27.7% (p-value <0.0001, 95% CI: 17.2%?36.9%) lowered COVID-19 incidence compared to similar NHs that did not receive TR. Effect estimates withstood early sensitivity analyses. Conclusions The TR intervention was associated with a decline in COVID-19 incidence in TR NHs relative to non-TR NHs. Future analyses will explore which aspects of TR and QIN-QIOs may have been most effective and the attributes of nursing homes that demonstrated improvement. Implications for Policy or Practice Deploying TR for quality improvement in NHs in real-time demonstrated a relative improvement in infection control. CMS should consider expanding TR to a broader range of outcomes. In addition, we must continue to conduct real-time evaluation of the QIN-QIO program as the tools and technologies evolve to prevent infections and other negative outcomes in facilities.

Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are urgently needed. Methods: In this study, 43 COVID-19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed. Results: A total of 43 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9+/-9.4 vs 44.4+/-15.9) and had higher incidence in co-infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%). Significantly more severe patients had the clinical symptoms of anhelation (78.6%) and asthma (71.4%). For laboratory examination, 57.1% severe cases showed significant reduction in lymphocyte count. The levels of Interluekin-6 (IL6), IL10, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-Dimer (D-D) were significantly higher in severe patients than mild patients, while the level of albumin (ALB) was remarkably lower in severe patients. Further analysis demonstrated that ESR, D-D, age, ALB and IL6 were the major contributing factors for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients. Moreover, ESR was identified as the most powerful factor to predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Age and the levels of ESR, D-D, ALB and IL6 are closely related to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. ESR can be used as a valuable indicator for distinguishing severe COVID-19 patients in early stage, so as to increase the survival of severe patients.

Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center. METHODS An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into \\"high risk,\\" \\"intermediate risk,\\" and \\"undetermined risk\\" for both isolation and testing. RESULTS A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died. About 1.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10.3% to the general ward, and 6.4% were isolated. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 (0.1%) and 127 (3.4%) tested positive for atypical infection; 1471 patients were tested for COVID-19; 583 were stratified as high-risk, 781 as intermediate-risk, and 107 as undetermined-risk patients. CONCLUSION Rapid response for infection control is a paramount in the ED to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. The FFS helped divide the flow of high- and intermediate-risk patients; it also decreased the ED workload during a surge of febrile patients. A graded approach to testing uses risk stratification to prevent nosocomial infection of asymptomatic patients. A graded approach to isolation enables efficient allocation of scarce medical resources according to risk stratification.","output":"Emergency department response to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak with a fever screening station and \\"graded approach\\" for isolation and testing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are constantly increasing in their indications for use as anti-cancer treatment in various neoplasms, the majority of which are linked with BRCA deficiency.

The growing global concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has encouraged research into the development of nutritional and feeding strategies as well as vaccination protocols in order to counteract the PWD due to ETEC. A valid approach to researching effective strategies is to implement piglet in vivo challenge models with ETEC infection. Thus, the proper application and standardization of ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models represent an urgent priority. The current review provides an overview regarding the current piglet ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models; it highlights the key points for setting the challenge protocols and the most important indicators which should be included in research studies to verify the effectiveness of the ETEC challenge. Based on the current review, it is recommended that the setting of the model correctly assesses the choice and preconditioning of pigs, and the timing and dosage of the ETEC inoculation. Furthermore, the evaluation of the ETEC challenge response should include both clinical parameters (such as the occurrence of diarrhea, rectal temperature and bacterial fecal shedding) and biomarkers for the specific expression of ETEC F4/F18 (such as antibody production, specific F4/F18 immunoglobulins (Igs), ETEC F4/F18 fecal enumeration and analysis of the F4/F18 receptors expression in the intestinal brush borders). On the basis of the review, the piglets response upon F4 or F18 inoculation differed in terms of the timing and intensity of the diarrhea development, on ETEC fecal shedding and in the piglets immunological antibody response.

Despite similar clinical goals, the outcomes and endpoints used in these trials are broad and not well standardized. OBJECTIVE To describe results from a systematic literature review focused on outcomes and endpoints used in preventive migraine clinical trials. METHOD A systematic literature review, following a pre-specified (unregistered) protocol developed to adhere to recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, was conducted to characterize the endpoints and outcomes used in preventive migraine clinical trials. Predetermined terms were searched in PubMed on October 28, 2019. Data related to trial design, subject characteristics, outcomes, and endpoints reported in each publication were extracted. Descriptive summaries of these features were tabulated for the recent subset of publications, published during or after 1988, that were randomized, blinded, and focused on pharmacological or device therapies for the preventive treatment of migraine. RESULTS The initial literature search identified 1506 publications, of which 757 publications were eligible for data extraction. Of specific clinical interest were the recent subset of 268 articles (268/757, 35.4%) fulfilling the targeted criteria. Results showed that the outcomes used to define endpoints varied substantially across publications. For example, in the recent subset of publications, 68.7% (184/268) of the publications examined 1 migraine-specific outcome, 39.6% (106/268) examined 1 headache-specific outcome, 50.7% (136/268) examined 1 acute/rescue medication use outcome, 40.3% (108/268) examined 1 headache-related patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), and 22.0% (59/268) examined 1 non-headache-specific PROM. Furthermore, the definition of the endpoints used (e.g., change from baseline, fixed timepoint comparisons, categorization of \\"responders\\" to treatment based on wide variety of \\"responder definitions\\") also differed across publications. CONCLUSION Publications from clinical trials of preventive migraine pharmacologic and device treatments differed in terms of study design, endpoint definitions, and how endpoints and outcomes were measured. Although there were common outcomes and endpoints used across publications, no clear \\"standardized\\" set of endpoints and outcomes emerged. The inconsistencies in endpoints and outcomes within this literature suggest that the development of a uniform set of outcomes and endpoints could improve the clinical meaningfulness of clinical trial results, facilitate cross-trial comparisons and better inform patient care. This standard set of outcomes and endpoints should be statistically robust and informed by the priorities of various stakeholders, most importantly, the needs and preferences of people living with migraine.","output":"Systematic review of outcomes and endpoints in preventive migraine clinical trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Small studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, affecting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This may be of great importance considering the large number of patients worldwide who are treated with RAS blockers, and the well-proven clinical benefit of these treatments in several cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, RAS blockers have also been associated with better outcomes in pneumonia models, and may be beneficial in COVID-19. This review sought to analyse the evidence regarding RAS blockers in the context of COVID-19 and to perform a pooled analysis of the published observational studies to guide clinical decision making. A total of 21 studies were included, comprising 11,539 patients, of whom 3417 (29.6%) were treated with RAS blockers. All-cause mortality occurred in 587/3417 (17.1%) patients with RAS blocker treatment and in 982/8122 (12.1%) patients without RAS blocker treatment (odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69C1.45; P = 0.49; I2 = 84%). As several hypotheses can be drawn from experimental analysis, we also present the ongoing randomized studies assessing the efficacy and safety of RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19.

STZ's known carcinogenic properties, however, raise concerns about its suitability for long-term studies. We conducted a formal study of STZ's carcinogenic effects in long-term surviving diabetic Wistar-Furth rats. To determine if insulin therapy or islet transplantation exacerbated tumorigenesis, rats were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups: normal animals with no treatment (Group 1, n=12); normal animals that underwent peritoneal implantation of porcine islets encapsulated in a double layer of agarose to form islet macrobeads (normal + islets; group 2, n=12); STZ treatment followed by daily exogenous insulin (STZ + insulin; group 3, n=18) and STZ treatment followed by the intraperitoneal implantation of porcine islet macrobeads (STZ + islets; group 4, n=14). At 215 days post-STZ induction, no renal proliferative lesions were observed in animals that did not receive STZ (group 1 and group 2) whereas adenoma incidences of 57% for group 3 and 34% for group 4 were observed. By terminal necropsy at day 351, the incidence and severity of renal proliferative lesions increased with tubular carcinoma observed in 67% of group 3 and 60% of group 4 animals. We conclude that the STZ-induced diabetic rat model is not suitable for long-term studies because of progressive renal tumorigenesis.

In the first stage, we apply an enhanced Louvain algorithm, called Ensemble Louvain, to find stable communities. In the second stage, we form influence links between these communities, and identify linked super-communities. For the detected communities, we compute internal and external influence, and for individual users, the retweet h-index influence. We apply the proposed approach to three years of Twitter data of all Slovenian tweets. The analysis shows that the Slovenian tweetosphere is dominated by politics, that the left-leaning communities are larger, but that the right-leaning communities and users exhibit significantly higher impact.

Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. Results: The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR = 1.647, CI95 = 1.647 - 2.530; Depression: AOR = 1.622, CI95 = 1.274 - 2.072).

METHODS: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic COVID-19 cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the pre-symptomatic stage. RESULTS: Routine bi-weekly NP testing, once every two weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD: 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD: 0.98) during the pre-symptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD: 0.18) and 32.9% (SD: 1.23), respectively.

Engaging citizens' in the COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens compliance to health emergency containment measures. Method: An online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out. Results: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. Conclusions: The Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.","output":"Measuring Italian Citizens' Engagement in the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic Containment Measures A Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiovascular toxicity is a leading cause of mortality among cancer survivors and has become increasingly prevalent due to improved cancer survival rates. In this review, we synthesize evidence illustrating how common cancer therapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines, human epidermal growth factors receptors (HER2) monoclonal antibodies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have been evaluated in cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity. We place this in the context of precision cardio-oncology, an emerging concept for personalizing the prevention and management of cardiovascular toxicities from cancer therapies, accounting for each individual patients unique factors. We outline steps that will need to be addressed by multidisciplinary teams of cardiologists and oncologists in partnership with regulators to implement future applications of hiPSCs in precision cardio-oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: Current prevention of cardiovascular toxicity involves routine screenings and management of modifiable risk factors for cancer patients, as well as the initiation of cardioprotective medications. Despite recent advancements in precision cardio-oncology, knowledge gaps remain and limit our ability to appropriately predict with precision which patients will develop cardiovascular toxicity. Investigations using patient-specific CMs facilitate pharmacological discovery, mechanistic toxicity studies, and the identification of cardioprotective pathways. Studies with hiPSCs demonstrate that patients with comorbidities have more frequent adverse responses, compared to their counterparts without cardiac disease. Further studies utilizing hiPSC modeling should be considered, to evaluate the impact and mitigation of known cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes, and physical activity in their role in cardiovascular toxicity after cancer therapy. Future real-world applications will depend on understanding the current use of hiPSC modeling in order for oncologists and cardiologists together to inform their potential to improve our clinical collaborative practice in cardio-oncology. SUMMARY: When applying such in vitro characterization, it is hypothesized that a safety score can be assigned to each individual to determine who has a greater probability of developing cardiovascular toxicity. Using hiPSCs to create personalized models and ultimately evaluate the cardiovascular toxicity of individuals treatments may one day lead to more patient-specific treatment plans in precision cardio-oncology while reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.","output":"Modeling Precision Cardio-Oncology: Using Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Risk Stratification and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The P? gene of the paramyxovirus SV5 encodes two known proteins, P (M(r)  44,000) and V (M(r)  24,000). The complete nucleotide sequence of the P? gene has been obtained and is found to contain two open reading frames, neither of which is large enough to encode the P protein. We have shown that the P and V proteins are translated from two mRNAs that differ by the presence of two nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA. These two additional nucleotides convert the two open reading frames to one of 392 amino acids. The P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have 164 amino acids in common. The unique C terminus of V consists of a cysteine-rich region that resembles a cysteine-rich metal binding domain. An open reading frame that contains this cysteine-rich region exists in all other paramyxovirus P? gene sequences examined, which suggests that it may have important biological significance.","output":"Two mRNAs that differ by two nontemplated nucleotides encode the amino coterminal proteins P and V of the paramyxovirus SV5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using serious games to communicate and teach complex topics to children and adolescence has gained a lot of popularity, especially in the medical fields.

The disease has been spreading very rapidly and few months after the identification of the first infected, shortage of hospital resources quickly became a problem. In this work we investigate whether artificial intelligence working with chest X-ray (CXR) scans and clinical data can be used as a possible tool for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome, like intensive care or death. Indeed, further to induce lower radiation dose than computed tomography (CT), CXR is a simpler and faster radiological technique, being also more widespread. In this respect, we present three approaches that use features extracted from CXR images, either handcrafted or automatically learnt by convolutional neuronal networks, which are then integrated with the clinical data. As a further contribution, this work introduces a repository that collects data from 820 patients enrolled in six Italian hospitals in spring 2020 during the first COVID-19 emergency. The dataset includes CXR images, several clinical attributes and clinical outcomes. Exhaustive evaluation shows promising performance both in 10-fold and leave-one-centre-out cross-validation, suggesting that clinical data and images have the potential to provide useful information for the management of patients and hospital resources.","output":"AIforCOVID: Predicting the clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 applying AI to chest-X-rays.

First objective of our study was to study the FPs' knowledge about COVID-19 and second objective was to assess their attitudes, stress and death anxiety surrounding the current pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was prepared to collect responses from FPs between March-April 2020. A descriptive and correlational design was utilized. RESULTS: 240 FPs from eight countries were evaluated. The majority reported that they receive most information from medical journals (77%). The majority of respondents also noted that the most common symptoms are acute respiratory syndrome and fever - with the most effective treatment in most cases consisting of symptomatic treatment (41%). Although FPs generally had a positive attitude, most of them (68%) were concerned about contracting COVID-19 from patients and as a result, they experienced increased stress (64%). CONCLUSION: The research was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak while the FPs were working on the frontline of the pandemic. This research revealed that most of the FPs have good knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards COVID-19 treatment. It was observed that participants who tended towards conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience, and who had higher life satisfaction, and lower levels of death anxiety also reported more positive attitudes towards COVID-19. While the main target population of COVID-19 disease are the older age groups, FPs' attitudes and fear levels were not associated with age, gender, or years of experience.","output":"Family Physicians' Knowledge about and Attitudes towards COVID-19 - A Cross-sectional Multicentric Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To study the contagiousness of sperm and its influence on fertility after recovery from COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT(S): One hundred twenty Belgian men who had recovered from proven COVID-19 infection. INTERVENTION(S): No intervention was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sermm quality was assessed using the World Health Organisation criteria. DNA damage to sperm cells was assessed by quantifying the DNA fragmentation index and the high density stainability. Finally antibodies against SARS-CoV2 spike-1 antigen, nuclear and S1-receptor binding domain were measured by Elisa and chemilumenscent microparticle immunoassays, repsectively. RESULT(S): SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in semen during the period shortly after infection nor at a later time. Mean progressive motility was reduced in 60% of men tested shortly (<1 month) after COVID-19 infection, 37% of men tested 1 to 2 months after COVID-19 infection, and 28% of men tested >2 months after COVID-19 infection. Mean sperm count was reduced in 37% of men tested shortly (<1 month) after COVID-19 infection, 29% of men tested 1 to 2 months after COVID-19 infection, and 6% of men tested >2 months after COVID-19 infection. The severity of COVID-19 infection and the presence of fever were not correlated with sperm characteristics, but there were strong correlations between sperm abnormalities and the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody against spike 1 and the receptor- binding domain of spike 1, but not against nucleotide, in serum. High levels of antisperm antibodies developed in three men (2.5%). CONCLUSION(S): Semen is not infectious with SARS-CoV-2 at 1 week or more after COVID-19 infection (mean, 53 days). However, couples with a desire for pregnancy should be warned that sperm quality after COVID-19 infection can be suboptimal. The estimated recovery time is 3 months, but further follow-up studies are under way to confirm this and to determine if permanent damage occurred in a minority of men.","output":"Sperm quality and absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen after COVID-19 infection: a prospective, observational study and validation of the SpermCOVID test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study demonstrates the feasibility and inherent benefits of combining two distinct asymmetric transition metal-catalyzed reactions in one-pot.

A set of regions can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each region far exceeds that between them. COVID-19 can be eliminated if the region-to-region reproductive number---i.e. the average number of other regions to which a single infected region will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that this region-to-region reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the future) impose social distancing measures shortly after active spreading begins within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time. Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions.","output":"Eliminating COVID-19: The Impact of Travel and Timing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper comprises two cases illustrating ethical challenges experienced by people working with residents and staff in congregate settings (residential homes) during Covid-19.

In addition, host genetic makeup is also known to play a major role in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To assess the genetic predisposition of the Indian population to COVID-19, a comparative analysis of the frequencies of polymorphisms directly or potentially associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, immune response, and fatal outcomes was done between the Indian population and other major populations (European, African, East Asian, South Asian, and American). Materials and methods Polymorphisms directly or potentially associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, immune response, and mortality were mined from genetic association studies, comparative genetic studies, expression quantitative trait loci studies among others. Genotype data of these polymorphisms were either sourced from the GenomegaDB database of Mapmygenome India Ltd. (sample size = 3054; Indian origin) or were imputed. Polymorphisms with minor allele frequency >= 0.05 and that are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the Indian population were considered for allele frequency comparison between the Indian population and 1000 Genome population groups. Results Allele frequencies of 421 polymorphisms were found to be significantly different in the Indian population compared to European, African, East Asian, South Asian, and American populations. 128 polymorphisms were shortlisted based on linkage disequilibrium and were analyzed in detail. Apart from well-studied genes, like ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and FURIN, variants from AHSG, IFITM3, PTPN2, CD209, CCL5, HEATR9, SELENBP9, AGO1, HLA-G, MX1, ICAM3, MUC5B, CRP, C1GALT1, and other genes were also found to be significantly different in Indian population. These variants might be implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility and progression. Conclusion Our comparative study unraveled multiple genetic variants whose allele frequencies were significantly different in the Indian population and might have a potential role in COVID-19 susceptibility, its severity, and fatal outcomes.

Yet to our knowledge, no study has compared the antibacterial efficacy of a large collection of hand sanitizers. Using zone of growth inhibition and kill curve assays, we assessed the performance of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers that were obtained from national chain big-box stores, gasoline stations, pharmacies, and boutiques for antibacterial activity toward prototypical Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial pathogens. Results revealed substantial variability in the efficacy of many sanitizers evaluated. Formulations following World Health Organization-recommended ingredients (80% ethanol or 75% isopropyl alcohol) or those including benzalkonium chloride as the active principal ingredient displayed excellent antibacterial activity, whereas others exhibited modest or poor activity in the assays performed. Results also revealed that E. coli was generally more susceptible to most sanitizers in comparison to S. aureus and that there was significant strain-to-strain variability in hand sanitizer antimicrobial efficacy regardless of the organism evaluated. Further, tests of a subset of hand sanitizers toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial and antiviral performance, with all ethyl alcohol formulations performing equally well and displaying improved activity in comparison to benzalkonium chloride-containing sanitizer.

PURPOSE Visual performance has gradually gained recognition in baseball as a tool that can optimize on-field performance. It also may be useful in player development programs that gradually move players toward the major league. METHODS Recently, over the past 5 years, vision data from six different major league teams were used by the authors to assess prospective players before the annual Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. One thousand three hundred forty-three vision forms were evaluated representing 759 different players. Their vision data were retrospectively analyzed using a novel grading method to advise teams on the visual readiness of prospects for success in MLB. RESULTS On a one (best)-to-six (worst) vision scale, the average vision score was 2.080  1.171. Sixty-eight percent (320/473) of the players with good vision scores were drafted, 66% (185/281) of the players with moderate vision scores were drafted, and only 1 player with a poor vision score was drafted. There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of signing bonus received by draftees with better vision scores compared with those with lower vision scores (P < .003 to P < .001). Draftees with the highest vision scores also received the highest signing bonuses as they entered MLB.

PURPOSE: We evaluated a previously published risk model (Novant model) to identify patients at risk for healthcare facilityConset Clostridioides difficile infection (HCFO-CDI) at 2 hospitals within a large health system and compared its predictive value to that of a new model developed based on local findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study including adult patients admitted from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2018. Patients with HCFO-CDI who received systemic antibiotics were included as cases and were matched 1 to 1 with controls (who received systemic antibiotics without developing HCFO-CDI). We extracted chart data on patient risk factors for CDI, including those identified in prior studies and those included in the Novant model. We applied the Novant model to our patient population to assess the models utility and generated a local model using logistic regressionCbased prediction scores. A receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) score was determined for each model. RESULTS: We included 362 patients, with 161 controls and 161 cases. The Novant model had a ROC-AUC of 0.62 in our population. Our local model using risk factors identifiable at hospital admission included hospitalization within 90 days of admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-6.04), hematologic malignancy (adjusted OR, 12.87; 95% CI, 3.70-44.80), and solid tumor malignancy (adjusted OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.27-17.80) as HCFO-CDI predictors and had a ROC-AUC score of 0.74.

The theoretical calculations of the mentioned compound have been carried out using the more popular density functional theory method, Becke-3-Parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) in 6-31G+(d,p) basis set. The computational results of the compound were compared with the obtained experimental value. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, molecular electrostatic potential, chemical reactivity parameters and natural bond orbital of the optimized structure have been evaluated at the same level of theory. Furthermore, the UVCVis spectrum of the compound has been carried out for the better understanding of electronic absorption spectra with the help of the time-dependent density functional theory at room temperature. Besides, the molecular docking simulation of the mentioned molecule with target protein was also investigated. In addition, in silico studies were performed to predict absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity profiles of the designed compound. The results indicated that the theoretical data have well correlated with the observed values. The narrow frontier orbital gap indicated that the eventual charge transfer interaction occurs within the studied molecule and showed high chemical reactivity. The global reactivity values showed that the compound is soft molecule, electrophilic species and has strong binding ability with biomolecules. The molecular electrostatic potential structure indicated that the negative and positive potential sites are around electronegative atoms and hydrogen atoms of studied compound, respectively. The natural bond orbital data revealed that the compound contains 97.42% Lewis and 2.58% non-Lewis structure. The intra and inter-molecular charge transfers process occur within the studied compound. The studied compound showed more binding energy (?6.0 kcal/mol) with target protein than hydroxychloroquine (?5.6 kcal/mol). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity investigation predicted that the compound has good drug like character.","output":"DFT studies on vibrational and electronic spectra, HOMOCLUMO, MEP, HOMA, NBO and molecular docking analysis of benzyl-3-N-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylmethylene)hydrazinecarbodithioate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extraordinary circumstances of deaths during COVID-19 pandemic have been challenging for the deceased's families.

Electronic microscopy, energy-dispersive, and Raman spectra were used to confirm that E. flavus 21C3 effectively converts thiosulfate to ZVS. We next used a combined proteomic and genetic method to identify thiosulfate dehydrogenase (TsdA) and thiosulfohydrolase (SoxB) playing key roles in the conversion of thiosulfate to ZVS. Stoichiometric results of different sulfur intermediates further clarify the function of TsdA in converting thiosulfate to tetrathionate ((?)O(3)SCSCSCSO(3)(?)), SoxB in liberating sulfone from tetrathionate to form ZVS and sulfur dioxygenases (SdoA/SdoB) in oxidizing ZVS to sulfite under some conditions.

Systematic research on sensitivity of rates to the choice of the study parameters is lacking. This study investigates the influence of study parameter choices on background rates of adverse events. Methods We used 12 electronic health record and administrative claims data sources to calculate incidence rates of 15 adverse events. We examined the influence of age, race, sex, database, time-at-risk start event and duration, season and year, prior observation and clean window. For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect model meta-analysis. Results We observed a wide variation of background rates. The population characteristics had the largest impact with rates varying up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups. Even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Anchoring on any type of healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence when compared to anchoring on a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. The rates were highly variable across databases. Conclusion Background rates were highly sensitive to demographic characteristics of population, so comparing background to observed rates requires age, sex and race adjustment, and even with these adjustments, variability remains high among databases. Incidence rates were highly influenced by the choice of the time-at-risk start and duration and less influenced by secular or seasonal trends.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionnaires. SETTINGS: A multisite healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6062) employed in a multisite healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. MAIN OUTCOMES: Using Bayesian and multivariate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody levels, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential COVID-19 illness-related exposures; and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom (OR 11.04, p<0.001) in addition to fever (OR 2.02, p=0.002) and myalgias (OR 1.65, p=0.035). After adjusting for potential confounders, seroprevalence was also associated with Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.98, p=0.001) and African-American race (OR 2.02, p=0.027) as well as contact with a COVID-19-diagnosed individual in the household (OR 5.73, p<0.001) or clinical work setting (OR 1.76, p=0.002).

Repetitiveness and clustering of contacts are known to be relevant factors influencing the transmission of droplet or contact transmitted diseases. However, we do not yet completely know under what conditions repetitiveness and clustering should be included for realistically modelling disease spread. METHODS: We compare two different types of individual-based models: One assumes random mixing without repetition of contacts, whereas the other assumes that the same contacts repeat day-by-day. The latter exists in two variants, with and without clustering. We systematically test and compare how the total size of an outbreak differs between these model types depending on the key parameters transmission probability, number of contacts per day, duration of the infectious period, different levels of clustering and varying proportions of repetitive contacts. RESULTS: The simulation runs under different parameter constellations provide the following results: The difference between both model types is highest for low numbers of contacts per day and low transmission probabilities. The number of contacts and the transmission probability have a higher influence on this difference than the duration of the infectious period. Even when only minor parts of the daily contacts are repetitive and clustered can there be relevant differences compared to a purely random mixing model. CONCLUSION: We show that random mixing models provide acceptable estimates of the total outbreak size if the number of contacts per day is high or if the per-contact transmission probability is high, as seen in typical childhood diseases such as measles. In the case of very short infectious periods, for instance, as in Norovirus, models assuming repeating contacts will also behave similarly as random mixing models. If the number of daily contacts or the transmission probability is low, as assumed for MRSA or Ebola, particular consideration should be given to the actual structure of potentially contagious contacts when designing the model.","output":"Models of epidemics: when contact repetition and clustering should be included"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examines the trajectories of unhealthy food and alcohol consumption over time and considers whether perceived impact of COVID-19 and psychological variables are predictors of these trajectories.

Understanding the molecular details of this process is essential for antiviral strategies. Recent structural studies revealed a stunning diversity of viral fusion proteins in their native state. In spite of this diversity, the post-fusion structures of these proteins share a common trimeric hairpin motif in which the amino- and carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domains are positioned at the same end of a rod-shaped molecule. The converging hairpin motif, along with biochemical and functional data, implies that disparate viral proteins promote membrane merger via a universal \\"cast-and-fold\\" mechanism. According to this model, fusion proteins first anchor themselves to the target membrane through their hydrophobic segments and then fold back, bringing the viral and cellular membranes together and forcing their merger. However, the pathways of protein refolding and the mechanism by which this refolding is coupled to membrane rearrangements are still not understood. The availability of specific inhibitors targeting distinct steps of HIV-1 entry permitted the identification of key conformational states of its envelope glycoprotein en route to fusion.

METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study in IBD patients in clinical and biochemical remission on IFX or ADA maintenance therapy. Trough serum concentrations and antidrug antibodies were measured in addition to biochemical markers of inflammation in serum and stool to confirm quiescent disease. QoL was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and 36-item short form]. Side effects such as fatigue and arthralgia were measured with a visual analogue score [VAS]. Skin toxicity was reported with a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-derived score. RESULTS In all, 252 IBD patients on maintenance anti-TNF therapy were screened, of whom 95 [73 with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative colitis; 72 on IFX, 23 on ADA] were in clinical and biochemical remission and were included. Median TLs were 5.5 g/ml and 6.6 g/ml for IFX and ADA, respectively. Patients with anti-TNF TLs above median had lower IBDQ scores than patients with lower TLs [IBDQ 176 vs 187, p = 0.02], particularly regarding systemic symptoms and emotional status. A trend towards lower SF-36 and higher fatigue scores was observed in the higher anti-TNF TL group. Skin and arthralgia scores were not significantly different between the groups.

METHODS: Thirty-seven CSAP patients and sixty-five healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled, and thirty CSAP patients were divided into two acupoint prescriptions groups (Group A: acupoints on the meridian directly related to the Heart; Group B: acupoints on the meridian indirectly related to the Heart). The Magnetic Resonance Imaging data and clinical data were collected at baseline and after treatment. The comparisons of brain spontaneous activity patterns were performed between CSAP patients and HS, as well as between baseline and after treatment in CSAP patients. Then, the changes in resting-state functional connectivity before and after treatment were compared between the two acupoint prescriptions. RESULTS: Chronic stable angina pectoris patients manifested higher spontaneous activity on the bilateral calcarine, left middle occipital gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus. After acupuncture treatment, the spontaneous activity of the left calcarine, left cuneus, and right orbitofrontal gyrus was decreased.

Among a range of barriers, comorbidity particularly poses a clinical challenge in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment owing to its heterogeneous nature. While accurate comorbidity assessments and appropriate treatment administration can result in better patient outcomes, evidence related to older adult cancer populations is limited as these individuals are often excluded from regular clinical trials due to age and comorbid conditions. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of physical comorbidity and the impact of physical comorbidities and rurality on treatment and its outcomes in older adult cancer populations. METHODS Scientific databases Embase and PubMed were searched for published scientific literature on physical comorbidity and older adult cancer patients. Google Scholar was searched for scholarly literature published in nonindexed journals. Snowballing was utilized to identify research papers missed in the above searches. Included studies : (1) reported on original research involving cancer patients; (2) included patients aged 65 years or older; (3) had patients receiving cancer-related treatment and (4) cancer survivors; (5) reported on physical comorbidity as a variable; (6) were published in English; and (7) conducted from any geographical location. RESULTS In total, 29 studies were selected for data extraction, evidence synthesis, and quality assessment. In these, comorbidities ranged from 37.9%-74.3% in colorectal cancer, 74%-81% in head and neck cancer, and 12.6%-49% in breast cancer. Moderate comorbidities ranged from 13%-72.9%, and severe comorbidities from 2.5%-68.2%. Comorbidity increased with age, with comorbidity affecting both treatment choice and process. Physical comorbidities significantly affected treatment initiation, causing delay, toxicity, and discontinuation. Older adult cancer patients were given less vigorous and nonstandard treatments and were also less likely to be offered treatment. Where patients are given more vigorous treatment, several studies showed better survival outcomes. Appropriate treatment in older adult cancer patients increased both overall and disease-related survival rates. None of the studies noted rurality as a distinct variable. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review concludes that there is evidence to substantiate the adverse effect of comorbidity on treatment and survival outcomes. However, the mechanism by which comorbidity impedes or impacts treatment is unknown in many cases. Some low-quality evidence is available for considering the functional status and biological age in treatment decisions. Future studies that substantiate the value of comprehensive older adult assessments before treatment initiation in cancer patients, including assessing the nature and severity of comorbidities, and additional consideration of rurality as a factor, could lessen the effect of comorbidities on the treatment process.","output":"Physical Comorbidities and Their Relationship with Cancer Treatment and Its Outcomes in Older Adult Populations: Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dissociative disorders and germane conditions are reliably characterized by elevated responsiveness to direct verbal suggestions.

We aimed to assess whether patients with a systemic rheumatic disease might be at increased risk for hyperinflammation and respiratory failure from COVID-19. Methods: We did a retrospective, comparative cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at Mass General Brigham (Boston, USA). We identified patients by a search of electronic health records and matched patients with a systemic rheumatic disease 1:5 to comparators. We compared individual laboratory results by case status and extracted laboratory results and COVID-19 outcomes for each participant. We calculated the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation score (cHIS), a composite of six domains (a score of &#8805;2 indicating hyperinflammation) and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 outcomes by hyperinflammation and case status. Findings: We identified 57 patients with a systemic rheumatic disease and 232 matched comparators who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between Jan 30 and July 7, 2020; 38 (67%) patients with a rheumatic disease were female compared with 158 (68%) matched comparators. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (96 [IQR 64-222] vs 78 [45-165]; p=0021), lactate dehydrogenase concentration (421 U/L [297-528] vs 345 U/L [254-479]; p=0044), creatinine concentration (12 mg/dL [09-20] vs 10 mg/dL [08-14], p=0014), and blood urea nitrogen concentration (31 mg/dL [15-61] vs 23 mg/dL [13-37]; p=0033) than comparators, but median C-reactive protein concentration (1494 mg/L [764-2753] vs 1163 mg/L [588-2259]; p=011) was not significantly different. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median cHIS than comparators (3 [1-5] vs 2 [1-4]; p=0013). All patients with a peak cHIS of 2 or more had higher odds of admission to intensive care (OR 345 [95% CI 198-599]), mechanical ventilation (6620 [898-48780]), and in-hospital mortality (1637 [475-5638]) than patients with a peak cHIS of less than 2. In adjusted analyses, patients with a rheumatic disease had higher odds of admission to intensive care (208 [109-396]) and mechanical ventilation (260 [132-512]) than comparators, but not in-hospital mortality (1.78 [079-402]). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, risk of rehospitalisation (108 [037-316]) and mortality within 60 days (120 [058-247]) was similar in patients and comparators. Interpretation: Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 had increased risk for hyperinflammation, kidney injury, admission to intensive care, and mechanical ventilation compared with matched comparators. However, among patients who survived, post-discharge outcomes were not significantly different. The cHIS identified patients with hyperinflammation, which was strongly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes in both patients with a rheumatic disease and comparators. Clinicians should be aware that patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 could be susceptible to hyperinflammation and poor hospital outcomes.

By March 24, about 130 had tested positive for COVID-19, and by March 27, the number had increased to 162. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak. We take two perspectives: the first analysis focuses on the relationship between the estimated number of cruise passengers landing and the number of COVID-19 cases. We tracked the movement of all ocean cruise ships around the world using automatic identification system data from January to March 2020. We found that countries with arrival and departure ports and with ports that continued to accept cruise ships until March have a higher COVID-19 infection rate than countries that did not. The second analysis focuses on the characteristics of cruise ships infected with COVID-19. For this purpose, we utilize the list named Cruise ships affected by COVID-19 released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to effectively respond. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of strengthening the mental health system through technology-enabled care coordination on mental health and suicide outcomes. METHODS: A system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behavior. The model reproduced historic time series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030. These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care coordination. Each scenario was tested using both pre- and post-COVID-19 social and economic conditions. RESULTS: Technology-enabled care coordination was forecast to deliver a reduction in self-harm hospitalizations and suicide deaths by 6.71% (95% interval 5.63%-7.87%), mental health-related ED presentations by 10.33% (95% interval 8.58%-12.19%), and the prevalence of high psychological distress by 1.76 percentage points (95% interval 1.35-2.32 percentage points). Scenario testing demonstrated that increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth had substantially lower impacts. This pattern of results was replicated under post-COVID-19 conditions with technology-enabled care coordination being the only tested scenario, which was forecast to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The use of technology-enabled care coordination is likely to improve mental health and suicide outcomes. The substantially lower effectiveness of targeting individual components of the mental health system (ie, increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth) reiterates that strengthening the whole system has the greatest impact on patient outcomes. Investments into more of the same types of programs and services alone will not be enough to improve outcomes; instead, new models of care and the digital infrastructure to support them and their integration are needed.","output":"The Impact of Technology-Enabled Care Coordination in a Complex Mental Health System: A Local System Dynamics Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We studied field collections of two flea subspecies that are plague vectors on the vast Palearctic territory. Analysing the molecularCgenetic, geographical, morphological, and reproductive isolation criteria, we conclude that these subspecies could be considered different species. ABSTRACT: This study investigated the relationship between two subspecies of the Citellophilus tesquorum flea, C. t. altaicus and C. t. sungaris, which are vectors of the bacterium Yersinia pestis that causes human plague across the vast territories of the Palearctic. Adult fleas were collected from 16 localities and 11 populations in 2019 and 2020. Specimens were morphologically verified for subspecies status and analysed for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA, nuclear ribosomal cluster internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2, and Wolbachia-infection status. Our results demonstrated a genetic difference between C. t. altaicus and C. t. sungaris. According to mitochondrial data, the genetic distance between clades of C. t. altaicus and C. t. sungaris was comparable with the species divergence of the genus Callopsylla, which is closely related to Citellophilus. All studied populations of C. t. altaicus were Wolbachia-infected, whereas all studied populations of C. t. sungaris were symbiont-free. Data for ITS1 and ITS2 had much lower phylogenetic signals than mitochondrial data; however, diagnostic substitutions for C. t. altaicus and C. t. sungaris delimitation were also revealed. Analysis of a hardly accessible report on cross experiments allowed us to conclude the partial postzygotic isolation between these subspecies. Taken together, the molecular-genetic, geographical, morphological, and reproductive isolation findings verified that C. t. altaicus and C. t. sungaris subspecies could be considered as different species.","output":"Genetic Evidence of an Isolation Barrier between Flea Subspecies of Citellophilus tesquorum (Wagner, 1898) (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The value of medical registries strongly depends on the quality of the data collected. This must be objectively measured before large clinical databases can be promoted for observational research, quality improvement, and clinical trials. We aimed to evaluate the quality of a multinational intensive care unit (ICU) network of registries of critically ill patients established in seven Asian low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: The Critical Care Asia federated registry platform enables ICUs to collect clinical, outcome and process data for aggregate and unit-level analysis. The evaluation used the standardised criteria of the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and a framework for data quality assurance in medical registries. Six reviewers assessed structure, coverage, reliability and validity of the ICU registry data. Case mix and process measures on patient episodes from June to December 2020 were analysed. Results: Data on 20,507 consecutive patient episodes from 97 ICUs in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and Vietnam were included. The quality level achieved according to the ten prespecified DoCDat criteria was high (average score 3.4 out of 4) as was the structural and organizational performance -- comparable to ICU registries in high-income countries. Identified strengths were types of variables included, reliability of coding, data completeness and validation. Potential improvements included extension of national coverage, optimization of recruitment completeness validation in all centers and the use of interobserver reliability checks.

Such information can be challenging to acquire in electronic health records, as it is often available only in unstructured text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of annotating and automatically extracting travel history mentions from unstructured clinical documents in the Department of Veterans Affairs across disparate health care facilities and among millions of patients. Information about travel exposure augments existing surveillance applications for increased preparedness in responding quickly to public health threats. METHODS: Clinical documents related to arboviral disease were annotated following selection using a semiautomated bootstrapping process. Using annotated instances as training data, models were developed to extract from unstructured clinical text any mention of affirmed travel locations outside of the continental United States. Automated text processing models were evaluated, involving machine learning and neural language models for extraction accuracy. RESULTS: Among 4584 annotated instances, 2659 (58%) contained an affirmed mention of travel history, while 347 (7.6%) were negated. Interannotator agreement resulted in a document-level Cohen kappa of 0.776. Automated text processing accuracy (F1 85.6, 95% CI 82.5-87.9) and computational burden were acceptable such that the system can provide a rapid screen for public health events. CONCLUSIONS: Automated extraction of patient travel history from clinical documents is feasible for enhanced passive surveillance public health systems. Without such a system, it would usually be necessary to manually review charts to identify recent travel or lack of travel, use an electronic health record that enforces travel history documentation, or ignore this potential source of information altogether. The development of this tool was initially motivated by emergent arboviral diseases. More recently, this system was used in the early phases of response to COVID-19 in the United States, although its utility was limited to a relatively brief window due to the rapid domestic spread of the virus.

This study investigates patient perceptions concerning attendance for planned orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 250 adult patients from the elective orthopaedic waiting list at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board were telephoned during lockdown. They were risk stratified for COVID-19 based on British Orthopaedic Association guidance and a discussion was held to determine patient willingness to proceed with surgery. The primary outcome measure was patients' willingness to proceed. RESULTS Of the total number telephoned, 196 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 57.4 years; 129 patients were willing to attend for surgery, leaving over one-third wishing to cancel or defer. The most frequent reason given for not wishing to attend was fear of contracting COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference in the willingness to proceed observed with increasing clinical risk (2(3) = 50.073, p = .000) with almost double the expected count of unwilling to proceed in the high and very high risk groups, equalled by half the expected count in the low risk group. DISCUSSION This study illustrates the variable and personal decisions that patients are making about orthopaedic care because of COVID-19.

Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Experimental Approach Several antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Key Results Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

However, little information is available about Colombian populations. The study aimed to know the frequency and variables associated with COVID-19 vaccine attitude in students of a Colombian university. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out which participated emerging adult students of a Colombian university. RESULTS: A total of 1,136 students between 18 and 29 years (M= 22.0, SD = 3.0); most of participants were female (66.0%), non-health students (82.8%), low-income (79.0%), and residents of urban areas (84.9%). The percentage of low institutional trust was 74.8%; low cognitive social capital, 27.9%; low fear of COVID-19, 49.5%; low perceived stress related to COVID-19, 83.5%; and negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines, 78.9%.

Here, we assess the risk that the accidental escape of a novel transmissible influenza strain would not be contained in the local community. METHODS: We develop here a detailed agent-based model that specifically considers laboratory workers and their contacts in microsimulations of the epidemic onset. We consider the following non-pharmaceutical interventions: isolation of the laboratory, laboratory workers household quarantine, contact tracing of cases and subsequent household quarantine of identified secondary cases, and school and workplace closure both preventive and reactive. RESULTS: Model simulations suggest that there is a non-negligible probability (5% to 15%), strongly dependent on reproduction number and probability of developing clinical symptoms, that the escape event is not detected at all. We find that the containment depends on the timely implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and contact tracing and it may be effective (>90% probability per event) only for pathogens with moderate transmissibility (reproductive number no larger than R(0) = 1.5). Containment depends on population density and structure as well, with a probability of giving rise to a global event that is three to five times lower in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that controllability of escape events is not guaranteed and, given the rapid increase of biosafety laboratories worldwide, this poses a serious threat to human health.

However, complications of stapling are occasionally experienced. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze complications of bronchial stapling. METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group, comprising 29 institutions. All instances of bronchial stapling in thoracic surgery were reviewed during the research period. RESULTS Bronchial stapling was performed 2,030 times, using 36 kinds of staplers. The total number of complications related to stapling was 36 (1.8 %); 31 events occurred intraoperatively and five events occurred postoperatively. The intraoperative complications were air leakage (N = 20) and stapling failure (N = 11), which were caused by stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (N = 17), stapler defect (N = 3), tissue fragility (N = 2), and unknown reasons (N = 9). In all 31 cases, intraoperative complications were recovered intraoperatively with additional suturing, and no further complications were observed postoperatively. The postoperative complications were bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (N = 4) and bleeding from the chest wall (intercostal artery) (N = 1). The rate of BPF was 0.2 % (4 of 2,030). Two of four BPFs induced critical conditions. Postoperative bleeding was caused by the use of Duet TRS(TM). Both total complications and BPF occurred more frequently in the main bronchus than in the lobar or segmental bronchus. No relationship was seen between the incidence of complications and cartridge colors in lobar bronchial stapling. The compression types of staplers were associated with the incidence of complication. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative and postoperative complications of bronchial stapling were studied. Generally, bronchial stapling in recent thoracic surgery was safe, but rare postoperative complications may induce critical conditions.

This calls for an easily manageable tool, permitting an all-purpose, cost-efficient, and secure viscerosynthesis. Such a tool for this field already exists: the Autosuture EndoStitch(?). In a series of studies the potential for the EndoStitch to accelerate suturing has been proven. However, its ergonomics still limits its applicability. The goal of this study was twofold: propose an optimized and partially automated EndoStitch and compare the conventional EndoStitch to the optimized and partially automated EndoStitch with respect to the speed and precision of suturing. METHODS Based on the EndoStitch, a partially automated suturing tool has been developed. With the aid of a DC motor, triggered by a button, one can suture by one-fingered handling. Using the partially automated suturing manipulator, 20 surgeons with different levels of laparoscopic experience successfully completed a continuous suture with 10 stitches using the conventional and the partially automated suture manipulator. Before that, each participant was given 1 min of instruction and 1 min for training. Absolute suturing time and stitch accuracy were measured. The quality of the automated EndoStitch with respect to manipulation was tested with the aid of a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS To compare the two instruments, t tests were used for suturing accuracy and time. Of the 20 surgeons with laparoscopic experience (fewer than 5 laparoscopic interventions, n=9; fewer than 20 laparoscopic interventions, n=7; more than 20 laparoscopic interventions, n=4), there was no significant difference between the two tested systems with respect to stitching accuracy. However, the suturing time was significantly shorter with the Autostitch (P=0.01). The difference in accuracy and speed was not statistically significant considering the laparoscopic experience of the surgeons.

PARTICIPANTS: Sixty overhead athletes, 30 with shoulder pain and 30 healthy controls were included performing plyometric rotational shoulder exercise. MAIN OUTCOMES: Half of the participants received an intervention the other half were controls with no intervention. EMG muscle activity from 10 scapular, thoraco-humeral and trunk muscles were measured. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in muscle activation levels between the groups with or without intervention. For the shoulder pain group, there were significant lower activity in Upper Trapezius when repeating the exercise. The shoulder pain group had significant higher activity in Pectoralis Major compared to the Healthy Control group. CONCLUSIONS: Most differences were found between the pre- and post-test. Repetition of the exercise seems to be more important than verbal and tactile instructions. Comparing the shoulder pain group with the healthy controls confirms previous findings that, pain patients recruit muscles differently from healthy persons.","output":"Does verbal and tactile feedback change EMG activity in shoulder girdle and trunk muscles during plyometric exercise in overhead athletes with and without shoulder pain?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This working paper explores how working from home (e.g. telework) may or may not have changed daily travel--both how and why you go places. This is of particular importance in light of mandated work from home events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While total driving and vehicle-miles-traveled may have declined slightly due to telework and shelter-in-place orders that reduced work-based trips, data illustrates an increase in total trips from 3.97 to 4.45 in total and that these additional 26% of trips have been induced by working from home. This means that while VMT and the share of driving may have declined, the number of trips and engine cold starts may have gone up.

Although extensive literature has highlighted the importance of socioenvironmental characteristics for birth outcomes, the role of indirect violence on health remains fairly understudied. METHODS: Using geocoded birth records from the ongoing Western Region Birth Cohort (Regi?o Oeste Coorte C ROC-Cohort) of infants born between 2012 and 2014 and geocoded crime reports, we assessed the associations between exposure to violent crimes during pregnancy within a 1-km radius of the mothers residence and low birth weight, preterm delivery, and being born small-for-gestational-age. Violent crime exposure was categorized into quintiles. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between violence exposure and birth outcomes. Models were adjusted for sex, maternal age and education, socioeconomic status, and risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and drinking during pregnancy. RESULTS: Among the 5268 children included, the average crime exposure during the first two trimesters of pregnancy ranged from 0.44 violent crimes in the least exposed quintile to 12.74 crimes in the most exposed. Compared to children with the lowest violence exposure, children in the highest exposure quintile had higher odds of being born small-for-gestational-age (1.41[1.06C1.89]), preterm (1.35[1.01C1.80]), and low birth weight (1.42[1.03C1.98]). While socioeconomic status and maternal education were positively associated with lower violence exposure, no associations were found between these characteristics and birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher exposure to violent crimes in the close vicinity of pregnant womens residence is associated with substantial increases in the odds of adverse birth outcomes. Policies to improve neighborhood safety can potentially contribute not only to the short-term wellbeing of populations but may also have large social, economic, and health benefits in the long term.

This precipitous shift presented medical educators with a challenge, 'to create a \\"simulacrum\\" of the learning environment that students experience in classroom, in DL'. This requires the design of an adaptable and versatile DL-framework bearing in mind the theoretical underpinnings associated with DL. Additionally, effectiveness of such a DL-framework in content-delivery followed by its evaluation at the user-level, and in cognitive development needs to be pursued such that medical educators can be convinced to effectively adopt the framework in a competency-based medical programme. Main: In this study, we define a DL-framework that provides a 'simulacrum' of classroom experience. The framework's blueprint was designed amalgamating principles of: Garrison's community inquiry, Siemens' connectivism and Harasim's online-collaborative-learning;and improved using Anderson's DL-model. Effectiveness of the DL-framework in course delivery was demonstrated using the exemplar of fundamentals in epidemiology and biostatistics (FEB) course during COVID-19 lockdown. Virtual live-sessions integrated in the framework employed a blended-approach informed by instructional-design strategies of Gagne and Peyton. The efficiency of the framework was evaluated using first 2 levels of Kirkpatrick's framework. Of 60 students, 51 (85%) responded to the survey assessing perception towards DL (Kirkpatrick's Level 1). The survey-items, validated using exploratory factor analysis, were classified into 4-categories: computer expertise;DL-flexibility;DL-usefulness;and DL-satisfaction. The overall perception for the 4 categories, highlighted respondents' overall satisfaction with the framework. Scores for specific survey-items attested that the framework promoted collaborative-learning and student-autonomy. For, Kirkpatrick's Level 2 that is, cognitive-development, performance in FEB's summative-assessment of students experiencing DL was compared with students taught using traditional methods. Similar, mean-scores for both groups indicated that shift to DL didn't have an adverse effect on students' learning. Conclusion: In conclusion, we present here the design, implementation and evaluation of a DL-framework, which is an efficient pedagogical approach, pertinent for medical schools to adopt (elaborated using Bourdieu's Theory of Practice) to address students' learning trajectories during unprecedented times such as that during the COVID-19 pandemia.","output":"Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a Distance Learning Framework to Expedite Medical Education during COVID-19 pandemic: A Proof-of-Concept Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene therapy provides a promising strategy for curing monogenetic disorders and complex diseases.

Finally, we show that our approach can be used for studying the disease progression in a single patient and its influencing factors. The results suggest that our technique can form the foundation of a more concrete clinical model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 severity and the efficacy of different treatments for each patient through using CXRs and clinical data in the early stages of the disease.

In this study, we explore whether net health insurance losses were larger in states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA. STUDY DESIGN: We apply cross\\\\sectional differences\\\\in\\\\differences regressions to compare differences in health insurance coverage source and status linked to recent lob losses attributable to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in states the expanded Medicaid against states that did not expand Medicaid. POPULATION STUDIED: 702,755 Non\\\\elderly adults aged 19C64 in the Census Bureaus experimental Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Our results are based on analysis of the Phase I HPS which includes adults surveyed between April 23 and July 21, 2020. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 55% experienced a recent job loss16% reported experiencing a job loss associated with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic (e.g. layoff, business closed, furlough). Adults reporting COVID\\\\related job losses were 21 percentage points (p < 0.01) less likely to have employer\\\\sponsored health insurance (ESI) at the time of their interview (relative to 78 percent among those not experiencing a job loss). People experiencing job losses were more likely to report having non\\\\group coverage plausibly from the exchanges, although there were no differences states that did not expand Medicaid and those expanding Medicaid as of March 2020. Pandemic\\\\linked associated enrollment in Medicaid was larger among residents of expansion states, however the association was marginally stronger among middle\\\\income (138C400% of the Federal Poverty Limit [FPL] based on their 2019 incomes used for tax filing) households (8.3 PP, p < 0.01) than among lower\\\\income households with incomes under 138% FPL (6.1 PP, p < 0.01). COVID\\\\related job losses were negligibly associated with uninsurance among low\\\\income adults in either expansion or non\\\\expansion states; however, middle\\\\income (138%C400% FPL) adults were almost 5 PP (p < 0.01) less likely to be uninsured at the time of the interview if their state had expanded Medicaid in place relative to their counterparts in non\\\\expansion states. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploration suggests that households negatively affected by the pandemic are utilizing Medicaid to insure themselves against potential health risks they would incur while being unemployed. Although our results come from a single cross\\\\section, we highlight that the strongest association among COVID\\\\related job losses, Medicaid enrollment, and potential protections from long uninsured spells was concentrated among people that would be ineligible for Medicaid in 2019just prior to the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: This study investigates an underexplored component of the Medicaid program is its ability to act as a safety net program for households affected by job loss. At present, 39 states expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Our findings suggest states with expanded Medicaid eligibility may allow households to partly stabilize health care needs should they become detached from private health coverage due to a job loss during the pandemic.

In Italy, the quarantine began on March 9, 2020, and containment measures were partially reduced only on May 4, 2020. The quarantine experience has a significant psychological impact at all ages but can have it above all on adolescents who cannot go to school, play sports, and meet friends. In this scenario, this study aimed to provide a general overview of the perceived risk related to COVID-19 and the psychological experience of quarantine in a large sample of Italian adolescents. Nine hundred and seventy eight adolescents (males = 339; females = 639) living in 13 Italian regions and attending upper secondary school (age range: 13C20, M = 16.57, SD = 1.20), responded to an internet-based questionnaire about perceived health risk related to COVID-19, knowledge and information on measures to control the pandemic, beliefs and opinions on stage two of the quarantine, and psychological experiences related to quarantine. 31.1% of the participants lived in red zones, which are places where the government has imposed stricter measures of containment due to exponential and uncontrolled growth in contagion cases compared to other areas in Italy. According to our results, Italian adolescents had a low perception of risk of COVID-19. Perceived comparative susceptibility and perceived seriousness were also very low. However, they were aware of the restriction measures necessary to contain the spread of the virus, and they agreed with the limitations imposed by the government. Females and adolescents living in a red zone showed more significant psychological negative feelings about the quarantine experience. However, no significant differences were found about the regions where the teenagers of our sample live and the other variables related to the COVID-19 experience. This is very interesting data, leading us to hypothesize that the participants negative feelings may be more related to the adolescent period than to the pandemic itself.","output":"Adolescents in Quarantine During COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Perceived Health Risk, Beliefs, Psychological Experiences and Expectations for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drastic measures such as lockdown imposed in the countries worldwide to control the extent of COVID-19 have influenced environmental parameters substantially The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of lockdown on the air quality in Hyderabad city by comparing the pollutants concentration during lockdown and pre-lockdown periods A comparative study was also made on the pollutant concentrations observed during the pre-lockdown (1st February C 23rd March 2020) and lockdown period (24th March - 30th April 2020) to those of the pollutants in the previous years (2018 and 2019) The Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to correlate the ozone (O3) concentration with other pollutants Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and O3 were monitored along with meteorological parameters like temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation It was observed that the O3 concentration increased from 26 ppb (by volume) to 56 4 ppb during pre-lockdown and lockdown period, respectively, due to the decrease in CO and NOX concentration The concentration of NO2, NO and CO were also reduced during the lockdown period by 33 7%, 53 8% and 27 25%, respectively To identify the statistical significance of the parameters, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used The present study provides new insights on the ambient air pollution in terms of the aforesaid parameters and could pave the way for regulatory authorities to implement control measures to curb the air pollution Highlights ?

The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex? test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new N99 respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of N99 over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators.. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The new silicone N99 half-piece respirator, VJR-NMU N99: A novel and effective tool to prevent COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the Biochemical Society conducted two surveys to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on researchers in the molecular biosciences.

We aimed to investigate the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 among front-line hospital workers and communities in Ethiopia. Methods We did a population-based, longitudinal cohort study at two tertiary teaching hospitals involving hospital workers, rural residents, and urban communities in Jimma and Addis Ababa. Hospital workers were recruited at both hospitals, and community participants were recruited by convenience sampling including urban metropolitan settings, urban and semi-urban settings, and rural communities. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had provided written informed consent, and were willing to provide blood samples by venepuncture. Only one participant per household was recruited. Serology was done with Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid assay in three consecutive rounds, with a mean interval of 6 weeks between tests, to obtain seroprevalence and incidence estimates within the cohorts. Findings Between Aug 5, 2020, and April 10, 2021, we did three survey rounds with a total of 1104 hospital workers and 1229 community residents participating. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital workers increased strongly during the study period: in Addis Ababa, it increased from 10.9% (95% credible interval [CrI] 8.3-13.8) in August, 2020, to 53.7% (44.8-62.5) in February, 2021, with an incidence rate of 2223 per 100 000 person-weeks (95% CI 1785-2696);in Jimma Town, it increased from 30.8% (95% CrI 26.9-34.8) in November, 2020, to 56.1% (51.1-61.1) in February, 2021, with an incidence rate of 3810 per 100 000 person-weeks (95% CI 3149-4540). Among urban communities, an almost 40% increase in seroprevalence was observed in early 2021, with incidence rates of 1622 per 100 000 person-weeks (1004-2429) in Jimma Town and 4646 per 100 000 person-weeks (2797-7255) in Addis Ababa. Seroprevalence in rural communities increased from 18.0% (95% CrI 13.5-23.2) in November, 2020, to 31.0% (22.3-40.3) in March, 2021. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 spread in Ethiopia has been highly dynamic among hospital worker and urban communities. We can speculate that the greatest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently evolving in rural Ethiopia, and thus requires focused attention regarding health-care burden and disease prevention.

The Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (NKA), primarily serving as an ion transporter, also regulates epithelial barrier function via modulation of tight junctions. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that overexpression of the NKA 1 subunit upregulates the expression of tight junction proteins, leading to increased alveolar epithelial barrier function by an ion transportCindependent mechanism. Using IP and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of unknown protein interactions of the 1 subunit, including a top candidate, myotonic dystrophy kinaseCrelated cdc42-binding kinase  (MRCK), which is a protein kinase known to regulate peripheral actin formation. Using a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system, we demonstrated that MRCK and its downstream activation of myosin light chain is required for the regulation of alveolar barrier function by the NKA 1 subunit. Importantly, MRCK is expressed in both human airways and alveoli and has reduced expression in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lung illness that can be caused by multiple direct and indirect insults, including the infection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our results have elucidated a potentially novel mechanism by which NKA regulates epithelial tight junctions and have identified potential drug targets for treating ARDS and other pulmonary diseases that are caused by barrier dysfunction.","output":"The Na(+), K(+)-ATPase 1 subunit regulates epithelial tight junctions via MRCK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In today's digital era, various innovations are developed to make human life is easier, more efficient, and enjoyable every time.

PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR DNA microarray assay (designated as RT-PCR) in the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children. This was a retrospective study of 62 individuals < 18 years old who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected for virus identification in a tertiary university hospital in south Brazil between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2014. All 62 nasopharingeal aspirates were analyzed using both assay methods. The main outcome to be measured was the difference in the proportion of test samples returning a positive virus detection result between the IF and the RT-PCR. The McNemar test was used for data analysis and the results showed that the RT-PCR and the IF methods produced 55 (88.7 %) and 17 (27.4 %) virus-positive samples, respectively (pa?<a?0.001). The most prevalent virus was rhinovirus (45.5 % of the RT-PCR positive samples). The RT-PCR method increased the detection rates of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and parainfluenza 3 virus. The RT-PCR and IF had concordant results in 19 samples (30.6 %) and discordant results in 43 samples (69.4 %). It is concluded that in comparison to the Oxoid IMAGEN? IF method, the CLART? PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR method had a greater potential to contribute to the clinical management of hospitalized children due its greater ability in detecting respiratory viruses than the IF method.","output":"Comparison of a direct immunofluorescence assay (Oxoid IMAGEN?) and a multiplex RT-PCR DNA microarray assay (CLART?

We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to analyse RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections. METHODOLOGY: A convenience collection of 1179 airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001, was subjected to comprehensive molecular testing. RESULTS: RVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype ~90 % of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were under-represented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution. CONCLUSION: Notably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data. Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not always the case. Nearly 80 % of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect. For routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.","output":"Genotypic diversity, circulation patterns and co-detections among rhinoviruses in Queensland, 2001"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an alarming rise in domestic violence worldwide Factors believed to be fueling this escalation in domestic violence include increasing social confinement at home during lockdowns and mounting stress levels from unemployment that have resulted from the economic uncertainties of these times This contribution explores some of the challenges faced by physicians in clinically assessing victims of domestic violence during the COVID-19 era One such challenge is the increased reliance on telemedicine during the pandemic, a medium of communication that offers a narrower clinical view of patients than is what is usually provided by an in-person examination In this contribution, we offer suggestions on how best to screen for domestic violence, whether through telemedicine or during an in-person encounter The history and physical findings that suggest domestic violence are reviewed along with recommendations on how to make the clinical examination more sensitive and compassionate to the needs of the victims One of the authors of this contribution (L C H ) is herself a survivor of domestic violence and has courageously shared, in these pages, details of her harrowing near murder by an abusing husband From this case history, it is hoped that readers will gain wider insights into what domestic violence means from the perspective of a victim and how we can better help save victims from this widespread and devastating social problem","output":"Domestic violence in the coronavirus disease 2019 era: insights from a survivor.

In this article, we aimed to chronologically characterize SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and neuropathology. Necropsies were performed at different time points, and the brain and olfactory mucosa were processed for histopathological analysis. SARS-CoV-2 virological assays including immunohistochemistry were performed along with a panel of antibodies to assess neuroinflammation. At 6 to 7 days post inoculation (dpi), brain lesions were characterized by nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis and diffuse astrogliosis and microgliosis.

METHODS: Data from the European Database of Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (EudraVigilance) and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 2020 to October 2021 are analysed. More than 7.8 million adverse reactions of about 1.6 million persons are included. The adverse reactions are classified with the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) categories. COVID-19 vaccine exposures and adverse reactions reported between December 2020 and October 2021 are compared to influenza vaccine exposures and adverse reactions reported between 2020 and 2021. The population-level vaccine exposures to COVID-19 and influenza vaccines comprised about 451 million and 437 million exposures, respectively. Absolute and relative risk estimates are calculated by CTC categories and COVID-19 vaccines for the EU and US populations aged 18 years and older. RESULTS: A higher risk of reporting serious adverse reactions was observed for the COVID-19 vaccines in comparison to the influenza vaccines. Individuals age 65 and older were associated with a higher frequency of death, hospitalisations, and life-threatening reactions than younger individuals (relative risk estimates between 1.49 99% CI [1.44C1.55] and 8.61 99% CI [8.02C9.23]). Outcome onset of serious adverse reactions occurred within the first 7 days after vaccination in about 77.6C89.1% of cases. The largest absolute risks were observed for allergic, constitutional reactions, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological reactions, and localised and non-localised pain. The largest relative risks between COVID-19 vs. influenza vaccines were observed for allergic reactions, arrhythmia, general cardiovascular events, coagulation, haemorrhages, gastrointestinal, ocular, sexual organs reactions, and thrombosis. CONCLUSION: The present study provides an overview of adverse reactions frequently reported to the pharmacovigilance systems following COVID-19 vaccination in the EU and US populations.

An estimated 3 billion native animals, and whole ecosystems, were impacted by the bushfires, with many endangered species pushed closer to extinction. Zoos Victoria was part of a state-led bushfire response to assist wildlife, alongside government, non-government organisations, and key partners. Here, we detail the role of Zoos Victoria in wildlife triage and welfare, threatened species evacuation and recovery, media and communications, and fundraising during and after the fires. We provide case studies on the triage, care, release, and monitoring of injured koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus); the evacuation and return of endangered eastern bristlebirds (Dasyornis brachypterus) and brush-tailed rock wallabies (Petrogale penicillata); and the development of nutritionally suitable supplementary food and emergency feeding of critically endangered mountain pygmy-possums (Burramys parvus). We share our strategies for future resilience and readiness for similar catastrophic events, as well as the development of triage protocols, emergency response kits, emergency enclosures, captive breeding programs, and nature-based healing for communities directly affected by the fires. We hope that by outlining these contributions from a zoo-based conservation organisation, other zoos and wildlife organisations, both nationally and internationally, may be assisted or encouraged to commit resources and build expertise to assist wildlife in catastrophic events. ABSTRACT: Modern zoos are increasingly taking a leading role in emergency management and wildlife recovery. In the face of climate change and the predicted increase in frequency and magnitude of catastrophic events, zoos provide specialised expertise to assist wildlife welfare and endangered species recovery. In the 2019C2020 Australian bushfire season, now called Australias Black Summer, a state government-directed response was developed, assembling specialised individuals and organisations from government, non-government organisations, research institutions, and others. Here, we detail the role of Zoos Victoria staff in wildlife triage and welfare, threatened species evacuation and recovery, media and communications, and fundraising during and after the fires. We share strategies for future resilience, readiness, and the ability to mobilise quickly in catastrophic events. The development of triage protocols, emergency response kits, emergency enclosures, and expanded and new captive breeding programs is underway, as are programs for care of staff mental health and nature-based community healing for people directly affected by the fires. We hope this account of our response to one of the greatest recent threats to Australias biodiversity, and steps to prepare for the future will assist other zoos and wildlife organisations around the world in preparations to help wildlife before, during, and after catastrophic events.","output":"Emergency Response to Australias Black Summer 2019C2020: The Role of a Zoo-Based Conservation Organisation in Wildlife Triage, Rescue, and Resilience for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global spread of COVID-19, Japan has been among the top countries to maintain a relatively low number of infections, despite implementing limited institutional interventions.

A causal loop analysis suggested that there were risks to prematurely terminating such interventions. On the basis of this result and subsequent quantitative modelling, we found that the short-term effectiveness of a short-term pre-emptive stay-at-home request caused a resurgence in the number of positive cases, whereas an additional request provided a limited negative add-on effect for economic measures (e.g. the number of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communications and restaurant visits).

During the extended follow-up (median 181 days), anosmia persisted in 26% of patients. 79% of patients in the new quarantine algorithm cohort reported no symptoms on day 11 compared to just 56% of patients in the two negative test cohort upon first testing negative (median-19 days). The highest viral load occurred within 0-2 days of initial symptom onset. Both the PCR viral load and two consecutive PCR negative sample realizations indicated high interindividual variability with a surprisingly fluctuating pattern among 43% of patients. No definitive COVID-19 symptoms or set of symptoms excepting anosmia (59%) and/or ageusia (47%) were identified. No preexisting medical conditions specifically foreshadowed disease trajectory in a given patient. Without a PCR negativity requirement for quarantine cessation, patients could exhibit fewer symptoms. Our study therefore highlights the urgent need for routine ambulatory patient telemedicine monitoring, early complication detection, intensive mass education connecting disease demeanor with subsequent swift diagnostics, and, notably, the need to reevaluate and modify quarantine regulations for better control of SARS-CoV-2 proliferation.","output":"COVID-19's natural course among ambulatory monitored outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is located in the viral core. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital. This study recommends that titers of IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 at admission is a prognostic factor for the clinical course of disease and should be measured in all patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","output":"Role of IgG against N-protein of SARS-CoV2 in COVID19 clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Fisher market is one of the most fundamental models for resource allocation problems in economic theory, wherein agents spend a budget of currency to buy goods that maximize their utilities, while producers sell capacity constrained goods in exchange for currency. However, the consideration of only two types of constraints, i.e., budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods, makes Fisher markets less amenable for resource allocation settings when agents have additional linear constraints, e.g., knapsack and proportionality constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified Fisher market, where each agent may have additional linear constraints and show that this modification to classical Fisher markets fundamentally alters the properties of the market equilibrium as well as the optimal allocations. These properties of the modified Fisher market prompt us to introduce a budget perturbed social optimization problem (BP-SOP) and set prices based on the dual variables of BP-SOP's capacity constraints. To compute the budget perturbations, we develop a fixed point iterative scheme and validate its convergence through numerical experiments. Since this fixed point iterative scheme involves solving a centralized problem at each step, we propose a new class of distributed algorithms to compute equilibrium prices. In particular, we develop an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with strong convergence guarantees for Fisher markets with homogeneous linear constraints as well as for classical Fisher markets. In this algorithm, the prices are updated based on the tatonnement process, with a step size that is completely independent of the utilities of individual agents. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget constraints.","output":"Fisher Markets with Linear Constraints: Equilibrium Properties and Efficient Distributed Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on stroke care, including the number of stroke alerts/codes, number of reperfusions, and number of thrombectomies during the pandemic compared to those during the pre-pandemic period. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central databases. The data of interest were the number of strokes, reperfusions, and mechanical thrombectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic versus that during the pre-pandemic period (in a historical comparator group over a specified period of same period length). RESULTS: The study included 59,233 subjects from 9 studies. Meta-analysis showed that the number of stroke alerts during the pandemic was 64% (56-71%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. The number of reperfusion therapies during the pandemic was 69% (61-77%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. Pooled analysis showed that the number of mechanical thrombectomies performed during the pandemic was 78% (75-80%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. The number of mechanical thrombectomies per stroke patient was higher during the pandemic (OR 1.23 [1.12-1.36], p<0.001; I(2): 0%, p=0.845). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that the number of stroke alerts, reperfusions, and mechanical thrombectomies was reduced by 36%, 31%, and 22%, respectively, during the pandemic.

Methods: in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days. Results: cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable.

OBJECTIVES: While demonstrating through software simulations the potential level of thermal discomfort healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 emergency can be subjected to, this work aims at identifying measures to improve thermal sensation perception and acceptable thermal conditions for medical personnel. METHODS: After having obtained the insulation values of individual clothing used by staff during COVID-19 emergency through the use of a thermal well-being evaluation software, the Fanger indexes (PMV - Predicted Mean Vote and PPD - Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) were calculated in order to estimate staff satisfaction to microclimatic conditions. RESULTS: The use of COVID-19 additional PPEs with an air temperature equal to 22 C (normally considered optimal) brings the PMV index equal to 0.6, which corresponds to 11.8 % being unsatisfied (PPD) due to perceived heat. DISCUSSION: The use of additional protective devices significantly increases the clothing insulation level, facilitating the onset of conditions of thermal discomfort in the health workers.

A growing number of studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations. To investigate the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible. We compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Major clinical neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), and headache (21%). Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS patients. 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognitive deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed memory recall. We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. 26% of patients reported hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter the olfactory bulb. It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment.

Co-teaching may be one method for creating a collaborative environment. This pilot study designed, developed, and implemented Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching on an inpatient medicine service. METHODS: Ten Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching pairs designed 30-minute, structured co-teaching sessions with learning objectives, evidence-based content, interactive teaching strategies and a Take-Away of key content with the help of a coaching team. Each session was presented by a nurse and senior doctor to nurse and resident learners. Our assessment blueprint included: 1. Anonymous surveys assessing the overall rating of each session and 2. Pre- and post-anonymous surveys assessing measures of interprofessional collaboration and communication between nurses and residents before and after the series of ten co-teaching sessions. RESULTS: Data from ten post-session surveys included 121 of 156 participants (77.6%). Attendance at each session ranged from 13C19 participants with 8C17 participants completing a survey per session for an average of 12.1 surveys analyzed. All Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching sessions scored in the excellent range between 1.00 and 1.43 on a Likert scale (1 is excellent and 5 is poor). In response to the question What did you like best?, interactive teaching strategies was the most frequent spontaneous answer. A significant correlation between the number of interactive teaching strategies and enjoyability of the session (p-value=0.01) was observed. Measures of interprofessional collaboration and communication did not change significantly in the pre-intervention compared to post-intervention period. CONCLUSION: We created a unique model of interprofessional co-teaching on an inpatient service. The overall excellent ratings of our interactive sessions indicate that Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching is a valued form of learning. Our structured format is adaptable to various medical settings and could be expanded to include additional allied health professionals.

Both mediation models emerged as significant, revealing a significant mediating effect for job satisfaction on the symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety/depression symptoms, anger) through meaning in life, even while controlling for salient confounding variables including COVID-related impacts. Lower job satisfaction was associated with less meaning in life, which in turn was associated with more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viral load measurement using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which is a simpler procedure compared to RT-qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The RT-LAMP assay was performed by using the Loopamp? 2019-SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent kit and 10-fold serial dilutions of known viral load RT-LAMP were used to measure Tt, which is the time until the turbidity exceeds the threshold. Based on the relationship between viral load and Tt, the linearity and detection sensitivity of the calibration curve were evaluated. In addition, 117 clinical specimens were measured, and RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assay results were compared. RESULTS: The dilution linearity of the calibration curve was maintained at five orders of magnitude 1.0 106 to 1.0  101 copies/L, and was confirmed to be detectable down to 1.0  100 copies/L. The limit of quantification of RNA extracted from clinical specimens using RT-LAMP correlated well with that obtained using RT-qPCR (r2 = 0.930). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is an effective method to determine the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification by RT-LAMP compared to RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can be transmitted from one person to another Earlier strains have only been mild viruses, but the current form, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a deadly infection The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide The symptoms of COVID-19 include a dry cough, sore throat, fever, and nasal congestion Antimicrobial drugs, pathogen-host interaction, and 2 weeks of isolation have been recommended for the treatment of the infection Safe operating procedures, such as the use of face masks, hand sanitizer, handwashing with soap, and social distancing, are also suggested Moreover, travel bans for cities, states, and countries have been put in place, along with lockdowns to control the outbreak Travel restrictions, mask use, sanitizer or soap use, and avoidance of touching the face and nose have produced encouraging results, whereas the effectiveness of antibiotics has not been proved The results of isolation for the recovery of infected people have also been promising Travel bans and lockdowns have caused a slump in economies, and unemployment has risen sharply, resulting in an increase in mental health cases globally To date, vaccines have been developed and are in use in certain countries, but following standard operating procedures remain critical The countries following the guidelines can eradicate this virus New Zealand was the first country to eliminate the virus from their territory","output":"Coronavirus: A \\"Mild\\" Virus Turned Deadly Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has destroyed the tourism market, and it was essential to analyze the impact of the pandemics to reconstruct the tourism sector.

The authors evaluated their initial experience using a dual-lumen balloon to facilitate preoperative embolization in 5 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative transarterial Onyx embolization assisted by the Scepter dual-lumen balloon catheter between 2012 and 2014. OBJECT The authors reviewed the demographic and clinical records of 5 patients who underwent Scepter-assisted Onyx embolization of a paraganglioma followed by resection between 2012 and 2014. Descriptive statistics of clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Five patients (4 with a jugular and 1 with a vagal paraganglioma) were identified. Three paragangliomas were embolized in a single session, and each of the other 2 were completed in 3 staged sessions. The mean volume of Onyx used was 14.3 ml (range 6-30 ml). Twenty-seven vessels were selectively catheterized for embolization. All patients required selective embolization via multiple vessels. Two patients required sacrifice of parent vessels (1 petrocavernous internal carotid artery and 1 vertebral artery) after successful balloon test occlusion. One patient underwent embolization with Onyx-18 alone, 2 with Onyx-34 alone, and 1 with Onyx-18 and -34. In each case, migration of Onyx was achieved within the tumor parenchyma. The mean time between embolization and resection was 3.8 days (range 1-8 days). Gross-total resection was achieved in 3 (60%) patients, and the other 2 patients had minimal residual tumor. The mean estimated blood loss during the resections was 556 ml (range 200-850 ml). The mean postoperative hematocrit level change was -17.3%. Two patients required blood transfusions. One patient, who underwent extensive tumor penetration with Onyx, developed a temporary partial cranial nerve VII palsy that resolved to House-Brackmann Grade I (out of VI) at the 6-month follow-up. One patient experienced improvement in existing facial nerve weakness after embolization. CONCLUSIONS Scepter catheter-based Onyx embolization seems to be safe and effective. It was associated with excellent distal tumor vasculature penetration and holds promise as an adjunct to conventional transarterial Onyx embolization of paragangliomas. However, the ease of tumor penetration should encourage caution in practitioners who may be able to effect comparable improvement in blood loss with more conservative proximal Onyx penetration.","output":"Initial experience with dual-lumen balloon catheter injection for preoperative Onyx embolization of skull base paragangliomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klebsiella oxytoca is a gram-negative bacterium.

Several studies have highlighted the psychological impacts of the outbreak in Hong Kong but have largely ignored the protective factors that contribute to resilience among vulnerable families. This study adopted an ecological resilience framework to explore the impact of this epidemic on members of families with youth with a delinquent tendency/mental health concerns and the ecological protective factors for these vulnerable families. METHODS: Random sampling based on a sampling frame provided by one of the largest local social service organizations in Hong Kong led to the recruitment of 407 respondents who were interviewed using a battery of standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: The results showed that 30.6% and 11.5% of respondents reported a moderate and a severe level of psychological distress, respectively, almost double the percentages reported in a previous study conducted in Hong Kong before the COVID-19 outbreak. Around 36.6% of respondents indicated they had encountered financial problems and almost 40% indicated aggravated financial circumstances since the outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that financial stress was the strongest predictor of psychological distress. Structural equation modeling indicated that family support, indoor leisure activities and community resources significantly mediated the negative influence of COVID-19-related stressors on psychological distress of family members. CONCLUSION: Family leisure activities, family support, community spirit and mutual help within the context of social-distancing restrictions may need to be promoted to benefit vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Risk and resilience of vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the impact of COVID-19: an ecological resilience perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The neural processing of incoming stimuli can be analysed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) through event-related potentials (ERPs). The P3 component is largely investigated as it represents an important psychophysiological marker of psychiatric disorders. This is composed by several subcomponents, such as P3a and P3b, reflecting distinct but interrelated sensory and cognitive processes of incoming stimuli. Due to the low EEG signal-to-noise-ratio, ERPs emerge only after an averaging procedure across trials and subjects. Thus, this canonical ERP analysis lacks in the ability to highlight EEG neural signatures at the level of single-subject and single-trial. In this study, a deep learning-based workflow is investigated to enhance EEG neural signatures related to P3 subcomponents already at single-subject and at single-trial level. This was based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an explanation technique (ET). The CNN was trained using two different strategies to produce saliency representations enhancing signatures shared across subjects or more specific for each subject and trial. Cross-subject saliency representations matched the signatures already emerging from ERPs, i.e., P3a and P3b-related activity within 350-400 ms (frontal sites) and 400-650 ms (parietal sites) post-stimulus, validating the CNN+ET respect to canonical ERP analysis. Single-subject and single-trial saliency representations enhanced P3 signatures already at the single-trial scale, while EEG-derived representations at single-subject and single-trial level provided no or only mildly evident signatures. Empowering the analysis of P3 modulations at single-subject and at single-trial level, CNN+ET could be useful to provide insights about neural processes linking sensory stimulation, cognition and behaviour.","output":"Deep learning-based EEG analysis: investigating P3 ERP components."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel ?-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries.

METHODS The authors performed an ecologic analysis for April through July 2009 using data from 23 EDs in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an administrative database of widely distributed U.S. children's hospitals. All ED visits during the study period were included, and data from the 5 prior years were used for establishing expected values. Primary outcome measures included observed-to-expected ratios for ED visits for all reasons and for influenza-related illness (IRI). RESULTS Overall, 390,983 visits, and 88,885 visits for IRI, were included for Calendar Weeks 16 through 29, when 2009 H1N1 influenza was circulating. The subset of 106,330 visits and 31,703 IRI visits made to the 14 hospitals experiencing the authors' definition of ED surge during Weeks 16 to 29 was also studied. During surge weeks, the 14 EDs experienced 29% more total visits and 51% more IRI visits than expected (p < 0.01 for both comparisons). Of ED IRI visits during surge weeks, only 4.8% were admitted to non-intensive care beds (70% of expected, p < 0.01), 0.19% were admitted to intensive care units (44% of expected, p < 0.01), and 0.01% received mechanical ventilation (5.0% of expected, p < 0.01). Factors associated with more-than-expected visits included ages 2-17 years, payer type, and asthma. No factors were associated with more-than-expected hospitalizations from the ED.

This shift provided an opportunity to identify limitations in the current healthcare infrastructure and how these may impact the health and well-being of persons with HD. OBJECTIVE The study objectives were to assess the feasibility of remote healthcare delivery in HD patients, to identify socioeconomic factors which may explain differences in feasibility and to evaluate the impact of safer-at-home orders on HD patient stress levels. METHODS This observational study of a clinical HD population during the 'safer-at-home' orders asked patients or caregivers about their current access to healthcare resources and patient stress levels. A chart review allowed for an assessment of socioeconomic status and characterization of HD severity. RESULTS Two-hundred and twelve HD patients were contacted with 156 completing the survey. During safer-at-home orders, the majority of HD patients were able to obtain medications and see a physician; however, 25% of patients would not commit to regular telehealth visits, and less than 50% utilized an online healthcare platform. We found that 37% of participants were divorced/single, 39% had less than a high school diploma, and nearly 20% were uninsured or on low-income health insurance. Patient stress levels correlated with disease burden. CONCLUSION A significant portion of HD participants were not willing to participate in telehealth services. Potential explanations for these limitations may include socioeconomic barriers and caregiving structure.

Evidence-based design, specifically, seeks to understand the ways in which the built environment can support the healing process. In the context of palliative care, however, the very measure of healing differs vastly. Physicians Mount and Kearney suggest that 'it is possible to die healed', and that such healing can be facilitated through the provision of 'a secure environment grounded in a sense of connectedness' (2003: 657). Acknowledging this critical difference raises important questions around the various ways through which the built environment might support healing, but also about the potential of architecture to impart care. This paper reports on 15 interviews with architects, experienced in the design of palliative care settings, from the UK, USA and Australia, to provide a deeper understanding of the questions being asked within the briefing processes for these facilities, the intentions embedded in the ways that architects respond, and the kinds of compromises deemed allowable (by various stakeholders) within the procurement process. Our findings suggest that palliative care architects often respond to two briefs, one explicit and the other unspoken. Design responses in relation to the first include: formally expressing a differentiation in the philosophy of care (signalling difference), attention to quality, extending comfort and providing 'moments'. The second relates to the unburdening of palliative care facilities from their associative baggage and responding to the tension between the physical and imaginative inhabitation of space. In revealing the presence of this hidden brief, and the relationship between the two, this paper invites a broader discussion regarding the capacity of architecture to support palliative care patients, their families and staff.","output":"Unburdening expectation and operating between: architecture in support of palliative care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 10% of the general population will experience depression in adulthood.

Aim: We aimed to investigate the characteristics of comorbidities and their relationship with disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 718 COVID-19 patients were divided into five clinical type groups and eight age-interval groups. The characteristics of comorbidities were compared between the different clinical type groups and between the different age-interval groups, and their relationships with disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were assessed. Results: Approximately 91.23% (655/718) of COVID-19 patients were younger than 60 years old. Approximately 64.76% (465/718) had one or more comorbidities, and common comorbidities included non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), hyperuricaemia, and gout. COVID-19 patients with comorbidities were older, especially those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, DM, COPD, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CVD were mainly found in severe COVID-19 patients. According to spearman correlation analysis the number of comorbidities was correlated positively with disease severity, the number of comorbidities and NAFLD were correlated positively with virus negative conversion time, hypertension, CKD and CVD were primarily associated with those who died, and the above-mentioned correlation existed independently of age. Risk factors included age, the number of comorbidities and hyperlipidaemia for disease severity, the number of comorbidities, hyperlipidaemia, NAFLD and COPD for the virus negative conversion time, and the number of comorbidities and CKD for prognosis. Number of comorbidities and age played a predictive role in disease progression and outcomes. Conclusion: Not only high number and specific comorbidities but also age are closely related to progression and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, frontline and non-frontline HCWs were recruited from a COVID-19 screening hospital in Sri Lanka. Mental health impact was assessed using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Sociodemographic data and perceptions of social and occupational circumstances were gathered. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square and logistic regression. Odds ratios were calculated for the effect of different perceptions on psychological morbidity. Results A total of 467 HCWs participated, comprising 244 (52.2%) frontline and 223 (47.8%) non-frontline workers, with female preponderance (n=341, 77%). Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs were 19.5%, 20.6%, 11.8%, respectively.

Twenty healthy volunteers (10 men, 10 women), aged from 22 to 38 years old, were included after approval of the local Ethics Committee and divided into two groups: smokers (n = 10) and nonsmokers (n = 10). Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured at the level of each individual's calves during an ischemia and reperfusion test. In addition, during the ischemia phase, the slope of decline in StO2 was determined. Therefore, for each group, we were able to deduce the speed of desaturation (StO2/ischemia time). The same was applied for resaturation rates during the reperfusion phase (StO2/reperfusion time). StO2 values were comparable at all experimental steps between smokers and nonsmokers. During the vascular occlusion test, rates of desaturation were the same between smokers and nonsmokers [respectively 3.7%min(-1) (range 2.5-12.6) and 3.7%min(-1) (range 1.8-15.1); p = 0.50]. It was the same for the rate of resaturation [smokers 30.4%min(-1) (range 14.2-51.6) and nonsmokers 30.5%min(-1) (range 18.6-44.5); p = 0.82]. NIRS study of microvascular reactivity during a dynamic vascular occlusion test did not reveal any difference between smokers and nonsmokers. Therefore, NIRS could not be sensitive enough to highlight endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects exposed to tobacco smoke.","output":"Noninvasive assessment of peripheral microcirculation by near-infrared spectroscopy: a comparative study in healthy smoking and nonsmoking volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our world is under serious threat of environmental degradation, climate change and in association with this the out breaks of diseases as pandemics. The devastating impact of the very recent COVID-19, The sharp increase in cases of Cancer, Pulmonary failure, Heart health has triggered questions for the sustainable development of pharmaceutical and medical sciences. In the search of inclusive and effective strategies to meet todays demand, improvised methodologies and alternative green chemical, bio-based precursors are being introduced by scientists around the globe. In this extensive review we have presented the potentiality and Realtime applications of both synthetic and bio-based surfactants in bio-medical and pharmaceutical fields. For their excellent unique amphoteric nature and ability to solubilise in both organic and inorganic drugs, surfactants are one of the most potential candidates for bio-medicinal fields such as dermatology, drug delivery, anticancer treatment, surfactant therapy, vaccine formulation, personal hygiene care and many more. The self-assembly property of surfactants is a very powerful function for drug delivery systems that increases the bio-availability of the poorly aqueous soluble pharmaceutical products by influencing their solubility. Over the decades many researchers have reported the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, antibiofilm, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activities of surfactants regarding its utility in medicinal purposes. In some reports surfactants are found to have spermicidal and laxative activity too. This comprehensive report is targeted to enlighten the versatile applications of Surfactants in drug delivery, vaccine formulation, Cancer Treatment, Therapeutic and cosmetic Pharmaceutical Sciences and prevention of pulmonary failure due to COVID-19.","output":"Comprehensive Review on Applications of Surfactants in Vaccine Formulation, Therapeutic and Cosmetic Pharmacy and Prevention of Pulmonary Failure due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Higher rates of serious illness and death from coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection among older people and those who have comorbidities suggest that age- and disease-related biological processes make such individuals more sensitive to environmental stress factors including infectious agents like coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness. The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations. The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.","output":"Endogenous Deficiency of Glutathione as the Most Likely Cause of Serious Manifestations and Death in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to find evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK cats. DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples from cats in the UK associated with human-to-cat transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The full digital presentation is available online.","output":"Pulmonary COVID-19: Multimodality Imaging Examples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world, representing a global pandemic.

At the present time, clinical and forensic autopsies of SARS-CoV-2 virus-positive cases, as well as handling of potentially infected biological samples in forensic practice have given guidance. However, less attention has been given to the development of specific adjustments to the existing crime scene investigation protocols and procedures for this exceptional time.

The World Health Organization suggested social distancing to curb the community spread. After national social lockdown started in India, air quality improved drastically. This further hypothesized to influence the environment and human health, and this study is positively the first to weigh it using multiple indices. The calculated environmental indices are photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP). The cancer risk, chronic health index (CHI), and acute health index (AHI) were considered to calculate the health risk. The spatial trend change in the air pollution reflecting on these indices are calculated for four Indian megacities Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Temporal variation was accounted for monthly (2019 vs 2020), one-week and two-weeks period during the social lockdown. The results showed a significant decrease in environmental and health risk during the lockdown due to a corresponding decrement in air pollution. The decrease in the particulate matter was found to play a vital role in altering the air pollution mediated risks of interest. Delhi showed a maximum difference in POCP and Acute HI by recording a dip of 70.79% and 43.53% respectively in 2020 during lockdown. The maximum reduction in health risk indices was 41%, 31%, 17%, 19% for Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.

CDC initially issued guidance recommending postponing routine adult vaccinations, which was later revised to recommend continuing to administer routine adult vaccines (3). In addition, factors such as disrupted operations of health care facilities and safety concerns regarding exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, resulted in delay or avoidance of routine medical care (4), likely further affecting delivery of routine adult vaccinations. Medicare enrollment and claims data of Parts A (hospital insurance), B (medical insurance), and D (prescription drug insurance) were examined to assess the change in receipt of routine adult vaccines during the pandemic. Weekly receipt of four vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13], 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23], tetanus-diphtheria or tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine [Td/Tdap], and recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]) by Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years during January 5-July 18, 2020, was compared with that during January 6-July 20, 2019, for the total study sample and by race and ethnicity.

Publically available data, on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, were used to fit regression models estimating trajectories, doubling times and the reproduction number (R(0)) of the disease, before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21st May 2020, and were sufficient for analysis in 89 countries. The estimates of R(0), before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published: between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions C R(0) 0.76 (95%CI 0.72C0.82), based on cases and 0.77 (95%CI 0.73C0.80) based on mortality.

We need to better understand the collective characteristics and behaviours of those who are overweight or have obesity and how these differ from those who maintain a healthy weight. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank cohort we develop an obesity classification system using k-means clustering. Variable selection from the UK Biobank cohort is informed by the Foresight obesity system map across key domains (Societal Influences, Individual Psychology, Individual Physiology, Individual Physical Activity, Physical Activity Environment). RESULTS: Our classification identifies eight groups of people, similar in respect to their exposure to known drivers of obesity: Younger, urban hard-pressed, Comfortable, fit families, Healthy, active and retirees, Content, rural and retirees, Comfortable professionals, Stressed and not in work, Deprived with less healthy lifestyles and Active manual workers. Pen portraits are developed to describe the characteristics of these different groups. Multinomial logistic regression is used to demonstrate that the classification can effectively detect groups of individuals more likely to be living with overweight or obesity. The group identified as Comfortable, fit families are observed to have a higher proportion of healthy weight, while three groups have increased relative risk of being overweight or having obesity: Active manual workers, Stressed and not in work and Deprived with less healthy lifestyles. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the first study of UK Biobank participants to adopt this obesity system approach to characterising participants. It provides an innovative new approach to better understand the complex drivers of obesity which has the potential to produce meaningful tools for policy makers to better target interventions across the whole system to reduce overweight and obesity.

In BMC Med, the mean time from submission to publication from February through July 2019 was 153 days (median: 150 days; IQR: 123-181), and from February through July 2020 was 163 days (median: 157 days; IQR: 132-191) (p=0.06). Conclusion: We discovered a steadily increasing trend in the percentage of COVID-19-related articles and a concomitant decreasing trend in the percentage of non-COVID-19-related articles published in high-impact print journals during the period from December 2019 through May 2020. For non-COVID-19-related articles published in BMJ, we found a statistically significant increase upon comparing the submission-to-publication times for the period from January through July 2020 with the submission-to-publication times for the period from January through July 2019.","output":"Publication Non Grata: The Challenge of Publishing Non-COVID-19 Research in the COVID Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) cause acute respiratory infections with similar symptoms. Since the treatments and outcomes of these infections are different, the early detection and accurate differentiation of the viruses are clinically important for the prevention and treatment of the diseases. We previously demonstrated that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could rapidly and precisely detect SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to develop CRISPR as a test for simultaneously detecting and accurately distinguishing the viruses. The CRISPR assay with an RNA guide against each virus was performed in the reference standards of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV. The CRISPR assay had a limit of detection of 1C100 copies/L for specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV without cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses. The validation of the test in nasopharyngeal specimens showed that it had a 90C100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A series of 388 CRC patients were enrolled in the present retrospective study which was conducted in a tertiary state Hospital in Ankara, Turkey. In\\\\hospital mortality was the main outcome to evaluate the predictive power of inflammatory markers, while the other outcomes that would be evaluated as separate variables were LOS in hospital and LOS in ICU. In this study, there were 260 males and 128 females, and the mean age was 60.9. The in\\\\hospital mortality rate was 3.4% (n = 13) and age, APACHE II score and Charlson comorbidity index score were related to in\\\\hospital mortality statistically. The mean LOS in the hospital was 13.9 days and LOS in ICU was 4.5 days. The CRP levels and the CLR levels were higher both in the preoperative and postoperative periods in the mortality (+) group and the difference was significant statistically (P = .008/ .002 and .004/ <.001, respectively).

Methods: Systematic review in five engines, pre-print webpages and RCT registries until May 22, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating remdesivir on confirmed, COVID-19 adults with pneumonia and/or respiratory insufficiency. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAE). Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, progression of pneumonia, and adverse events (AE). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Two placebo-controlled RCTs (n=1300) and two case series (n=88) were included. All studies used remdesivir 200mg IV the first day and 100mg IV for 9 more days, and followed up until 28 days. Wang et al. RCT was stopped early due to AEs; ACTT-1 was preliminary reported at 15-day follow up. Time to clinical improvement was not decreased in Wang et al. RCT, but median time to recovery was decreased by 4 days in ACTT-1. Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28) and need for invasive ventilation at 14 days (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42), but had fewer SAEs (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94). AEs were similar between remdesivir and placebo arms. Risk of bias ranged from some concerns to high risk in RCTs.

Here, we investigated plasma neuronal-derived extracellular vesicle (nEV) cargo in patients along the Alzheimers continuum, focusing on cognitively normal controls (NCs) with high brain -amyloid (A) loads (A+). METHODS: The study was based on the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline project. We enrolled 246 participants, including 156 NCs, 45 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia (ADD) patients. Brain A loads were determined using positron emission tomography. NCs were classified into 84 A? NCs and 72 A+ NCs. Baseline plasma nEVs were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-CD171 antibody. After verification, their cargos, including A, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and neurofilament light, were quantified using a single-molecule array. Concentrations of these cargos were compared among the groups, and their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. A subset of participants underwent follow-up cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The relationships of nEV cargo levels with amyloid deposition, longitudinal changes in cognition, and brain regional volume were explored using correlation analysis. Additionally, 458 subjects in the project had previously undergone plasma A quantification. RESULTS: Only nEV A was included in the subsequent analysis. We focused on A(42) in the current study. After normalization of nEVs, the levels of A(42) were found to increase gradually across the cognitive continuum, with the lowest in the A? NC group, an increase in the A+ NC group, a further increase in the aMCI group, and the highest in the ADD group, contributing to their diagnoses (A? NCs vs. A+ NCs, area under the ROC curve values of 0.663; vs. aMCI, 0.857; vs. ADD, 0.957). Furthermore, nEV A(42) was significantly correlated with amyloid deposition, as well as longitudinal changes in cognition and entorhinal volume. There were no differences in plasma A levels among NCs, aMCI, and ADD individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the potential use of plasma nEV A(42) levels in diagnosing AD-induced cognitive impairment and A+ NCs. This biomarker reflects cortical amyloid deposition and predicts cognitive decline and entorhinal atrophy.

Recruiters should therefore avoid to focus on overeducation since it has no impact on their job satisfaction. They should pay more attention to the feeling of being cramped when they look for the best candidates.

Physical health is not the only aspect of humans that is at risk. Globally, the rates and severity of mental illness are being significantly impacted by this pandemic. Two scales have been validated to measure the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the levels of anxiety and obsessional thinking in clinical and non-clinical populations. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19 in the general public of Lahore, Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via snowball sampling from May 9 to May 19. An online survey consisting of a demographic profile and two scales, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), was sent through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups to adults (18 years and above) of Lahore, Pakistan. Results: A total of 240 individuals (20% men and 80% women) recorded their responses. The majority belonged to a nuclear family system (60%), and their education level ranged from high school to Ph.D. The cut-off score for probable dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and obsession levels was not met within this sample (CAS, M = 3.24, SD = 4.21; OCS, M = 4.14, SD = 3.15), suggesting that the general population of Lahore, Pakistan is not suffering from dysfunctional anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Forty-seven participants' score on OCS and 35 participants' scores on CAS were above the cut-off, i.e., &#8805;7 and &#8805;9, respectively. The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship (** p < 0.619) between anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. Conclusion: One important, yet surprising, conclusion of this study is that the average adult in Lahore does not show much anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Other studies around the world using these measurement tools have indicated significantly high levels of both anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19.

Molnupiravir, a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, is one of the promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. In this study, a RP-HPLC method was developed for the determination of Molnupiravir and applied for in vitro permeability studies of self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) formulations using Caco-2 cell line. Discovery? HS C18 Column (75 4.6 mm, 3 m) was used at 30 C. Isocratic elution was performed with ACN:Water (20:80 v/v) mixture. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and UV detection was at 240 nm. Molnupiravir eluted within 5 minutes. Molnupiravir was exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions. Peak homogeneity data of Molnupiravir in the stressed samples peak obtained using photodiode array detector, in the stressed sample chromatograms, demonstrated the specificity of the method for their estimation in presence of degradants. The developed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and found to be linear within the range 0.1 - 60.0 g/mL. The method was simple, rapid, selective, sensitive, accurate, precise, robust and rugged. Thus, it was applied successfully for permeability quantitation of Molnupiravir in nanoformulations.

Research has shown that women experiencing homelessness are often hidden (i.e. provisionally housed) and have different pathways into homelessness and different needs as compared to men. The objective of this research is to identify evidence-based interventions and best practices to better support women experiencing or at risk of homelessness. METHODS We conducted a scoping review with a gender and equity analysis. This involved searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and other databases for systematic reviews and randomized trials, supplementing our search through reference scanning and grey literature, followed by a qualitative synthesis of the evidence that examined gender and equity considerations. RESULTS Of the 4102 articles identified on homelessness interventions, only 4 systematic reviews and 9 randomized trials were exclusively conducted on women or published disaggregated data enabling a gender analysis. Interventions with the strongest evidence included post-shelter advocacy counselling for women experiencing homelessness due to intimate partner violence, as well as case management and permanent housing subsidies (e.g. tenant-based rental assistance vouchers), which were shown to reduce homelessness, food insecurity, exposure to violence and psychosocial distress, as well as promote school stability and child well-being. CONCLUSION Much of the evidence on interventions to better support women experiencing homelessness focusses on those accessing domestic violence or family shelters. Since many more women are experiencing or at risk of hidden homelessness, population-based strategies are also needed to reduce gender inequity and exposure to violence, which are among the main structural drivers of homelessness among women.","output":"Evidence-informed interventions and best practices for supporting women experiencing or at risk of homelessness: a scoping review with gender and equity analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is politicians who have to decide when to release the lockdown, and in what way.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the assessment and immunization of highly allergic individuals with the BNT162b2 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective cohort study from December 27, 2020, to February 22, 2021, 8102 patients with allergies who applied to the COVID 19 vaccine referral center at the Sheba Medical Center underwent risk assessment using an algorithm that included a detailed questionnaire. High-risk patients (n = 429) were considered highly allergic and were immunized under medical supervision. EXPOSURES: Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Allergic and anaphylactic reactions after the first and second doses of BNT162b2 vaccine among highly allergic patients. RESULTS: Of the 429 individuals who applied to the COVID-19 referral center and were defined as highly allergic, 304 (70.9%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 52 (16) years. This highly allergic group was referred to receive immunization under medical supervision. After the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 420 patients (97.9%) had no immediate allergic event, 6 (1.4%) developed minor allergic responses, and 3 (0.7%) had anaphylactic reactions. During the study period, 218 highly allergic patients (50.8%) received the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose, of which 214 (98.2%) had no allergic reactions and 4 patients (1.8%) had minor allergic reactions. Other immediate and late reactions were comparable with those seen in the general population, except for delayed itch and skin eruption, which were more common among allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The rate of allergic reactions to BNT162b2 vaccine, is higher among patients with allergies, particularly among a subgroup with a history of high-risk allergies. This study suggests that most patients with a history of allergic diseases and, particularly, highly allergic patients can be safely immunized by using an algorithm that can be implemented in different medical facilities and includes a referral center, a risk assessment questionnaire, and a setting for immunization under medical supervision of highly allergic patients. Further studies are required to define more specific risk factors for allergic reactions to the BNT162b2 vaccine.","output":"Prevalence of Allergic Reactions After Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccination Among Adults With High Allergy Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented healthcare challenges, and COVID-19 has been linked to secondary infections. Candidemia, a fungal healthcare-associated infection, has been described in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. However, studies of candidemia and COVID-19 co-infection have been limited in sample size and geographic scope. We assessed differences in patients with candidemia with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-level analysis using population-based candidemia surveillance data collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program during April-August 2020 to compare characteristics of candidemia patients with and without a positive test for COVID-19 in the 30 days before their Candida culture using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Of the 251 candidemia patients included, 64 (25.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Liver disease, solid organ malignancies, and prior surgeries were each >3 times more common in patients without COVID-19 co-infection, whereas intensive care unit-level care, mechanical ventilation, having a central venous catheter, and receipt of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were each >1.3 times more common in patients with COVID-19. All cause in-hospital fatality was two times higher among those with COVID-19 (62.5%) than without (32.1%). CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of candidemia patients had COVID-19. These patients were less likely to have certain underlying conditions and recent surgery commonly associated with candidemia and more likely to have acute risk factors linked to COVID-19 care, including immunosuppressive medications.

Therefore, a quick, accurate, and low-cost computer-based tool is required to timely detect and treat COVID-19 patients. In this work, two new deep learning frameworks: Deep Hybrid Learning (DHL) and Deep Boosted Hybrid Learning (DBHL), is proposed for effective COVID-19 detection in X-ray dataset. In the proposed DHL framework, the representation learning ability of the two developed COVID-RENet-1 & 2 models is exploited individually through a machine learning (ML) classifier. In COVID-RENet models, Region and Edge-based operations are carefully applied to learn region homogeneity and extract boundaries features. While in the case of the proposed DBHL framework, COVID-RENet-1 & 2 are fine-tuned using transfer learning on the chest X-rays. Furthermore, deep feature spaces are generated from the penultimate layers of the two models and then concatenated to get a single enriched boosted feature space. A conventional ML classifier exploits the enriched feature space to achieve better COVID-19 detection performance. The proposed COVID-19 detection frameworks are evaluated on radiologist's authenticated chest X-ray data, and their performance is compared with the well-established CNNs. It is observed through experiments that the proposed DBHL framework, which merges the two-deep CNN feature spaces, yields good performance (accuracy: 98.53%, sensitivity: 0.99, F-score: 0.98, and precision: 0.98).

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the care given to patients with acute appendicitis in Korea. METHODS: Between November 2019 and November 2020, 495 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis. The patients were divided into prepandemic and pandemic groups. The baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The time between admission and surgery was longer in the pandemic group than in the prepandemic group (17.6 hours vs. 9 hours, P < 0.001). The operation time was longer (5.8 minutes, P = 0.014), inflammation was more severe (10%, P = 0.036), and more patients visited the emergency room (82.1% vs. 73.3%, P = 0.025) in the pandemic group than in the prepandemic group. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications or length of hospital stay between the 2 groups. After propensity score matching, the time to surgery was delayed (17.3 hours vs. 9 hours, P < 0.001) and more patients visited the emergency room (84.5% vs. 73.3%, P = 0.020) in the pandemic group. CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 era, the characteristics of patients with acute appendicitis and inflammation worsened.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. FINDINGS: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70  6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = -0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (r = -0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = -0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (r = -0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (r = -0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = -0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = - 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642).

DESIGN: Confidential, self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: One hundred twenty-seven U.S. pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers. SUBJECTS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center program directors and coordinators. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In March 2020, a survey was sent to 127 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers asking them to report their current hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Respondents were also asked their opinion on three ethical dilemmas including: prioritization of children over adults for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, institution of do-not-resuscitate orders, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Forty-seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers had enacted guidelines including 46 (100%) that offer venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 42 (89%) that offer venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive pediatric patients. Forty-four centers (94%) stated that the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy in coronavirus disease 2019 disease were similar to those used in other viral illnesses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza. Most program directors (98%) did not endorse that children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 should be made do-not-resuscitate and had variable opinions on whether children should be given higher priority over adults when rationing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Over half of program directors (60%) did not support the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers have proactively established guidelines for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-related illnesses. Further work is needed to help guide the fair allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resources and to determine the appropriateness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","output":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Pediatric Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little is known about specialty mental health and/or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) clinicians' experiences transitioning from in-person to telehealth care, to treat a diagnostically diverse population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Survey of outpatient MH/SUD clinicians (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers; N = 107) at a psychiatric hospital. Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. Results: Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). Discussion and Conclusions: MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services.

BACKGROUND: Factors affecting the recruitment and retention of suitable care workers in aged care are complex and influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. METHODS: A qualitative description study design. RESULTS: In total, 32 staff participated in the study. Five main themes were identified: entering aged care with a passion for the job; entering aged care as it is the only employment option; factors attracting care workers to stay in aged care; factors influencing care workers to leave the job; and preferring to work in residential aged care rather than community aged care. CONCLUSION: Issues relating to the attraction and retention of aged care workers are influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. Critical shortages in the aged care workforce make the industry more susceptible to crises such as COVID-19 outbreaks. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Aged care organizations need to create a positive psychosocial work environment for staff to improve the attraction and retention of skilled care workers. They also need to develop staff recruitment guidelines to ensure care workers with the appropriate skills and training and a passion for working with older adults are selected. Staff development programmes need to focus on learning activities that enable staff to build peers support in the work environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: There is a need to mandate curriculum to enable nursing students to receive more gerontological education and exposure to aged care throughout their education.

METHODS: 506 people aged 18 to 34 ([Formula: see text] =24.67 years 4.23 years) who filled in an online survey were qualified for the study. Assessment was made of eating habits (a modified Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ), physical activity and sedentary behaviours (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, short form IPAQ-SF), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and generalized anxiety (Generalized anxiety Disorder, 7-item, GAD-7 scale). RESULTS: During the pandemic, young adults changed their dietary preferences toward sweets and cereal products, increased alcohol (p < 0.001) and fat (p = 0.005) intake, significantly reduced their physical activity (from 8752.5 metabolic equivalents (MET) min/week vs. 6174.6 MET min/week, p < 0.001), increased the time spent sedentarily (Me = 240 min vs. Me = 360 min, p < 0.001) and had decreased sleep quality (PSQI score Me = 7.00 vs. Me = 9.00).

This study aimed to explore the challenges and experiences of providers and users of childhood immunisation services in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with childhood immunisation service providers and users (i.e., parents of children) from Kathmandu valley, Nepal. All interviews were conducted through phone or internet-based tools, such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and messenger. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using theme-based content analysis in an Excel spreadsheet. RESULTS: A total of 15 participants (n = 7 service providers and n = 8 service users) participated. Six themes were identified, namely: (1) impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on childhood immunisation services; (2) motivation and resilience for childhood immunisation; (3) Biosafety practices and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability during the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) service adjustments and guidelines during pandemic; (5) availability of vaccines; and (6) immunisation program resilience in view of COVID-19. Service providers mentioned facing disruptions in services and some parents had decided to delay scheduled immunisation. However, most service providers showed determinations to deliver the services with high morale, while most service users reported taking their children for immunisation. Families migrating from urban to rural areas during the pandemic led to service providers having no means to confirm complete immunisation of migrating children. Service providers also experienced lack of adequate guidance to deal with the pandemic and personal protective equipment to protect themselves and service users. CONCLUSION: Despite experiencing disruptions in childhood immunisation service due to the COVID-19 pandemic, service users and providers were determined to vaccinate the children. There is an urgent need for effective preparedness plans to be in place to address the observed barriers and to ensure resilient immunisation services during ongoing and future pandemics.

DESCRIPTION: Since the 1960s, the health system of Qubec has undergone four major structural and progressively integrative transformations, characterized as C modernization, shock of reality, explicit integration, and centralization phases. DISCUSSION: Although integration efforts progressively transformed Qubecs health and social services system, embedded bureaucracies impeded the realisation of these projects. Notably, inadequate change management strategies and lack of integrated funding models hindered integration efforts. Furthermore, there was variability in government prioritisation and support of different aspects of the model by making some components happen, helping others happen and letting others happen. CONCLUSION: Drawing insights from bureaucratic obstacles to integration efforts may improve implementation strategies.

All delta variant infections (8/8, 100%) in our cohort were symptomatic, compared with 64% (9/14) of non-delta variant infections. Delta variant breakthrough infections were characterized by higher initial viral load, longer duration of virologic shedding by PCR (median 13.5 vs 4 days, hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95%CI 0.17-1.17), greater likelihood of replication competent virus at early stages of infection (6/8 [75%] vs 3/14 [23%], P=0.03), and longer duration of culturable virus (median 7 vs 3 days, HR 0.38, 95%CI 0.14-1.02) compared to non-delta variants.

COVID-19 courses range from mild symptoms up to multiple organ failure and death, triggered by excessively high serum cytokine levels (IL 1, IL 6, TNF , IL 8). The vagally driven cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) stops the action of nuclear factor B (NF-B), the transcriptional factor of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, well-balanced cytokine release depends on adequate vagal signaling. Coronaviruses replicate using NF-B transcriptional factor as well. By degrading the cytoplasmatic inhibitor of NF-B subunits (IB), coronaviruses induce unrestricted NF-B expression accelerating both, virus replication and cytokine transcription.

The studies with and without face shield in both an infected and healthy person have been considered in indoor environment simulation. In addition to the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing process while using the device, we also simulated the effect of small air movements on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (outdoor environment simulation). The contact with infectious particles in the case without a face shield was 12-20 s (s), in the presence of at least one person who was positive for SARS-CoV-2. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time (80 s). The time of contact with contaminated air (infection time) decreases to about 11 s when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed. Qualitative differences between simulations performed on the patients with and without the face shield are clearly visible. The maximum prevention of contagion is probably a consequence of wearing a face shield by an infected person. Our results suggest that it is possible to determine contact with air contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 using the CFD method under realistic conditions for virtually any situation and configuration. The proposed method is probably the fastest and most reliable among those based on CFD-based techniques.","output":"Mitigation effect of face shield to reduce SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission risk: Preliminary simulations based on computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is a small, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus, in the family Arteriviridae , W.H.ich can infect both horses and donkeys. While the majority of EAV infections are asymptomatic, acutely infected animals may develop a wide range of clinical signs, including pyrexia, limb and ventral edema, depression, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. The virus may cause abortion and has caused mortality in neonates. After natural EAV infection, most horses develop a solid, long-term immunity to the disease. Marzz and geldings eliminate the virus within 60 days, but 30 to 60% of acutely infected stallions will become persistently infected. These persistently infected animals maintain EAV within the reproductive tract, shed virus continuously in the semen, and can transmit the virus venereally. Mares infected venereally may not have clinical signs, but they shed large amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal secretions and in urine, which may result in lateral spread of the infection by an aerosol route. The consequences of venereally acquired infection are minimal, with no known effects on conception rate, but mares infected at a late stages of gestation may abort. Identification of carrier stallions is crucial to control the dissemination of EAV. The stallions can be identified by serological screening using a virus neutralization (VN) test. If positive at a titer of  1:4, the stallion should be tested for persistent infection by virus isolation from the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate, or by test mating Shedding stallions should not be used for breeding, or should be bred only to mares seropositive from a natural infection or from vaccination, the mares should be subsequently isolated from seronegative horses for three weeks after natural or artificial insemination. A live attenuated (ARVAC) and a formalin-inactivated (ARTERVAC) vaccine are available. Both vaccines induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, the presence of which correlates with protection from disease, abortion, and the development of a persistent infection. Serological investigations indicate that EAV has a worldwide distribution and that its prevalence is increasing. As a consequence, an increasing number of equine viral arteritis (EVA) outbreaks is being reported. This trend is likely to continue unless action is taken to slow or halt the transmission of this agent through semen.","output":"Equine arteritis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic made eHealth literacy skills and online health activities essential for seniors.

(b) To explore the effect of eHealth literacy dimensions on participants personal health knowledge. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample of 298 Israeli seniors aged 65 or over during the second lockdown. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (a) background characteristics, (b) an eHealth Literacy scale, and (c) perceived personal health knowledge. RESULTS: Participants with an excellent health status reported higher levels of awareness of sources and perceived efficiency than participants with poor or good health statuses. Furthermore, participants with a graduate degree understand online information better than participants with a high school education. Moreover, it was found that participants with a high school education sense that they are being smart on the net more than participants with an undergraduate degree. Finally, we found that eHealth literacy dimensions influenced the participants personal health knowledge. CONCLUSION: As the population ages, it becomes more at risk for disease, and as a result, its health status weakens. Therefore, it is important to provide seniors with appropriate intervention programs for improving their eHealth literacy, which may eliminate health inequality.

OBJECTIVE: We attempt to better understand the relationship of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based, observational study. All patients with normal baseline QTc interval who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at two hospitals in Ohio, USA were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had QTc prolongation, and 210 patients continued to have normal QTc during hospitalization. The baseline QTc intervals were comparable in the two groups. Patients with QTc prolongation were older (mean age 67 vs. 60, P 0.003), more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease (48% versus 26%, P 0.001), ischemic heart disease (29% versus 17%, P 0.026), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (16% versus 8%, P 0.042), chronic kidney disease (23% versus 10%, P 0.005), and end-stage renal disease (12% versus 1%, P < 0.001). Patients with QTc prolongation were more likely to have received hydroxychloroquine (75% versus 59%, P 0.018), azithromycin (18% vs. 14%, P 0.034), a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (29% vs 7%, P < 0.001), more than 1 QT prolonging agents (59% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Patients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) were less likely to develop QTc prolongation (11% versus 26%, P 0.014). QTc prolongation was not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, ESRD, underlying cardiovascular disease, potential virus mediated cardiac injury, and drugs like hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, contribute to QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients.

The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of HAI and its associated risk factors in elderly patients following cardiac surgery and to build a nomogram as a predictive model. Methods: We developed and internally validated a predictive model from a retrospective cohort of 6405 patients aged 70 years, who were admitted to our hospital and underwent cardiac surgery. The primary outcome was HAI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors significantly associated with HAI. The performance of the established nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. Internal validation was achieved by bootstrap sampling with 1000 repetitions to reduce the overfit bias. Results: Independent factors derived from the multivariable analysis to predict HAI were smoking, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary bypass use, intraoperative erythrocytes transfusion, extended preoperative hospitalization days and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation postoperatively. The derivation model showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.706 [95% confidence interval 0.671-0.740], and good calibration [Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.139].

This paper introduces an efficient and comprehensive utilization process of high-temperature molten steel slag. The waste heat energy in the high-temperature molten steel slag can be fully recovered through the three-stage heat exchange. Through mass balance and energy balance, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 81.42 pct when the waste heat stored in steel slag is converted into usable heat energy, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 27.93 pct. When the waste heat stored in the steel slag is converted for electric energy, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 24.49 pct, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 33.83 pct. When the waste heat stored in steel slag is used for cogeneration, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 83.98 pct, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 38 pct. The normal-temperature solid steel slag produced by the process is easy for iron selection and subsequent high value-added utilization. The solidification of steel slag in this process consumes a large amount of CO(2) so that the free calcium oxide (f-CaO) in the steel slag is fixed, which is more conducive to subsequent utilization, thereby achieving the purpose of energy saving and emission reduction.

METHODS Following instrumentation, an open chest wound was created in the left thorax of spontaneously air-breathing anesthetized pigs (n = 26; 43 kg). Autologous fresh blood (226 mL) was then infused into the pleural cavity to produce HPTX. The chest wounds were then sealed with CSs. The sealant strength and venting function of CSs were challenged by infusion of 50 mL more blood directly into the chest wound and incremental air injections into the pleural cavity. Tension HPTX was defined as intrapleural (IP) pressure equal to or more than +1 mm Hg and more than 20% deviation in physiologic measurements. RESULTS An open chest wound with HPTX raised IP pressure (~ -0.7 mm Hg) and caused labored breathing and reductions in PaO2 and SvO2 (p < 0.01). Sealing the wounds with the CSs restored IP pressure, and improved breathing and oxygenation. Subsequent blood infusion into the wound and IP air injections produced CS-dependent responses. Chest seals with one-way valves (Bolin and SAM) did not evacuate the blood efficiently; pooled blood either detached the CSs from skin and leaked out (75%), or clotted and clogged the valve and led to tension HPTX (25%). Conversely, CSs with laminar venting channels allowed escape of blood and air from the pleural cavity and maintained IP pressure and oxygenation near normal levels. Success rates were 100% for Sentinel and Russell (6/6); 67% for HyFin (4/6); 25% for SAM (1/4); and 0% for Bolin (0/4) CSs (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION The sealant and valve function of vented CS differed widely in the presence of bleeding chest wounds. Medics should be equipped with more effective CSs for treating HPTX in the field.","output":"Do vented chest seals differ in efficacy?

As treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer improves, the incidence of men with intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer is increasing. Radiation therapy for treatment of intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer is systematically reviewed. A comprehensive review examining peer-reviewed, English language articles from 1990 to 2015 was performed on multiple databases, yielding 1274 articles. These articles were reviewed and selected for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients with intracranial metastases from prostate cancer; (2) patients underwent radiation therapy as primary or adjuvant therapy; (3) the sample size of patients was larger than 2. All studies that met inclusion criteria utilized whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in at least one patient. Other treatment regimens included stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), surgical resection followed by WBRT, as well as concurrent cabazitaxel and WBRT. The range of average time from initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to diagnosis of brain metastasis was 29-45 months. The range of reported median survival time after WBRT was 4-9 months, whereas median survivals after SRS ranged from 9 to 13 months. Intracranial metastases from prostate cancer occur late in the disease process, and are increasing as novel therapies for metastatic disease prolong survival. The reviewed literature suggests that outcomes of patients with prostate cancer intracranial metastases appear similar to those of intracranial metastases from other histologies. Prospective examinations of systemic therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier in conjunction with targeted radiotherapy appear warranted for this increasingly common clinical problem.","output":"Radiotherapy for cranial and brain metastases from prostate cancer: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The insurance market has been greatly impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is a lack of knowledge about how integrated care is implemented in practice. Our study assessed its implementation in six areas: identification of patients, treatment, health education, self-management support, structured collaboration and organisation of care. METHODS: This was a mixed methods study based on a triangulation method using quantitative and qualitative data. It took place in different types of primary health care organisations, in one urban and two rural regions of Slovenia. The main instrument for data collection was the Integrated Care Package (ICP) Grid, assessed through four methods: 1) a document analysis (of a current health policy and available protocols; 2) observation of the infrastructure of health centres, organisation of work, patient flow, interaction of patients with health professionals; 3) interview with key informants and 4) review of medical documentation of selected patients. RESULTS: The implementation of the integrated care in Slovenia was assessed with the overall ICP score of 3.7 points (out of 5 possible points). The element Identification was almost fully implemented, while the element Self-management support was weakly implemented. DISCUSSION: The implementation of the integrated care of patients with diabetes and/or hypertension in Slovenian primary health care organisations achieved high levels of implementation. However, some week points were identified. CONCLUSION: Integrated care of the chronic patients in Slovenia is already provided at high levels, but the area of self-management support could be improved.","output":"Implementation of Integrated Primary Care for Patients with Diabetes and Hypertension: A Case from Slovenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting many countries globally.(1) As of 23rd July 2020, there have been 297,146 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK and 45,554 people who tested positive for the virus have died.(2) Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and experiencing more severe outcomes.(3-6) The higher risk is driven by a compromised immune system, the use of immunosuppressive agents and patient characteristics aligning with key risk factors - patients with MM are often elderly and have multiple co-morbidities.(7) In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, NHS England and NICE have issued guidance to modify usual care to reduce patient exposure to COVID-19. For patients with cancer, NICE recommend delivering systemic anti-cancer treatment in different and less immunosuppressive regimens, different locations (ideally at home) or via another (less invasive and/or less resource intensive) route of administration where possible.(8)(9) The objective of this analysis is to explore the impact of switching patients from intravenous (IV) treatments requiring hospital administrations to subcutaneous (SC) or oral alternatives which can be administered at home or in an outpatient setting which reduces the patient's potential exposure to COVID-19. Methods: A decision tree model was developed in Microsoft Excel? (Figure 1). Patients enter the model and are assigned a probability of being treated; those that are treated are then assigned a probability of IV, SC or oral-based therapy. Based on the route of administration, patients are assigned a probability of contracting COVID-19 and, for those patients that do contract the virus, a probability of death from the virus is estimated. The model compares the outcomes from two identical decision trees: one informed by the pre-COVID-19 treatment pathway and one informed by the post-COVID-19 pathway. Model inputs, including COVID-19 inputs (e.g., number of active and diseased COVID-19 cases among patients with MM), have been informed by the literature and clinical opinion. Costs reflected in the model include: treatment of COVID-19, treatment for MM and administration of MM treatments. Scenario analyses explore lower and upper bounds for key inputs. Results are presented from a UK perspective and a 1-year time horizon (from model entry) is considered. Results: Per the model, treating patients with oral therapies is shown to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of COVID-19 deaths in patients with MM compared with IV- and SC-delivered therapies. These outcomes translate into cost savings driven by costs avoided in treating COVID-19. There was a limited difference in the costs of treating the underlying MM despite the switch. However, there were additional cost savings demonstrated through avoiding expensive and resource intensive administration appointments associated with IV therapies, and to a lesser extent SC therapies. The use of oral therapies has also aided the increase in telemedicine for routine appointments - scenarios exploring this demonstrate further savings. These results are driven by the perceived risk attached to each of the different routes of administration - scenario analyses demonstrated that assuming even the lower bound risk (an assumed additional risk of 10%) for IV therapies vs. oral therapies, a significant number of COVID-19 cases and deaths were avoided, and costs reduced. Conclusions: Changes to the treatment pathway for patients with MM in light of the COVID-19 pandemic aim to reduce the exposure to the virus for these patients. The model demonstrates that simply switching the route of administration can reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths . This has important implications in avoiding severe outcomes, decreasing the spread of the virus and reducing the cost and resource use burden to the healthcare system. In addition, the model reflects potential efficiencies which may extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. telemedicine) to optimize clinical practice for patients with MM in the longer-term.

NCDs are largely preventable with healthy nutrition, regular activity, and not smoking. This perspective outlines the rationale for health professionals' including physical therapists' role in reducing COVID-19 susceptibility. Evidence is synthesized supporting the pro-inflammatory effects of the western diet, increasingly consumed globally, inactivity, and smoking; and the immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory effects of a whole food plant-based diet, regular physical activity, and not smoking. An increased background of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation associated with unhealthy lifestyle practices appears implicated in an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It is timely to re-double efforts across healthcare sectors to reduce the global prevalence of NCDs on two fronts: one, to reduce SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility; and two, to reduce the impact of subsequent waves given high blood pressure and blood sugar, common in people with multi-morbidity, can be improved within days/weeks with anti-inflammatory healthy lifestyle practices, and weight loss and atherosclerosis reduction/reversal, within months/years. With re-doubled efforts to control NCD risk factors, subsequent waves could be less severe.

It is not clear whether vimentin has a role in PCV2 infection nor how it affects PCV2 infection. In this study, the function of vimentin in PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 has been elucidated. We found that vimentin had a restrictive effect on the replication of PCV2 in PK-15 cells. Overexpression of vimentin by transferred pCAGGS-vimentin and down-regulation by the respective scrambled small interfering RNA showed that vimentin restricted the replication and virion production of PCV2. A special interaction between vimentin and PCV2 Cap protein was observed using laser confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, overexpression of vimentin could decrease NF-B activity and increase PCV2-induced caspase-3 activity in PK-15 cells.

We designed four systems based on the different initial binding modes among WW domain, PRM and MoS2 nanotube, and observed two ways to affect the binding of WW domain to PRM. The first pathway, the active site in WW domain was occupied by MoS2 nanotube, which prevents WW domain from binding to PRM. In the second pathway, WW domain was bound to PRM with residues W17 and F29 instead of the two highly conserved residues (Y28 and W39), forming an unstable combination.

However, its active ingredients are still unclear and its fibrous roots are not used effectively. The aim of the present study is to discover and identify its potential anti-melanogenic active constituents by zebrafish model and molecular docking. METHODS: The antioxidant activities were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The anti-melanogenic activity was assessed by tyrosinase inhibitory activity in vitro and melanin inhibitory in zebrafish. The chemical profiles were performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Meanwhile, the potential anti-melanogenic active constituents were temporary identified by molecular docking. RESULTS: The 95% ethanol extract of B. striata fibrous roots (EFB) possessed the strongest DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and tyrosinase inhibitory activities, with IC(50) 5.94 mg/L, 11.69 mg/L, 6.92 mmol FeSO(4)/g, and 58.92 mg/L, respectively. In addition, EFB and 95% ethanol extract of B. striata tuber (ETB) significantly reduced the melanin synthesis of zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner. 39 chemical compositions, including 24 stilbenoids were tentatively identified from EFB and ETB.

Patients with diseases such as COVID-19 should ideally be treated in negative pressure isolation rooms. However, due to the overwhelming demand for hospital beds, patients have been treated in general wards, hospital corridors and makeshift hospitals. Adequate building ventilation in hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease (Escombe et al. 2007 PLoS Med. 4; Escombe et al. 2019 BMC Infect.

A recently reported air-conditioner-induced COVID-19 outbreak caused by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China (Lu et al. 2020 Emerg. Infect. Dis. 26) exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces. We argue that displacement ventilation (either mechanical or natural ventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals. Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoors, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out. We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation. This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans. We have also discussed and addressed the issue of the lock-up effect. We provide guidelines for such mechanically assisted, naturally ventilated makeshift hospitals.","output":"Displacement ventilation: a viable ventilation strategy for makeshift hospitals and public buildings to contain COVID-19 and other airborne diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Persistent olfactory (POD) and gustatory (PGD) dysfunctions are one of the most frequent symptoms of long-Coronavirus Disease 2019 but their effect on the quality of life (QoL) of patients is still largely unexplored. (2) Methods: An online survey was administered to individuals who reported to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 6 months prior with persisting COVID-19 symptoms (using the COVID symptom index), including ratings of POD and PGD, and their physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components of quality of life were assessed using the standardized short form 12 questionnaire (SF-12). (3) Results: Responses from 431 unique individuals were included in the analyses. The most frequent persistent symptoms were: fatigue (185 cases, 42.9%), olfactory dysfunction (127 cases, 29.5%), gustatory dysfunction (96 cases, 22.3%) and muscle pain (83 cases, 19.3%). Respondents who reported persisting muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dyspnea had significantly worse PCS. Those experiencing persistent fatigue and dyspnea also showed significantly lower MCS. Respondents reporting POD or PGD showed significantly worse QoL, but only pertaining to the MCS.

This paper aims to present a thorough investigation of these perceptions and limited acceptance of social media marketing among SME retailers in a developing country during a crisis. Design/methodology/approach The investigation was designed using a mixed-method design. A qualitative investigation, as the first part, explored SME retailers' perceptions of the use of social media marketing when they were faced with mandatory lockdown that stifled their business activity. The insights from qualitative study and literature helped devise the second part of the study, a quantitative study using the technology acceptance model (TAM). Analysis of responses from a sample of SME retailers (n = 149) was done using SEM in this study. Findings In the qualitative study, SME retailers were found to have a varying outlook toward social media marketing. Some ventured into social media marketing while others were impeded by their limited understanding. The second (quantitative) study showed the general applicability of TAM such that perceived ease of use through perceived usefulness influenced SME retailers' attitudes toward the usage of social media marketing during the COVID-19 crisis. An important finding in both studies was that business owners' education level influenced their perceptions of social media marketing. Research limitations/implications The investigation, albeit a comprehensive one, was conducted in a particular market and for SME retailers. This opens avenues for conducting similar studies in other segments of entrepreneurs to generate insights based on comparative analysis across segments and scenarios. Originality/value Limited or no marketing in the physical marketplace amid lockdown meant almost an existential crisis for entrepreneurs, especially SME retailers, in developing countries during the COVID-19 crisis. While technology acceptance by SME retailers has been discussed in the literature, there are limited discourses on technology acceptance among entrepreneurs and SME retailers during a crisis.

However, concerns have been raised about children being the second victims of the pandemic and its control measures. Therefore, we wanted to study if the pandemic, the infection control measures and their consequences to the society projected to paediatric prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) contacts. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study concerning all children aged 0C15 years with EMS contacts in the Helsinki University Hospital area during 1 March 2020C31 May 2020 (study period) and equivalent periods in 2017C2019 (control periods). We analysed the demographic characteristics, time of EMS contact, reason for EMS contact, priority of the dispatch, reason for transportation, priority of transportation, if any consultations were made or additional units required, any medication or oxygen or fluids given, if intubation was performed, and whether paramedics took precautions when COVID-19 infection was suspected. RESULTS: The number of paediatric EMS contacts decreased by 30.4% from mean of 1794 contacts to 1369 (p=0.003). The EMS contacts were more often due to trauma (+23.7%, p<0.05), dispatched in the most urgent category (+139.9%, p=0.001), additional help and the mobile intensive care unit were more frequently requested (+43.3%, p=0.040 and+46.3%, p=0.049, respectively). However, EMS contacts resulted less often in ambulance transport (?21.1%, p<0.001). Alarmingly, there were four deaths during the study period compared with 0C2 during the control periods.

This study is committed to exploring whether solasonine can alleviate neurotoxicity resulting from sevoflurane. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse hippocampal neuron cell line HT22 was treated with sevoflurane and/or solasonine of different doses. The proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis of HT22 cells were examined. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/FoxO3a signaling pathway was ascertained through Western blot and cellular immunofluorescence. In in-vivo experiments, Morris water maze figured out the changes in learning and memory abilities of mice treated with 8 mg/kg solasonine and exposed to SEV. RESULTS: Sevoflurane induced apoptosis and hampered proliferation in HT22 cells. It also aggravated the release of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress mediators. Solasonine weakened neuron damage mediated by sevoflurane in a concentration-dependent pattern. Mechanically, sevoflurane clogged AMPK/FoxO3a signaling pathway activation, which was strengthened by solasonine. AMPK inhibition greatly influenced solasonine's protective effect on HT22 cells.

Respondents evaluated scenarios reflecting uses of digital data for COVID-19 control (case identification, digital contact tracing, policy setting, and enforcement of quarantines). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Levels of support for use of personal digital data in 9 scenarios to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection, rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted for each scenario and included factors hypothesized to be associated with views about digital data use for COVID-19 mitigation measures.

We are not going to take a full sceptic turn: we will engage in active outreach, suggesting examples from biology and physics to demonstrate how a novel methodological antiunitary approach might help to improve our scientific attitude towards world affairs. We will provide examples from aggregation of SARS-Cov-2 particles, unclassified extinct creatures, pathological brain stiffness. Further, we will describe how antiunitary strategies, plagiarising medieval concepts from William od Ockham and Gregory of Rimini, help to explain novel relational approaches to quantum mechanics and the epistemological role of our mind in building the real world.","output":"Why Should Natural Principles Be Simple?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All papers will be fully peer reviewed with publication of the full issue scheduled for later in the same year.

In the cystic fibrosis (CF) community, patients frequently provide input into research studies, but rarely are integrated onto research teams. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a virtual pilot PCOR training program to build PCOR capacity in the CF community (patients, caregivers, researchers, nonprofit stakeholders and providers). We aimed to show changes among participants perceived PCOR knowledge (a.k.a PCOR knowledge), confidence in engaging stakeholders, and post-training session satisfaction. METHODS: Guided by a prior CF community educational needs assessment, our researcher and patient-partner team co-developed a four-part virtual online training program. We structured the program towards two learner groups: patients/caregivers and researchers/providers. We evaluated participants PCOR knowledge, confidence in engaging stakeholders, and session satisfaction by administering 5-point Likert participant surveys. We tested for significant differences between median ratings pre- and post-training. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients/caregivers, and 31 researchers/providers participated. For both learner groups, we found the training resulted in significantly higher PCOR knowledge scores regarding levels of engagement (p = .008). For the patient/caregiver group, training significantly increased their PCOR knowledge about the barriers/enablers to doing PCOR (p = .017), effective PCOR team elements (p = .039), active participation (p = .012), and identifying solutions for successful PCOR teams (p = .021). For the researcher/healthcare provider group, training significantly increased participants ability to describe PCOR core principles (p = .016), identify patient-partners (p = .039), formulate research from patient-driven priorities (p = .039), and describe engagement in research grants (p = .006). No learner group had significant changes in their confidence score. Most participants were either satisfied or very satisfied with the training program. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our virtual pilot PCOR training program was well received by patients, caregivers, researchers and providers in the CF community.

Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1-19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY200/US$28 (IQR CNY100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. It is important to improve health promotion and reduce the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 vaccine demand and hesitancy: A nationwide online survey in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionPsychological well-being has an important impact on individuals.

The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety.ResultsThe majority of the participants were male (66.2%), aged 18C29 (47.7%) from the Eastern region (66.15%), who were still waiting for the result of the COVID-19 test (64.6%). Approximately half of the sample had depressive and anxiety symptoms (49.2% and 44.6%, respectively). The depression mean score was significantly higher only among the 18C29 age group. However, the depression and anxiety mean scores were higher among females than males and among participants with positive COVID-19 test results compared to those who had pending or negative results. The anxiety mean score was higher during the first week of quarantine, but the depression mean score was higher during later weeks.ConclusionsDepression and anxiety were prevalent among people in quarantine during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia.

Data from sentinel travelers upon their return to medically sophisticated environments can also benefit local populations in resource-limited countries. RECENT FINDINGS Provider-based surveillance of travelers is increasingly sophisticated. Recently, networks such as GeoSentinel have provided cumulative trends in travel-related illness to assess pretravel risk for a mass gathering event--the Beijing Olympic Games. Data provided by the GeoSentinel also helped in determining the seasonality of dengue by region of travel and risk of acquiring schistosomiasis after a single short exposure. For chikungunya fever, detailed study of returned travelers exposed new clinical aspects of a disease previously studied in the tropics only. Clusters of hepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable disease, among European travelers, illustrated continued gaps in the preparation of the traveling public. Plasmodium knowlesi has emerged as the fifth human malaria parasite and is now a consideration in the diagnosis of febrile travelers from Asia. Automated global news scanning software is increasingly being able to detect and prioritize disease events. SUMMARY Every year millions of travelers visit countries where they are exposed to pathogens that are usually rare in their home countries. Global surveillance of travel-related disease represents a powerful tool for the detection of infectious diseases.

However, the function of many SARS-CoV-2 proteins remains uncharacterised. Here we used the Synthetic Physical Interactions (SPI) method to recruit SARS-CoV-2 proteins to most of the budding yeast proteome to identify conserved pathways which are affected by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The set of yeast proteins that result in growth defects when associated with the viral proteins have homologous functions that overlap those identified in studies performed in mammalian cells. Specifically, we were able to show that recruiting the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein to HOPS, a vesicle-docking complex, is sufficient to perturb membrane trafficking in yeast consistent with the hijacking of the endoplasmic-reticulumCGolgi intermediate compartment trafficking pathway during viral infection of mammalian cells.

One wetland served as control and was aerated 24a?h d-1 across 100% of the fractional length of the system. The second aerated horizontal flow treatment wetland was investigated under several aeration modes: first year with a zone of 85% aeration, followed by five months with a zone of 50% aeration and six months with a zone of 35% aeration. With 85% aeration, no significant difference in the removal efficacy as compared to the fully aerated control could be observed, except for E. coli, which were removed four times better in the control. No significant difference in removal efficacy for Total Organic Carbon, 5-day Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand, caffeine, and naproxen were observed. A 50% non-aerated zone reduced the overall removal efficacy of biological effects. The highest removal efficacy for the moderately biodegradable micropollutants benzotriazole and diclofenac was observed in the system with 50% aeration. This could be due to the sharp increase of dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxidation reduction potential at the passage from the non-aerated to the aerated zone (at 75% of the fractional length). The internal concentration profiles of caffeine, ibuprofen and naproxen varied from 12.5%, 25%, 50% to 75% fractional length due to redox shift, DO variations and other conditions. A reduction of the aerated zone to 35% of the fractional length results in reduced treatment efficacy for benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame and biological effects but 50% aeration yielded as much degradation as the fully aerated control. These results indicate that less aeration could provide similar effluent water quality, depending on the pollutants of interest.

Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","output":"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Good sleep quality is associated with a diverse range of positive outcomes such as better health, less daytime sleepiness, well-being, and proper psychological functioning. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality leads to many metabolic, endocrine, and immune changes. Many studies have shown changes in sleep schedule along with worsening of sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal from January 13, 2021, to February 15, 2021. A stratified random sampling technique was used. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Questionnaires that were completely filled were included and analyzed using STATA vs. 15. Results 168 medical students filled out the questionnaires with a response rate of 88.42%. 30.36% (n=51) of respondents were having poor quality of sleep (PSQI total score of > 5) with an average PSQI score of 4.242.19. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of poor quality of sleep among females (OR, 2.25; CI, 1.14-4.43) comparing to male and the relation persists even adjusting with age and year in medical school (aOR, 2.81; CI, 1.35-5.86) Adjusting with age and gender 4 th-year MBBS students were 82% less likely to have a poor quality of sleep compared to 2 nd-year MBBS students (aOR, 0.18; CI, 0.04-0.76).

We investigated the effects of the differences in both emissions and regional and local meteorology in 2020 compared with the period 2015-2019. By adopting a globally consistent approach, this comprehensive observational analysis focuses on changes in air quality in and around cities across the globe for the following air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, PMC (coarse fraction of PM), NO2, SO2, NOx, CO, O3 and the total gaseous oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) during the pre-lockdown, partial lockdown, full lockdown and two relaxation periods spanning from January to September 2020. The analysis is based on in situ ground-based air quality observations at over 540 traffic, background and rural stations, from 63 cities and covering 25 countries over seven geographical regions of the world. Anomalies in the air pollutant concentrations (increases or decreases during 2020 periods compared to equivalent 2015-2019 periods) were calculated and the possible effects of meteorological conditions were analysed by computing anomalies from ERA5 reanalyses and local observations for these periods. We observed a positive correlation between the reductions in NO2 and NOx concentrations and peoples' mobility for most cities. A correlation between PMC and mobility changes was also seen for some Asian and South American cities. A clear signal was not observed for other pollutants, suggesting that sources besides vehicular emissions also substantially contributed to the change in air quality. As a global and regional overview of the changes in ambient concentrations of key air quality species, we observed decreases of up to about 70% in mean NO2 and between 30% and 40% in mean PM2.5 concentrations over 2020 full lockdown compared to the same period in 2015-2019. However, PM2.5 exhibited complex signals, even within the same region, with increases in some Spanish cities, attributed mainly to the long-range transport of African dust and/or biomass burning (corroborated with the analysis of NO2/CO ratio). Some Chinese cities showed similar increases in PM2.5 during the lockdown periods, but in this case, it was likely due to secondary PM formation. Changes in O3 concentrations were highly heterogeneous, with no overall change or small increases (as in the case of Europe), and positive anomalies of 25% and 30% in East Asia and South America, respectively, with Colombia showing the largest positive anomaly of ~70%. The SO2 anomalies were negative for 2020 compared to 2015-2019 (between ~25 to 60%) for all regions. For CO, negative anomalies were observed for all regions with the largest decrease for South America of up to ~40%. The NO2/CO ratio indicated that specific sites (such as those in Spanish cities) were affected by biomass burning plumes, which outweighed the NO2 decrease due to the general reduction in mobility (ratio of ~60%). Analysis of the total oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) showed that primary NO2 emissions at urban locations were greater than the O3 production, whereas at background sites, OX was mostly driven by the regional contributions rather than local NO2 and O3 concentrations. The present study clearly highlights the importance of meteorology and episodic contributions (e.g., from dust, domestic, agricultural biomass burning and crop fertilizing) when analysing air quality in and around cities even during large emissions reductions. There is still the need to better understand how the chemical responses of secondary pollutants to emission change under complex meteorological conditions, along with climate change and socio-economic drivers may affect future air quality. The implications for regional and global policies are also significant, as our study clearly indicates that PM2.5 concentrations would not likely meet the World Health Organization guidelines in many parts of the world, despite the drastic reductions in mobility. Consequently, revisions of air quality regulation (e.g., the Gothenburg Protocol) with more ambitious targets that are specific to the different regions of the world may well be required.","output":"A global observational analysis to understand changes in air quality during exceptionally low anthropogenic emission conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nassib Nicholas Thaleb defines the \\"black swan\\"as the occurrence of a highly improbable event, equivalent of the nonoccurrence of a highly probable one.

A group of 267 HCWs from a hospital in the Lazio Region completed self-administered questionnaires online through Google Forms, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU). Cluster analysis highlighted two opposite burnout risk profiles: low burnout and high-risk burnout. The high-risk group had lower resilience and greater difficulties in tolerating the uncertainty than the low-burnout group. A set of general linear models confirmed that both IU subscales, prospective and inhibition, moderated the relationship between resilience and burnout (specifically in the depersonalization dimension). In conclusion, the results showed that individual levels of resilience and one's ability to tolerate uncertainty have been significant factors in determining the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on HCWs.

Several parameters of left ventricular function may be affected with aging, including increased duration of systole, decreased sympathetic stimulation, and increased left ventricle ejection time, while compliance decreases. In addition, changes in cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction, reduced contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy, and HF, all increase in incidence with age. Given the limited capacity that the heart has for regeneration, reversing or slowing the progression of these abnormalities poses a major challenge. In this chapter, we present a discussion on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies and HF in aging and the potential involvement of specific genes identified as primary mediators of these diseases.","output":"Basic Mechanisms Mediating Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure in Aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. An important finding of this study is that a central agency (FEMA) can act as a coordinator for sharing critical resources that are in short supply over time to add efficiency in the system. Moreover, through properly managing risk-aversion of different entities (states) additional efficiency can be gained. An additional implication is that ramping up production early in the planning cycle allows to reduce shortfall significantly. An optimal timing of this production ramp-up consideration can be based on a cost-benefit analysis.","output":"A model of supply-chain decisions for resource sharing with an application to ventilator allocation to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is the federal law that protects the privacy of personally identifiable information from student education records and applies to all education entities that receive funding under any program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.

DESIGN: quantitative survey of aggregated data for each Region and overall for Italy relating to screening tests carried out in the period January-May 2020 compared to those of the same period of 2019; estimate of diagnostic delays starting from the calculation of the average detection rate of the last 3 years available (specific by Region). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Italian mass screening programmes. Data on the tests carried out in the target population of the breast (women 50-69 years old), cervix (women 25-64 years old), and colorectal (women and men 50-69 years old) cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the cumulative delay (in absolute numbers and as a percentage) in the period January-May 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, by Region; the difference of screening tests (in absolute number and in percentage) performed in May 2020 compared to May 2019; the estimate of the fewer lesions diagnosed in 2020 compared with 2019 with relative 95% confidence intervals (95%CI); the 'standard months' of delay (proportion of fewer tests carried out from January to May 2020 for the corresponding number of months). RESULTS: 20 Regions out of 21 participated. In the period January-May 2020, the fewer screening tests performed in comparison with the same period of 2019 were: 472,389 (equal to 53.8%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for mammography screening; 585,287 (equal to 54.9%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for colorectal screening; 371,273 (equal to 55.3%) with an average delay of 2.8 standard months for cervical screening. The estimated number of undiagnosed lesions is 2,201 (95%CI 2,173-2,220) breast cancers; 645 (95%CI 632-661) colorectal carcinomas; 3,890 (95%CI 3,855-3,924) advanced colorectal adenomas and 1,497 (95%CI 1,413-1,586) CIN2 or more serious lesions.

METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.

Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to MedStar hospitals within the D.C./Baltimore corridor from 03/01/2020 to 12/31/2020. We identified patients who had positive culture data within 30 days of administration of TOCI-based regimens and analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes. Univariate analyses (Wilcoxon, T-test, Chi-Square, Fishers Exact) were used to compare these outcome variables between patients who had post-treatment infections and those who did not. Results A total of 220 patients received TOCI-based regimens;16% (N=36) of patients developed positive cultures within 30 days of treatment. Of the 99 cultures, 50% were gram positive (N=49), 38% were gram negative (N=38), 10% were Candida spp. (N=10), and 2% were anaerobic organisms (N=2). Only 9% (8/87) of the gram positive and gram negative organisms were MDROs. Bloodstream infections were the most common and accounted for 58.4% of all infections. Length of stay (LOS) was approximately twice as long in those with post-treatment infections (26 days) compared to those without infections (14 days, p< 0.001). Although the mortality rate was higher in patients with infections after TOCI-based treatment compared to patients with no post-treatment infection (47% vs 31% respectively), this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.09). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the infection rate of patients treated with TOCI alone compared to TOCI and Dexamethasone (16.6% vs. 13.3%, p=0.99). No cases of invasive Aspergillosis were observed. Conclusion Tocilizumab treatment in patients with COVID-19 may predispose patients to an increased risk of infection which is associated with a prolonged LOS and possibly higher mortality. We observed a two-fold increase in infections in COVID-19 patients compared to other patient groups receiving this treatment. Disclosures Princy N.

Jeju Island is the largest island in South Korea and has a distinctive oceanic climate. This study aimed to identify epidemiologic characteristics of scrub typhus on Jeju Island. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2016, 446 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus on Jeju Island. The patients personal data and the environmental factors that might be related to scrub typhus were investigated and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58-years-old (range, 8 to 91) and 43% of them worked in the agricultural, forestry or livestock industry. Regardless of their job, 87% of the patients had a history of either working outdoors or of other activities before developing scrub typhus. The south and southeast regions of Jeju Island, especially Namwon-eup, showed the highest incidence of scrub typhus. Workers in mandarin orange orchards seemed to be the highest risk group for scrub typhus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus on Jeju Island showed unique characteristics.

One major concern for viral transmission to both patients and providers is performing aerosol-generating procedures such as endoscopy. As such, we performed a prospective study to examine the extent of viral contamination present in the local environment before and after endoscopic procedures on COVID-19 positive patients. Materials and methods A total of 82 samples were collected from 23 surfaces in the procedure area of four COVID-positive patients undergoing upper endoscopic procedures. Samples were collected both before and after the procedure. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was extracted and quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction with primers to detect nucleocapsid RNA, and results reported as the number of viral copies per square centimeter of contaminated surface. Results A total of six positive samples were detected from three of the four patients. The floor beneath the patient bed was the most common site of viral RNA, but RNA was also detected on the ventilator monitor prior to the procedure and the endoscope after the procedure. Conclusions The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with upper endoscopy procedures is low based on the low rate of surface contamination. Some surfaces in close proximity to the patient and endoscopist may pose a higher risk for contamination. Patient positioning and oxygen delivery methods may influence the directionality and extent of viral spread.

Previously infected individuals were excluded from pivotal clinical trials and the optimal dose regimen in this population has not been clearly studied. The CRO-VAX HCP study aims at investigate the early antibody response in a population of healthcare professionals having received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: The CRO-VAX HCP study is a multicenter, prospective, interventional study conducted in several sites in Belgium. The study included 231 healthcare professional volunteers who received the two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 73 were previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 158 were uninfected and seronegative. In the first group, blood samples were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days. In the second group, samples were obtained at baseline and after 14 and 28 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time points. RESULTS: In uninfected individuals, 95.5% (95% CI 91.0-98.2%) developed anti-spike antibodies after 14 days and a 24.9-fold rise (95% CI 21.4-28.9%) in antibody titer was observed after the second dose. In previously infected individuals, peak antibody response was reached after 7 days (i.e. 6,347 U/mL) and the second dose did not lead to significantly higher antibody titers (i.e. 8,856 to 11,911 U/mL).

With this in mind, our team developed a model called Multilevel Integrated Model with a Novel Systems Approach (MIMANSA). MIMANSA is a multi-parametric model. One of the challenges in the design of MIMANSA was to simulate the incubation period of coronavirus. The incubation period decides when virus-infected patients would show symptoms. The probability distribution function (PDF), when applied to the number of virus-infected cases, gives a good representation of the process of the incubation period. The probability distribution functions can take various forms. In this paper, we explore a variety of PDFs and their impact on parameter estimation in the MIMANSA model. For our experiments, we used Weibull, Gaussian, uniform, and Gamma distribution. To ensure a fair comparison of Weibull, Gaussian, and Gamma distribution, we matched the peak value of the distribution. Our results show that the Weibull distribution with shape 7.7 and scale 7 for 14 days gives a better training model and predictions.","output":"Simulation of COVID-19 Incubation Period and the Effect of Probability Distribution Functionon Model Training Using MIMANSA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was identified for the first time in Quebec, using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

ANIMALS: Nine hospitalized calves with crusting dermatitis and confirmed mutation in PLD4 and medical records from 25 calves with crusting dermatitis or suspected zinc deficiency. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective case series. RESULTS: The 9 calves (age: 5C53 weeks) displayed a moderate to severe crusting dermatitis mainly on the head, ventrum, and joints. Respiratory and digestive tract inflammations were frequently observed. Zinc supplementation did not lead to remission of clinical signs in 4 calves.

To assess this transmission mechanism, we assembled data about the population and COVID-19 cases in global cities and their associated countries, comparing their infection rates on a fixed date. We demonstrate that most global cities followed a common pattern in the pace and intensity of COVID-19's spread during the first wave of the pandemic. Among our global cities sample, 75% served as the gateway through which COVID-19 was diffused within their respective countries. This trend reached 90% in a subset based upon the urban hierarchy among global cities.

While social distancing and quarantining are effective methods to reduce its spread, Hispanics, who are more likely to be essential workers and live in multigenerational homes than non-Hispanics, may face challenges that limit their ability to carry out these preventative efforts. We elicited the experiences of Hispanic adults with social distancing and self-quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. METHODS: In this qualitative study, Hispanic adults receiving care at a federally qualified community health center in East Harlem, New York, were recruited for remote one-on-one semi-structured interviews from 5/15/2020 to 11/17/2020. Interviews were conducted by a bilingual interviewer in Spanish or English, using a semi-structured topic guide informed by the Health Belief Model. Audio-recordings were professionally transcribed. We used thematic analysis to iteratively code the data. Each transcript was independently coded by two research team members, then reconciled by a third. Major themes and subthemes were identified. RESULTS: Among 20 participants, four major themes emerged; Hispanics were: (1) fearful of contracting and transmitting COVID-19, (2) engaging in practices to reduce transmission of COVID-19, (3) experiencing barriers to social distancing and quarantining, and (4) facing an enduring psychological and physical toll from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Despite understanding the risks for contracting COVID-19 and taking appropriate precautions, Hispanics faced numerous challenges to social distancing and quarantining, such as living in crowded, multi-generational households, working as essential workers, and providing unpaid care to family members. Such challenges took a toll on their physical, emotional, and financial well-being. Our findings suggest that a tailored approach to public health messaging and interventions for pandemic planning are warranted among members of this community. Further research is needed to understand and mitigate the long term physical and psychological consequences of the pandemic among Hispanics.

Accessing continuing professional development is one of those challenges and is related to retention of workforce. Effectiveness of distance learning strategies for continuing professional development in rural allied healthcare workers has not been evaluated. METHODS We searched 17 databases and the grey literature up to September 2016 following the PRISMA guidelines. Any primary studies were included that focussed on allied health and distance delivery regardless of education topic or study design. Two independent reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the selected studies. RESULTS The search returned 5257 results. With removal of duplicate references, we reviewed 3964 article titles and abstracts; n = 206 appeared potentially eligible and were scrutinised via full text screening; n = 14 were included. Studies were published between 1997 and 2016, were of varied methodological quality and were predominantly from Australia, USA and Canada with a focus on satisfaction of learners with the delivery method or on measures of educational outcomes. Technologies used to deliver distance education included video conference, teleconference, web based platforms and virtual reality. Early papers tended to focus more on the technology characteristics than educational outcomes. Some studies compared technology based delivery to face to face modes and found satisfaction and learning outcomes to be on par. Only three studies reported on practice change following the educational intervention and, despite a suggestion there is a link between the constructs, none measured the relationship between access to continuing professional development and workforce retention. CONCLUSION Technology based options of delivery have a high utility, however the complex inter-relatedness of time, use, travel, location, costs, interactivity, learning outcomes and educational design suggest a need for more sophisticated consideration by educational providers.

We aim to identify those measures that effectively control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. By control we mean that each source case infects less than one other person on average. Here, we analyze Austrian data on 616 clusters involving 2,822 student-cases and 676 teacher-cases with the aim to calibrate an agent-based epidemiological model in terms of cluster size and transmission risk depending on age and clinical presentation. With this model, we quantify the impact of preventive measures such as room ventilation, reduction of class size, wearing of masks during lessons, and school entry testing by SARS-CoV2-antigen tests. We find that 40% of all clusters involved no more than two cases, and 3% of the clusters only had more than 20 cases. The younger the students, the more likely we found asymptomatic cases and teachers as the source case of the in-school transmissions. Different school types require different combinations of measures to achieve control of the infection spreading: In primary schools, it is necessary to combine at least two of the aforementioned measures. In secondary schools, where contact networks of students and teachers become increasingly large and dense, a combination of three measures is needed. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the cluster size might increase up to three-fold in secondary schools for virus variants with an increased transmissibility by 50%, and that poorly executed or enforced mitigation measures might increase the cluster size by a factor of more than 30. Our results suggest that school-type-specific combinations of measures, when strictly adhered to, allow for a controlled opening of schools even under sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, large clusters might still occur on an infrequent, however, regular basis. It is shown explicitly that strict adherence to the measures is a necessary condition for successful control.","output":"Assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 prevention measures in schools by means of agent-based simulations calibrated to cluster tracing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CRISPR-Cas pathways provide prokaryotes with acquired \\"immunity\\" against foreign genetic elements, including phages and plasmids. Although many of the proteins associated with CRISPR-Cas mechanisms are characterized, some requisite enzymes remain elusive.

We have identified and characterised a family of CRISPR-Associated Primase-Polymerases (CAPPs) in a range of prokaryotes that are operonically associated with Cas1 and Cas2. CAPPs belong to the Primase-Polymerase (Prim-Pol) superfamily of replicases that operate in various DNA repair and replication pathways that maintain genome stability. Here, we characterise the DNA synthesis activities of bacterial CAPP homologues from Type IIIA and IIIB CRISPR-Cas systems and establish that they possess a range of replicase activities including DNA priming, polymerisation and strand-displacement. We demonstrate that CAPPs operonically-associated partners, Cas1 and Cas2, form a complex that possesses spacer integration activity. We show that CAPPs physically associate with the Cas proteins to form bespoke CRISPR-Cas complexes.

DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: The databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to January 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Primary research articles with a quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods design were eligible for inclusion if they reported: (1) perceptions of primary and/or secondary HCPs (population); (2) on implementing LIs with physical activity and/or weight management as key components (concept) and (3) on conservative management of hip and/or knee OA (context). Articles not published in English, German or Dutch were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Barriers and facilitators were extracted by two researchers independently. Subsequently, the extracted factors were linked to a framework based on the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist. RESULTS: Thirty-six articles were included. In total, 809 factors were extracted and subdivided into nine domains. The extracted barriers were mostly related to non-optimal interdisciplinary collaboration, patients negative attitude towards LIs, patients low health literacy and HCPs lack of knowledge and skills around LIs or promoting behavioural change. The extracted facilitators were mostly related to good interdisciplinary collaboration, a positive perception of HCPs own role in implementing LIs, the content or structure of LIs and HCPs positive attitude towards LIs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple individual and environmental factors influence the implementation of LIs by HCPs in patients with hip and/or knee OA. The resulting overview of barriers and facilitators can guide future research on the implementation of LIs within OA care.

METHODS: Respiratory fluids from 100 adult patients with VHAP, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in three intensive care units from one French university hospital, were tested prospectively using FAPP. Conventional cultures were performed in parallel as routine practice. Clinicians were left blinded to the FAPP results. Antimicrobial therapies based on FAPP results were simulated by independent blinded experts according to a predefined algorithm and compared to 1) those prescribed in practice according to local guidelines (real-life), and 2) those that complied with the international ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT recommendations. The primary endpoint was the number of days of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Secondary endpoints were the rates of microbiological treatment failure and cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The predicted median duration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was 0 [0-1.25] day in the FAPP-based simulation, versus 2 [0-6] days in real-life (p<0.0001) and 2 [2-3.25] days in the recommendations-based simulation (p<0.0001).

One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. Material and methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. Results: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter > 4a?cm or thickness > 6a?mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively.

Dispatching aims at allotting and sending the nearby available vehicle to the location of emergency and routing deals with selecting the ideal route to reach the destination. The objective is to minimize incident response time and the total time travel for the vehicle from the dispatch point to the destination.

The mean duration the FEJT remained in place in dogs was 3.8 days (SD, 2.2; min-max, 1-7 days), and mean duration of feeding was 3.6 days (SD, 2.2; min-max, 1-7 days). Vomiting was noted in 89% of patients prior to FEJT placement and was significantly reduced to only 24% of patients postplacement (P = 0.0001).

The biggest cluster of cases occurred in Lombardy, the most populous Italian region, and elderly men were the population hit in the hardest way. Besides its high infectivity, COVID-19 causes a severe cytokine storm and old people, especially those with comorbidities, appear to be the most vulnerable, presumably in connection to inflammaging. In centenarians inflammaging is much lower than predicted by their chronological age and females, presenting survival advantage in almost all centenarian populations, outnumber males, a phenomenon particularly evident in Northern Italy. Within this scenario, we wondered if: a) the COVID-19 mortality in centenarians was lower than that in people aged between 50 and 80 and b) the mortality from COVID-19 in nonagenarians and centenarians highlighted gender differences. We checked COVID-19-related vulnerability/mortality at the peak of infection (March 2020), using data on total deaths (i.e. not only confirmed COVID-19 cases). Our conclusion is that excess mortality increases steadily up to very old ages and at the same time men older than 90 years become relatively more resilient than age-matched females.","output":"COVID-19 mortality in Lombardy: the vulnerability of the oldest old and the resilience of male centenarians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Best books lists are the ultimate opinion pieces.

Those situated in Category A Gaeltacht districts are Irish-medium schools in communities with the strongest use of Irish and are the focus of the present study. Educational psychologists (EPs) who work with these schools are challenged to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive services for these schools. The EPs' work is impacted by state policies in relation to language planning, Irish language education and inclusive education. AIMS: This qualitative research study aims to describe the views and experiences of EPs and teachers in relation to educational psychological services in primary schools in Category A districts in the Gaeltacht. It explores how the service meets the needs of schools and students and seeks to identify barriers in provision. METHOD: The study is underpinned by Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theoretical framework and the bilingual education and sociocultural theories of Jim Cummins. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four EPs and eleven teachers working in Category A schools. The transcribed interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings are presented under identified themes using relevant transcript extracts in original and translated form and the findings are interpreted in the light of the theoretical frameworks adopted and relevant literature. Key findings indicate that both EPs and teachers were happy with the new models of special education support and consultation in operation in the schools and were also positively disposed towards Irish-medium education. However, the findings also reveal that the quality of educational psychological and special education services is adversely impacted by factors such as inadequate translation services, the lack of suitable assessment tools and assessors who were not fully proficient in Irish. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the urgent need for macro-level policies relating to children's education in indigenous Irish-speaking communities to be matched by practices that ensure educational psychological services such as consultation, interventions and assessments can be provided in a timely fashion through the medium of Irish. Recommendations include improved translation services, assessment through the medium of Irish, professional training for psychologists working with this cultural and linguistic minority and recruitment of psychologists who are competent Irish speakers.","output":"Educational psychological provision in Irish-medium primary schools in indigenous Irish language speaking communities (Gaeltacht): Views of teachers and educational psychologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses.

The fight against this disease, whose epidemiological, clinical, and prognostic characteristics are still being studied in recent works which is forcing a change in the form of care, to include transforming some face-to-face consultations into non-face-to-face. Recently, various initiatives have emerged to incorporate the Internet of Things (IoT) in different sectors specially the health sector generally and in e-Health systems specifically. Millions of devices are connected and generating massive amounts of data. In this sense, based on the experience in the health sector in the management of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, it has been determined that monitoring potential patients of COVID-19 is still a great challenge for the latest technologies. In this paper, an IoT-based monitoring framework is proposed to help the health caregivers to obtain useful information during the current pandemic of COVID-19, thus bringing direct benefits of monitoring patient's health and speed of hospital care and cost reduction. An analysis of the proposed framework was carried out and a prototype system was developed and evaluated.

Injuries of the respiratory system caused by viral infections (e.g., by COVID-19, MERS, and SARS) can lead to severe or lethal conditions. So far there are no effective treatments for respiratory injuries. This represents a highly unmet clinical need, e.g., during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Nanomedicines have high potential in the treatment of respiratory injuries. In this review, the pathology and clinical treatments of major respiratory injuries, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome are briefly summarized. The review primarily focuses on nanomedicines based on liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, which are tested in preclinical models for the treatment of respiratory injuries. These nanomedicines are utilized to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids, statins, and nucleic acids. Furthermore, nanomedicines are also investigated for other respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.

We previously proposed that the insula is important in motivating intentional movement via its connections with the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC). We demonstrated that subjects with PD can increase the right insula-dmFC functional connectivity using fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) combined with kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). The current study is a randomized clinical trial testing whether NF-guided kinesthetic MI training can improve motor performance and increase task-based and resting-state right insula-dmFC functional connectivity in subjects with PD. METHODS We assigned nondemented subjects with mild PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage  3) to the experimental kinesthetic MI with NF (MI-NF, n = 22) and active control visual imagery (VI, n = 22) groups. Only the MI-NF group received NF-guided MI training (10-12 runs). The NF signal was based on the right insula-dmFC functional connectivity strength. All subjects also practiced their respective imagery tasks at home daily for 4 weeks. Post-training changes in 1) task-based and resting-state right insula-dmFC functional connectivity were the primary imaging outcomes, and 2) MDS-UPDRS motor exam and motor function scores were the primary and secondary clinical outcomes, respectively. RESULTS The MI-NF group was not significantly different from the VI group in any of the primary imaging or clinical outcome measures. The MI-NF group reported subjective improvement in kinesthetic body awareness. There was significant and comparable improvement only in motor function scores in both groups (secondary clinical outcome). This improvement correlated with NF regulation of the right insula-dmFC functional connectivity only in the MI-NF group. Both groups showed specific training effects in whole-brain functional connectivity with distinct neural circuits supporting kinesthetic motor and visual imagery (exploratory imaging outcome). CONCLUSIONS The functional connectivity-based NF regulation was unsuccessful, however, both kinesthetic MI and VI practice improved motor function in our cohort with mild PD.","output":"Neurofeedback-guided kinesthetic motor imagery training in Parkinson's disease: Randomized trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following identifi cation of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, Cuba activated its National Action Plan for Epidemics and convened a National Intersectoral Commission to design measures to protect population health.

The UNC OPAT program staff, previously accustomed to in-person collaboration in the hospital, became geographically distant amid North Carolinas partial shutdown starting in March 2020. Team members relied on teleworking and many OPAT clinic visits shifted to phone and video telehealth. We assessed how COVID-19 impacted our care of OPAT patients including follow-up visits and readmissions. METHODS: UNCs OPAT database contains clinical and demographic information on all patients on OPAT for at least 14 days who received specialized monitoring program led by an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacist, after evaluation by an ID physician. For all OPAT courses that ended between 3/1/20 and 5/20/20 (last available data cut), we assessed the length of OPAT treatment course, readmissions, adverse events, follow-up ID clinic visits, and the method of follow up visit utilized. We compared these measurements to historical baseline data from 3/1/19 to 5/20/19. RESULTS: During the 2020 period, 73 patients completed OPAT, with median OPAT enrollment lasting 36 days, which was similar to 2019 data (70 patients; median OPAT enrollment of 35 days). During the 2019 period, 93% of patients attended a follow up visit with an infectious diseases clinician, all of which took place in person. During the 2020 (COVID-19) period, 85% of patients attended an ID follow up visit; contrary to 2019, 42% of these visits took place in person, 45% were by phone and 13% were via a telemedicine video service. Readmission rates were similar across the two time periods (16% during COVID-19 vs 14% during 2019 comparison time period, P=0.72). CONCLUSION: UNC OPAT continued through the emergence of COVID-19 as an essential service for a high patient volume by adapting its care delivery and follow-up visit protocols to include virtual care options.

In Sierra Leone during the outbreak in 2014/2015, isolation of patients in specialised facilities was not always immediately available and caring for a relative at home was sometimes the only alternative. This study sought to assess population-level protective caregiving intentions, to understand how families cared for their sick and to explore perceived barriers and facilitators influencing caregiving behaviours. METHODS: Data from a nationwide household survey conducted in December 2014 were used to assess intended protective behaviours if caring for a family member with suspected Ebola. Their association with socio-demographic variables, Ebola-specific knowledge and risk perception was analysed using multilevel logistic regression. To put the results into context, semi-structured interviews with caregivers were conducted in Freetown. RESULTS: Ebola-specific knowledge was positively associated with the intention to avoid touching a sick person and their bodily fluids (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.29; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.54) and the intention to take multiple protective measures (AOR 1.38; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63). Compared with residing in the mostly urban Western Area, respondents from the initial epicentre of the outbreak (Eastern Province) had increased odds to avoid touching a sick person or their body fluids (AOR 4.74; 95% CI 2.55 to 8.81) and to take more than one protective measure (AOR 2.94; 95% CI 1.37 to 6.34). However, interviews revealed that caregivers, who were mostly aware of the risk of transmission and general protective measures, felt constrained by different contextual factors. Withholding care was not seen as an option and there was a perceived lack of practical advice. CONCLUSIONS: Ebola outbreak responses need to take the sociocultural reality of caregiving and the availability of resources into account, offering adapted and acceptable practical advice. The necessity to care for a loved one when no alternatives exist should not be underestimated.","output":"Homecare for sick family members while waiting for medical help during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone: a mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Amidst the Covid-19 lockdown that commenced in March 2020, while the profession and service-users were coming to terms with its vast implications, the Occupational Therapy Association of South Africa initiated a Webinar series that stimulated provocative discussions and difficult dialogues. The authors of this paper deliver a commentary, critically engaging with the challenges of cogently articulating the contribution of occupational therapy services across various sectors of service delivery during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa. The challenges of on the one hand, negotiating the abrupt cessation of rehabilitation services, especially in the public sector and, on the other, advancing the reasoning for accessible, community-based services, are considered. Aim: The commentary draws from presentations at and reflections on the webinar hosted on 24 June 2020 titled 'Ethical and Moral Challenges for Occupational Therapy'. In this paper, the competing ethical and moral issues arising from being urged to adopt different ways of thinking and doing occupational therapy during the Covid-19 lockdown are outlined. Proposition: It is suggested that experiences emerging from this pandemic are urging the profession to rethink its positionality in the health sector. Two main considerations deserve attention: The first is rethinking how we use occupational therapy knowledge to act from and in relation to local contexts, viewing people who are marginalised as knowledge and action partners through generative disruption. The second is to revisit what it entails to foster a posture that acknowledges human dignity. Conclusion: Generative disruption includes a continuous and unabashed critical reflection of and on the limits of our practice and knowledge at hand. It means that we need to include service users and community partners in taking necessary steps to render services in local contexts most needed in recalibration toward social and occupational justice. In our knowledge-making partnerships, it is also imperative to revisit the posture of acknowledging human dignity.","output":"Re-orienting occupational therapy: Embracing generative disruption and revisiting a posture that acknowledges human dignity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: \\"The United States may be facing the most severe housing crisis in its history According to the latest analysis of weekly U S Census data, as federal, state and local protections and resources expire and in the absence of robust and swift intervention, an estimated 30-40 million people in America could be at risk of eviction in the next several months Many property owners, who lack the credit or financial ability to cover rental payment arrears, will struggle to pay their mortgages and property taxes, and maintain properties The COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] housing crisis has sharply increased the risk of foreclosure and bankruptcy, especially among small property owners;long-term harm to renter families and individuals;disruption of the affordable housing market;and destabilization of communities across the United States \\"","output":"COVID-19 Eviction Crisis: An Estimated 30-40 Million People in America Are at Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020, authorities have used temporary ad-hoc policy measures, such as lockdowns and mass quarantines, to slow its transmission. However, the consequences of widespread use of these unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the understanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures, we therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large number of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy intervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy intervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is growing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most severe measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently spread. The intensity of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the strongly concave relationship that we identify between production shortfall and infection rate reductions. Our experiments further suggest that the intervention should last until after the peak established by the reduced infection rate, which implies that stricter policies should last longer. The model and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy experiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses in the face of a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.","output":"COVID-19 and Global Economic Growth: Policy Simulations with a Pandemic-Enabled Neoclassical Growth Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Elevated D-dimer is a predictor of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, and heparin use during in-hospital stay has been associated with decreased mortality COVID-19 patient autopsies have revealed thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting that hypercoagulability is a prominent feature of organ failure in these patients Interestingly, in COVID-19, pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia corroborating the hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of respiratory failure Methods: We describe a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Sirio-Libanes Hospital in S?o Paulo-Brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses tailored to clinical severity Results: PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased significantly over the 72 h following the start of anticoagulation, from 254(90) to 325(80), p = 0 013, and 92% of the patients were discharged home within a median time of 11 days There were no bleeding complications or fatal events Discussion: Even though this uncontrolled case series does not offer absolute proof that micro thrombosis in the pulmonary circulation is the underlying mechanism of respiratory failure in COVID-19, patients positive response to heparinization contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease and provides valuable information for the treatment of these patients while we await the results of further prospective controlled studies ?

DESIGN: Randomised, open label trial. SETTING: Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34%) who did not receive tocilizumab.

The objective of the present study was to determine the nutritional immunity information-seeking behaviour during COVID-19 in India. DESIGN: Google Trends (GTs) data on relevant COVID-19 and nutritional topics were systematically selected and retrieved. Data on newly reported COVID-19 cases were also examined on a daily basis. The cross-correlation method was used to determine the correlation coefficient between the selected terms and daily new COVID-19 cases, and the joinpoint regression models were utilised to measure monthly percent change (MPC) in relative search volumes (RSV). SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: People using Google search during the period 1 January 2020C31 August 2020 in India. RESULTS: The date of peak searches can be attributed to the COVID-19 guidelines announcement dates. All the nutritional terms showed a significant increase in average monthly percentage change. The higher than the average daily rise in COVID-19 cases leads to a higher than average increase in RSV of nutritional terms with the greatest association after 14C27 d. The highest mean relative search volume for nutritional terms was from Southern India (4934  743), and the lowest was from Western India (3110  630).

METHODS A 2-part questionnaire, which included modified stress and anxiety inventories, was disseminated electronically to U.S. orthodontic residents between June and July 2020. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Overall, 261 participants responded (56% female), representing a response rate of 26.8%. Significant gender differences were found in 18 stress items, with female respondents expressing more stress than their male counterparts. Only 1 stress item (ie, fear of being unable to catch up if behind) varied as a function of the difference on the basis of respondents' stage in the program. First-year residents reported more stress in relation to this than more senior residents. Responses to all anxiety items but 1 item varied by gender, with females reporting higher scores.

However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), despite the benefits of regular exercise being well documented (Radtke et al, 2017), there is limited uptake. Concerns regarding infection control, lack of CF education, and participating with an older age group may be contributing factors. A pilot study demonstrated good clinical benefits to participants in a CF-specific PR program (Bowen et al, 2019) and current CF Foundation guidelines advise that patients with advanced lung disease should be offered such programs (Kapnadak et al, 2020). We aimed to establish a CF-specific PR program at Manchester Adult CF Centre, as part of the CF Trust Physiotherapy Fellowship service development project. Method: Patients completed a bespoke 8-week program, comprised of biweekly 1:1 virtual exercise sessions. Each session included aerobic and strength training linked to patient goals and was progressed according to reported Borg and muscle fatigue scores. A 1-minute sit to stand test (STS) was performed pre-program and repeated at the end. Enrolled patients had access to an online educational website, which covered a range of CF-specific topics. Patient feedback was collected at the end of the program. Results: [Table Preseteed] Patient feedback indicated that 100% of participants felt their goals had been met and that they would recommend the program to other people with CF (PWCF).

Xenowar is the Clausewitzian trinity spun in recursive loops of alterity, where conflict diagonalizes into an inhuman, alien cognition. War persists, but Clausewitzs wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit morphs to become topological. Combatants emerge from corporations and nations as the understanding of war as human activity evolves into the realisation that all human activity is now war.

Topological equivalence will mean the continuous mapping of States within Stack homeomorphism via oscillations of stretching and contraction. Westphalian deformations will increase turbulence at higher manifolds and dimensions. Equally, an inability to cut and paste borders of Stack topology will accentuate disconnection.

Here, we reported effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the mood of general public and ascertained impacts of psychosocial factors on the plague-related emotional measures. METHODS: During Feb. 4-6, 2020, a self-reported questionnaire Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was disseminated to general public via Wechat, along with a sociodemographic information sheet. BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety in subgroups of respondents were compared. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were done for correlation analysis and to identify factors predictive of anxiety. RESULTS: Averaged BAI score of all respondents is higher than those of general public in two previous studies. The people quarantined for probable COVID-19 infection presented higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety relative to non-quarantined respondents. People in high epidemic area showed higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety compared to those in low epidemic area. Significant associations existed between anxiety level of the respondents and each of the investigated factors, except for gender. Quarantine was the predictor with a highest OR, followed by divorced/widow. The other factors showed smaller but significant effects on the anxiety level of respondents. LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional study was unable to track the emotional changes in the respondents over time. It had a relatively small sample and involved some of emotional measures only.

We have observed an increase in vertigo consultations during this period, mainly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Objective: To determine the impact of preventive lockdown on the prevalence and characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Methods: We did a retrospective study. All patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo during July and August 2020 who visited the clinic in Red de Salud UC Christus, Santiago, Chile, were included. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, need for repositioning maneuvers, and medical history was compared with patients seen in July and August 2019. Cases secondary to trauma and with incomplete records were excluded. Results: During July and August 2020, 99 patients consulted with a medical history compatible with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, average age 54.5 years, 68.9% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 40.2% of cases. Of 28 patients with vitamin D levels, 27 showed deficiency/insufficiency. In 2019, for July and August, 54 patients were seen in the clinic with an average age of 61.7 years, and 83.3% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 79.6%, and of the nine patients with vitamin D levels, seven presented deficiency/insufficiency. Statistically significant differences were observed regarding age, sex, and need for repositioning maneuvers.

Clinical testing alone provides a snapshot of infected individuals but is costly and difficult to perform logistically across whole populations.

SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in high concentrations (>10(7) genomic copies/mL) due to its ability to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of humans through attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors there. Monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, alongside clinical testing, can more accurately represent the spread of disease within a community. This protocol describes a reliable and efficacious method to recover SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, quantify genomic RNA levels, and evaluate concentration fluctuations over time. Using this protocol, viral levels as low as 10 genomic copies/mL were successfully detected from 30 mL of wastewater in more than seven-hundred samples collected between August 2020 and March 2021.

To support decision making about hospital admission, we aimed to develop a simple and valid model for predicting mortality and need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in suspected-COVID-19 patients presenting at the ED. Methods: For model development, we included patients that presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 large Dutch hospitals with suspected COVID-19 between March and August 2020, the first wave of the pandemic in the Netherlands. Based on prior literature we included patient characteristics, vital parameters and blood test values, all measured at ED admission, as potential predictors. Logistic regression analyses with post-hoc uniform shrinkage was used to obtain predicted probabilities of in-hospital death and of being admitted to the ICU, both within 28 days after admission. Model performance (AUC; calibration plots, intercepts and slopes) was assessed with temporal validation in patients who presented between September and December 2020 (second wave). We used multiple imputation to account for missing predictor values. Results: The development data included 5,831 patients who presented at the ED and were hospitalized, of whom 629 (10.8%) died and 5,070 (86.9%) were discharged within 28 days after admission. A simple model -- named COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE) -- with linear age and logarithmic transforms of respiratory rate, CRP, LDH, albumin and urea captured most of the ability to predict death within 28 days. Patients who were admitted in the first month of the pandemic had substantially increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.61-2.47). COPE was well-calibrated and showed good discrimination for predicting death in 3,252 patients of the second wave (AUC in 4 hospitals: 0.82; 0.82; 0.79; 0.83). COPE was also able to identify patients at high risk of needing IC in second wave patients below the age of 70 (AUC 0.84; 0.81), but overestimated ICU admission for low-risk patients. The models are implemented as a web-based application. Conclusion: COPE is a simple tool that is well able to predict mortality and ICU admission for patients who present to the ED with suspected COVID-19 and may help to inform patients and doctors when deciding on hospital admission.","output":"COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 propelled telehealth to the forefront of health care, forcing many advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to incorporate telehealth into their practice without sufficient education.

It is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The ability to gain quick control of the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, mainly in relation to viral biology and host immune response. The rapid clinical course seen in COVID-19 indicates that infection control in asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease is probably due to the innate immune response, as, considering that SARS-CoV-2 is new to humans, an effective adaptive response would not be expected to occur until approximately 2-3 weeks after contact with the virus. Antiviral innate immunity has humoral components (complement and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems, soluble proteins that recognize glycans on cell surface, interferons, chemokines, and naturally occurring antibodies) and cellular components (natural killer cells and other innate lymphocytes). Failure of this system would pave the way for uncontrolled viral replication in the airways and the mounting of an adaptive immune response, potentially amplified by an inflammatory cascade. Severe COVID-19 appears to be due not only to viral infection but also to a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response. In this paper, the authors review the most recent publications on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, virus interactions with target cells, and host immune responses, and highlight possible associations between deficient innate and acquired immune responses and disease progression and mortality.

Given the great potential of this phase as a therapeutic window for immunotherapies because of its association with immunoregulatory mechanisms and -cell protection, our objective was to find peripheral immunological biomarkers for its better characterization, monitoring, and prediction. The longitudinal follow-up of 17 pediatric patients with new-onset T1D over one year revealed that, during the PR phase, remitter patients show increased percentages of effector memory (EM) T lymphocytes, terminally differentiated EM T lymphocytes, and neutrophils in comparison to non-remitter patients. On the contrary, remitter patients showed lower percentages of na?ve T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (T(REG)), and dendritic cells (DCs). After a year of follow-up, these patients also presented increased levels of regulatory B cells and transitional T1 B lymphocytes. On the other hand, although none of the analyzed cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, TGF-1, IL-17A, and IL-10) could distinguish or predict remission, IL-17A was increased at T1D diagnosis in comparison to control subjects, and remitter patients tended to maintain lower levels of this cytokine than non-remitters. Therefore, these potential monitoring immunological biomarkers of PR support that this stage is governed by both metabolic and immunological factors and suggest immunoregulatory attempts during this phase. Furthermore, since the percentage of T(REG), monocytes, and DCs, and the total daily insulin dose at diagnosis were found to be predictors of the PR phase, we next created an index-based predictive model comprising those immune cell percentages that could potentially predict remission at T1D onset. Although our preliminary study needs further validation, these candidate biomarkers could be useful for the immunological characterization of the PR phase, the stratification of patients with better disease prognosis, and a more personalized therapeutic management.","output":"Candidate Biomarkers for the Prediction and Monitoring of Partial Remission in Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors regret that an error was made in the third paragraph of the article.

SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS People with MCI or dementia, confirmed through validated assessment measures. Any form of physical activity/exercise was included. As controls, we included participants not following any prespecified physical activity/exercise intervention or following the same standard protocol with the intervention group. METHODS The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CDR 164197). Major databases were searched until December 31, 2019. The certainty of evidence of statistically significant outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. SRs' findings, without a formal MA, were reported descriptively. RESULTS Among 1160 articles initially evaluated, 27 SRs (all of RCTs, 9 without MA) for a total of 28,205 participants with MCI/dementia were included. In patients with MCI, mind-body intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.36; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.20-0.52; low certainty) and mixed physical activity interventions (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI 0.11-0.49; moderate certainty) had a small effect on global cognition, whereas resistance training (SMD = 0.80; 95% CI 0.29-1.31; very low certainty) had a large effect on global cognition.

The standard technique for CVP measurement is invasive, requiring the insertion of a catheter into a jugular vein, with potential complications. On the other hand, the current non-invasive methods, mainly based on ultrasounds, remain operator-dependent and are unsuitable for use in the home environment. In this paper, we will introduce a novel, non-invasive device for the hospital, office and home assessment of CVP. METHODS: After describing the measurement concept, we will report a preliminary experimental study enrolling 5 voluntary healthy subjects to evaluate the VenCoM measurements repeatability, and the systems capability in measuring small elicited venous pressure variations (2 mmHg), as well as an induced venous hypertension within a pathological range (1220 mmHg). RESULTS: The experimental measurements showed a repeatability of 1mmHg. The VenCoM device was able to reliably detect the elicited venous pressure variations and the simulated congestive status. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The proposed non-invasive VenCoM device is able to provide a fast and repeatable CVP estimate, having a wide spectrum of potential clinical applications, including the monitoring of venous congestion in heart failure patients and in subjects with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as pulmonary hypertension (PH) that can be extended to pneumonia COVID-19 patients even after recovery.

This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID-19 induced lung pathophysiology. Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 (CARDS) seems to present as two distinct phenotypes: Type-L and Type-H. The 'L' refers to Low elastance, ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the 'H' refers to High pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability. However, the LUNG SAFE and ESICM Trials Groups has shown that ~13% of the mechanically ventilated non-COVID-19 ARDS patients have the Type-L phenotype. However, other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients. The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of: 1) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation, 2) thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3) endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) perfusion control, and 4) hyper-perfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model. A flow chart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which recently was shown effective at improving oxygenation and reducing FiO2, vasopressors, and sedation in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Functional Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 Induced Acute Lung Injury and Clinical Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: Identificar a proporo de idosos n?o vacinados e os motivos que interferem na imunizao contra a influenza em localidades rurais ribeirinhas e potenciais implicaes na vacinao contra COVID-19.

However, this has been poorly characterized in apicomplexans, a major phylum of some of the most important global parasites. Efforts have been hampered by atypical transcriptomic features, such as the high AU content of Plasmodium RNA, but also the limitations of short-read sequencing in deciphering complex splicing events. In this study, we utilized the long read direct RNA sequencing platform developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies to survey the alternative splicing landscape of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. We find that while native RNA sequencing has a reduced throughput, it allows us to obtain full-length or nearly full-length transcripts with comparable quantification to Illumina sequencing. By comparing these data with available gene models, we find widespread alternative splicing, particularly intron retention, in these parasites. Most of these transcripts contain premature stop codons, suggesting that in these parasites, alternative splicing represents a pathway to transcriptomic diversity, rather than expanding proteomic diversity. Moreover, alternative splicing rates are comparable between parasites, suggesting a shared splicing machinery, despite notable transcriptomic differences between the parasites. This study highlights a strategy in using long-read sequencing to understand splicing events at the whole-transcript level and has implications in the future interpretation of transcriptome sequencing studies. IMPORTANCE We have used a novel nanopore sequencing technology to directly analyze parasite transcriptomes. The very long reads of this technology reveal the full-length genes of the parasites that cause malaria and toxoplasmosis. Gene transcripts must be processed in a process called splicing before they can be translated to protein. Our analysis reveals that these parasites very frequently only partially process their gene products, in a manner that departs dramatically from their human hosts.","output":"Direct Nanopore Sequencing of mRNA Reveals Landscape of Transcript Isoforms in Apicomplexan Parasites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the line dividing human and wild habitats becomes thinner, we might be brewing the world's next big pandemic.

This disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, and on March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Today, more than 9 million people have been infected, with more than 470,000 casualties. Today, no vaccine or antiviral drug is available. While the development of a vaccine might take at least a year, and for a novel drug, even longer; finding a new use to an old drug (drug repurposing) could be the most effective strategy. We present a docking-based screening using a quantum mechanical scoring of a library built from approved drugs and compounds undergoing clinical trials, against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: the spike or S-protein, and two proteases, the main protease and the papain-like protease. The S-protein binds directly to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor of the human host cell surface, while the two proteases process viral polyproteins. Following the analysis of our structure-based compound screening, we propose several structurally diverse compounds (either FDA-approved or in clinical trials) that could display antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, these compounds should be further evaluated in experimental assays and clinical trials to confirm their actual activity against the disease.

Methods: Ninety (73.3% female; age 32.04  11.33) individuals participated in this study. Qualifying participants answered questions using an online survey regarding their loneliness, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, mood state, and physical activity over four time points each lasting two weeks. Results: Symptoms of depression and state anxiety were increased in the population when compared to nationwide statistics from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Time point 2, ~1 month into social isolation, showed the most significant effects on mental health. During this time point, 100% of the participants showed symptoms of depression. There were no significant changes in physical activity over the 8 weeks. Loneliness, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and mood state were negatively associated with participation in physical activity. Vigor and state anxiety were associated with participation in physical activity. Conclusion: Social isolation and social distancing practices have had a negative effect on depression, anxiety, and mood over time. It appeared that depressive symptoms and total mood disturbance was elevated during time point two. Depressive symptoms were much higher than average compared to previous epidemiological data.

METHODS: A systematic review using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar has been conducted. In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, the articles published in the period January 1, 2020, to April 2, 2020, written in English and reporting clinical symptoms of COVID-19 was reviewed. To assess, the presence of heterogeneity, the Cochrans Q statistic, the I(2) index, and the tau-squared test were used. Because of significant heterogeneity between the studies the random-effects model with 95% CI was used to calculate the pooled estimation of each symptom prevalence. RESULTS: The most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients include: Fever 81.2% (95% CI: 77.9-84.4); Cough: 58.5% (95% CI: 54.2-62.8); Fatigue 38.5% (95% CI: 30.6-45.3); Dyspnea: 26.1% (95% CI: 20.4-31.8); and the Sputum: 25.8% (95% CI: 21.1-30.4).

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on 103 elderly patients with post-stroke aspiration pneumonia and moderate respiratory failure (oxygenation index: 100C200 mmHg) that had been admitted. The patients were divided into two groups according to the mode of oxygen therapy that was used: the Venturi mask group and the HFNC treatment group. The two groups were analyzed and compared in terms of the changes in the blood gas indices measured at different points in time (4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h), the proportion of patients that required transition to invasive auxiliary ventilation, and the 28-day mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were retrospectively analyzed; 16 cases were excluded, and 87 patients were included in the final patient group (42 in the HFNC group and 45 in the Venturi group). There was a statistically significant difference in the oxygenation indices of the HFNC group and the Venturi group (F = 546.811, P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant interaction between the monitored oxygenation indices and the mode of oxygen therapy (F = 70.961, P < 0.05), and there was a statistically significant difference in the oxygenation indices for the two modes of oxygen therapy (F = 256.977, P < 0.05).

Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures.

International guidelines recommend expectant management, along with antenatal steroids before 34 weeks and antibiotics. Up-to-date evidence about the risks and benefits of administering tocolysis after PPROM, however, is lacking. In theory, reducing uterine contractility could delay delivery and reduce the risks of prematurity and its adverse short- and long-term consequences, but it might also prolong fetal exposure to inflammation, infection, and acute obstetric complications, potentially associated with neonatal death or long-term sequelae. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether short-term (48 h) tocolysis reduces perinatal mortality/morbidity in PPROM at 22 to 33 completed weeks of gestation. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial will be performed in 29 French maternity units. Women with PPROM between 22(0/7) and 33(6/7) weeks of gestation, a singleton pregnancy, and no condition contraindicating expectant management will be randomized to receive a 48-hour oral treatment by either nifedipine or placebo (1:1 ratio). The primary outcome will be the occurrence of perinatal mortality/morbidity, a composite outcome including fetal death, neonatal death, or severe neonatal morbidity before discharge. If we assume an alpha-risk of 0.05 and beta-risk of 0.20 (i.e., a statistical power of 80%), 702 women (351 per arm) are required to show a reduction of the primary endpoint from 35% (placebo group) to 25% (nifedipine group).

Those responding yes were asked if they intended to use the respective space. We estimated the weighted prevalence of adults who observed new places and changed spaces, and their intended use, by sociodemographic and geographic characteristics, physical activity level, and walking status. We compared subgroups with prevalence ratios (PR). Overall, 25.0% of US adults reported discovering new places for physical activity, and 25.3% reported changes to streets and outdoor spaces. Intention to use new places and changed spaces exceeded 50% among all sociodemographic and geographic subgroups. Among those reporting changes, adults who were physically inactive compared to those who were sufficiently active had similar intentions to use new places (PR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.63, 1.10) and changed spaces (PR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.69, 1.17). Approximately 1 in 4 adults reported discovering new places or changed spaces to support physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most intended to use these features. Expanding access to such supportive environments may help promote physical activity participation.","output":"Observation of and intention to use new places and changed spaces for physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic  United States, June 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aptamers are short fragments of nucleic acids, DNA or RNA that have the ability to bind selected proteins with high specificity and affinity. These properties allow them to be used as an element of biosensors for the detection of specific proteins, including viral ones, which makes it possible to design valuable diagnostic tools. The influenza virus causes a huge number of human and animal deaths worldwide every year, and contributes to remarkable economic losses. In addition, in 2020, a new threat appeared-the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Both disease entities, especially in the initial stage of infection, are almost identical in terms of signs and symptoms. Therefore, a diagnostic solution is needed that will allow distinguishing between both pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity; it should be cheap, quick and possible to use in the field, for example, in a doctor's office. All the mentioned properties are met by aptasensors in which the detection elements are specific aptamers. We present here the latest developments in the construction of various types of aptasensors for the detection of influenza virus. Aptasensor operation is based on the measurement of changes in electric impedance, fluorescence or electric signal (impedimetric, fluorescence and electrochemical aptasensors, respectively); it allows both qualitative and quantitative determinations. The particularly high advancement for detecting of influenza virus concerns impedimetric aptasensors.","output":"The Latest Achievements in the Construction of Influenza Virus Detection Aptasensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current practice for diagnosis of COVID-19, based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk, likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection.

Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein.

A much-needed step. The assaults on doctors have been happening in hospitals in India for a long time. This review article traces the journey of the Prevention of the Doctors Violence Act and suggests a way forward with regard to violence on the doctors and why there must be a permanent solution for the same. Methodology is based on a detailed study across a range of published literature in journals, articles, and other online sources. An extensive review has been undertaken of these articles based on an explanatory approach. The review provided insight into the current status of violence against doctors. Most of the initiatives on prevention of violence against doctors mentioned in the studies are mainly directed towards patient-doctor relationship, lack of infrastructure, strenuous working environment, and societal obligations. Study findings revealed that there was less emphasis on the current legal measures available and its implementation. This article highlights the critical aspect of protection of the health care workforce and also shares recommendations to enhance the protection of doctors at their workplace by sharing the current state-level legal measures available and advocates the impelling need for central legislation.

It is responsible for various clinical symptoms, including hyposmia and other neurological ones. Current literature suggests the olfactory mucosa as a port of entry to the CNS, but how the virus reaches the olfactory groove is still unknown. Because the first neurological symptoms of invasion (hyposmia) do not correspond to first signs of infection, the hypothesis of direct contact through airborne droplets during primary infection and therefore during inspiration is not plausible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a secondary spread to the olfactory groove in a retrograde manner during expiration could be more probable. Methods: Four three-dimensional virtual models were obtained from actual CT scans and used to simulate expiratory droplets. The volume mesh consists of 25 million of cells, the simulated condition is a steady expiration, driving a flow rate of 270 ml/s, for a duration of 0.6 seconds. The droplet diameter is of 5 m. Results: The analysis of the simulations shows the virus to have a high probability to be deployed in the rhinopharynx, on the tail of medium and upper turbinates. The possibility for droplets to access the olfactory mucosa during the expiratory phase is lower than other nasal areas, but consistent. Discussion: The data obtained from these simulations demonstrates the virus can be deployed in the olfactory groove during expiration. Even if the total amount in a single act is scarce, it must be considered it is repeated tens of thousands of times a day, and the source of contamination continuously acts on a timescale of several days. The present results also imply CNS penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through olfactory mucosa might be considered a complication and, consequently, prevention strategies should be considered in diseased patients.","output":"Through The Back Door: Expiratory Accumulation of SARS-Cov-2 in the Olfactory Mucosa as Mechanism for CNS Penetration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of ongoing efforts by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to enhance disease surveillance, a retrospective epidemiologic study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness for influenza surveillance of data on changes in the volume of prescriptions for antiviral medications.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 386 patients who underwent LSG between December 2009 and January 2015. 352 (91.2%) of the patient were followed up for at least 24 months. In the first 206 patients, the fascial layers of the trocar incisions were not closed, while in the next 146 cases, routine closure of the trocar sites was performed. The patients were reviewed in relation to demographics, comorbidities, complications, percentage of excess weight loss, and rates of PSH. The total cohort consisted of 220 female and 132 male patients with a mean age of 36.2  12.3 years. Demographic data, initial BMI, and comorbidities were similar for the patients in both groups. The closure of the fascia was caused by the prolonged duration of the operation with no significant difference. The unclosed fascial defects were associated with a significantly increased incidence of PSH (1.3 vs. 3.9%, p < 0.05). All of the patients who experienced PSH had at least one comorbidity, and no complication was noted in the fascial closure cases. It was found that the rate of PSH after LSG is not as low as previously thought, and that routine closure of fascial defects at port sites may result in a decreased PSH rate.","output":"Port site hernia after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a retrospective cohort study of 352 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During subintimal angioplasty (SIA), it is not always possible to re-enter the vessel lumen due to a variety of factors. Recanalization using hydrophilic wires and catheters alone, apart from its potential technical failure, is also limited by minimal control over the re-entry point. This is frequently well beyond the point of occlusion, thus often compromising important collaterals. In order to bypass the obstruction and attain controlled re-entry into the lumen of the diseased vessel, a re-entry device (RED) may be required. This paper assesses our centres experience with the safety and efficacy of the Pioneer re-entry system and systematically reviews the pertinent literature. METHOD: A single centre retrospective study of subintimal angioplasty involving the use of the Pioneer Plus intravascular guided reentry catheter was performed. Patient demographics including age, gender, risk factors, comorbidities clinical indication and complications were recorded. Lesion characteristics, including location and severity of calcification were also assessed. A systematic literature review of all reported studies where the Pioneer RED was used for iliac and lower limb revascularization was conducted by 2 of the authors using the PubMed (MEDLINE) and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: The study comprised 30 cases. Technical success was 97%. A small, quickly resolved extravasation was the only device related complication. These results are in line with the systematic review which identified 16 studies using the Pioneer RED, reporting a technical success rate of 87.4C100% (median = 100%) and complication rate of 0C25.8% (median = 0%).

The disease led to significant mortality and morbidity in Turkey, since the first case was reported on March 11th, 2020. Studies suggest a positive association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ambient particulate matters (PM), as potential carriers for SARS-CoV-2. Ambient PM samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban and urban-background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities across Turkey between 13th of May and 14th of June 2020 to investigate the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. A total of 203 daily samples (TSP, n = 80; PM2.5, n = 33; PM2.5-10, n = 23; PM10m, n = 19; and 6 size segregated PM, n = 48) were collected using various samplers. The N1 gene and RdRP gene expressions were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to real time (RT)-PCR and three-dimensional (3D) digital (d) PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 (9.8%) samples. Ambient PM-bound SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed quantitatively and the air concentrations of the virus ranged from 0.1 copies/m3 to 23 copies/m3. The highest percentages of virus detection on PM samples were from hospital gardens in Tekirdag, Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles, especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots.

These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site.

Past evidence from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks provided hints about the role of enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this setting, ACE-2 is an enzyme of great importance since it is the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data elucidate patterns of enzymatic alterations in COVID-19, which could be associated with organ damage, prognosis, and clinical complications. Further, viral mutations can create new disease behaviors, and these effects are related to the activity of enzymes.

Microglial activation has become increasingly recognized as a key process regulating the pathology of white matter in a wide range of brain injury and disease contexts. As white matter damage is known to be a major contributor to the impairments that follow mTBI, microglia have rightfully become a common target of investigation for the development of mTBI therapies and biomarkers. Recent work has demonstrated that the efficacy of microglial manipulation as a therapeutic intervention following injury or disease is highly time-sensitive, emphasizing the importance of advancing our understanding of the dynamics of post-mTBI microglial activation from onset to resolution. Current reporting of microglial activation in experimental studies of mTBI is non-standardized, which has limited our ability to identify concrete patterns of post-mTBI microglial activation over time. In this review, we examine preclinical studies of mTBI that report on microglial activation in white matter regions to summarize our current understanding of these patterns. Specifically, we summarize timecourses of post-mTBI microglial activation in white matter regions of the brain, identify factors that influence this activation, examine the temporal relationship between microglial activation and other post-mTBI assessments, and compare the relative sensitivities of various methods for detecting microglial activation. While the lack of replicated experimental conditions has limited the extent of conclusions that can confidently be drawn, we find that microglia are activated over a wide range of timecourses following mTBI and that microglial activation is a long-lasting outcome of mTBI that may resolve after most typical post-mTBI assessments, with the exception of those measuring oligodendrocyte lineage cell integrity. We identify several understudied parameters of post-mTBI microglial activation in white matter, such as the inclusion of female subjects.

Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown. Objective To evaluate the presence of myocardial injury in unselected patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness. Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective observational cohort study, 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness were identified from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry between April and June 2020. Exposure Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained. Comparisons were made with age-matched and sex-matched control groups of healthy volunteers (n = 50) and risk factor-matched patients (n = 57). Results Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 49 (45-53) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (3 pg/mL or greater) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (13.9 pg/mL or greater) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, higher left ventricle mass, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), and pericardial enhancement (n = 22). There was a small but significant difference between patients who recovered at home vs in the hospital for native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1122 [1113-1132] ms vs 1143 [1131-1156] ms; P = .02) but not for native T2 mapping or hsTnT levels. None of these measures were correlated with time from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P = .47; native T2: r = 0.14; P = .15; hsTnT: r = -0.07; P = .50). High-sensitivity troponin T was significantly correlated with native T1 mapping (r = 0.35; P < .001) and native T2 mapping (r = 0.22; P = .03). Endomyocardial biopsy in patients with severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1 and T2 were the measures with the best discriminatory ability to detect COVID-19-related myocardial pathology. Conclusions and Relevance In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.

Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of psychological distress, compared to non-users. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of medical use, non-medical use, and BZD use disorders. Compared to non-users of z-drugs, medical users had higher risk of marijuana and alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, while non-medical users had higher risk of marijuana use and marijuana use disorders and alcohol. CONCLUSION Z-drug users have elevated risk of use and dependence of BZDs and recreational drugs, possibly due to concurrent prescribing and self-medication.","output":"How do medical and non-medical use of z-drugs relate to psychological distress and the use of other depressant drugs?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimism about China's rise has in recent years given way to deep concern in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. Drawing on an original set of interviews with China experts from each country, and an array of primary and secondary sources, I show that shifting framings of China's rise reflect the dynamics of the US, Australian and UK national security fields. The article highlights three features specifically: first, the US field features a belief that China's rise can be arrested or prevented, absent in Australia and the UK. I root this dynamic in the system of professional appointments and the intense US 'marketplace of ideas', which gives rise to intense framing contestation and occasional sharp frame change. I then identify the key positions produced by each field, from which key actors have shaped the differing interpretations of China and its meaning. The election of Donald Trump, a strong China-critic, to the US presidency empowered key individuals across government who shifted the predominant framing of China from potential challenger to current threat. The smaller and more centralized fields in Australia and Britain feature fewer and less intense China-sceptical voices;responses have thereby remained largely pragmatic, despite worsening diplomatic relations in each case.","output":"Framing China's rise in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome-coronavirus (SADS-CoV) are three emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses (CoVs). Symptoms caused by these three viruses are extremely similar, including acute diarrhea, vomiting and even death in piglets. To date, strict biosecurity is still the most effective disease prevention and control measures, and the early detection of pathogens is the most important link. Here, we developed a microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system for the first time, which could detected PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV simultaneously, and had advantages of rapid, simple, sensitive, high-throughput, and accurate at point-of-care settings. The lowest detection limits of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip method are 101 copies/L, 102 copies/L and 102 copies/L for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively. The whole detection procedure can be finished rapidly in 40 min without any cross-reaction with other common swine viruses. A total of 173 clinical swine fecal samples characterized with diarrheal symptoms were used to evaluate the performance of the newly developed system, which presented good stabilities (C.V.s<5%) and specificities (100%), and possessed sensitivities of 92.24%, 92.19% and 91.23% for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV respectively.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients who develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have dismal prognosis with approximately 20% mortality. Given the lack of a specific and effective therapy, the availability of various vaccination platforms against SARS-CV-2 has generated optimism towards the development of a robust herd immunity. Notwithstanding the prioritization of HCT recipients to COVID-19 vaccination, limited information is available on whether and to what extent, they mount an immune response to SARS-CV-2 vaccination as they were generally excluded from vaccination trials. Aim. To gain insights in the immune responses developed to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under immunosuppression, we studied the humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in HCT recipients. Methods. We prospectively studied (April-July 2021), adult patients who had undergone HCT in our Unit and received two doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (as per international guidelines) after providing written informed consent. Responses were studied before each vaccination dose and 12-51 days later after the second dose. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2-NAbs) were measured using an FDA approved methodology for diagnostic use (ELISA, cPass? SARS-CoV-2 NAbs Detection Kit; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA; cut-off value for a positive result set at 30%) and SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells (spike-STs) by interferon- Elispot after pulsing peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike pepmixes. Results. Humoral responses were studied on 65 patients, (50 allo-HCT/15 auto-HCT, Figure A). T cell responses were measured on 38/65 vaccinated patients (32 allo-HCT/6 auto-HCT) with a median of 3 (0.17-31) and 2 years (1.25-8) post allo- and auto-HCT respectively, and 19 healthy, unexposed vaccinees. One patient with prior COVID-19, was excluded from analysis. All patients were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech, except for 2 vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Both CoV-2-NAbs and spike-STs were barely detectable before vaccination but could be detected in both allo- and auto-HCT patients after the first vaccination dose, reaching statistically significant increase after the second vaccination dose (p<0.001 and p=0.036, respectively). Circulating spike-STs in allo-HCT recipients, although present, were lower over their counterparts in healthy volunteers (p<0.001) and auto-HCT patients (p=0.080). In the latter patient cohort, the rather long period post auto-HCT (1.25 years for all patients) might have generated unintended bias towards elevated immune responses. The longer time post HCT in all patients was associated with increased CoV-2-NAbs and spike-STs (p=0.004 and p=0.030). Allo-HCT recipients under immunosuppression had lower levels of CoV-2-NAbs and spike-STs after the booster dose compared to patients off-treatment (Figure B and C, p<0.001 and p=0.021 respectively). In particular, only 50% and 40% of patients on systemic immunosuppression reached adequate CoV-2-Nab and spike-ST levels after the second dose, as compared to 98% and 94% of immunosuppression-free patients. One allo-HCT recipient with failure to mount any immune response post booster vaccination, developed 40 days later COVID-19 infection and succumbed. The one allo-HCT recipient off treatment who did not elicit protective immune response after vaccination, was suffering from metabolic syndrome, a potentially immunosuppressive entity. Overall, there was a good correlation between humoral and T-cellular responses (p=0.013), although few cases were observed with sufficient T-cell response but no humoral reactivity and vice versa. Conclusion . Herein, we report for first time humoral and T cell responses post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in HCT recipients. Transplant recipients not under active and intense immunosuppression at the time of vaccination may benefit significantly from COVID-19 vaccination even though these responses are blunted compared to healthy individuals. However, for the severely immunocompromised patients it seems highly unlikely that they could be protected by vaccination and for this vulnerable population, different vaccination schemes or therapeutic platforms should be developed along with collateral measures including minimal exposure and immunization of caregivers and health care providers.

We demonstrate how empathic engagement by institutional entrepreneurs can nurture communities of practice that co-create change in institutional fields. Our argument hinges on the actors affective investment and advances the less developed non-cognitive dimension of institutional work. By integrating empathic engagement into institutional entrepreneurship, we demonstrate how institutional entrepreneurs nurture their ability to engage and cooperate with others to diffuse particular values through institutional work. This integration focuses on the way of knowing generated through empathic engagement: the ability to bring about a consensus by creating frames of reference and identities that others are enchanted by and subscribe to, as opposed to using coercive mechanisms.","output":"Institutional work through empathic engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O hambrguer  um produto industrializado de origem animal, extremamente utilizado pela populao principalmente pela sua praticidade no consumo.

Simulation is one approach used for understanding and assessing the likely impact of changes to the delivery of health services. However, little is known about the usefulness of simulation for analysing the delivery of sexual health services (SHSs). We propose a simulation method to model and evaluate patient flows and resource use within an SHS to inform service redesign. METHODS We developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to identify the bottlenecks within the Unity SHS (Bristol, UK) and find possible routes for service improvement. Using the example of the introduction of an online service for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients, the impact on patient waiting times was examined as the main outcome measure. The model included data such as patient arrival time, staff availability and duration of consultation, examination and treatment. We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in the model parameters. RESULTS We identified some bottlenecks under the current system, particularly in the consultation and treatment queues for male and female walk-in patients. Introducing the provision of STI and HIV self-sampling alongside existing services decreased the average waiting time (88 vs 128 min) for all patients and reduced the cost of staff time for managing each patient (72.64 vs 88.74) compared with the current system without online-based self-sampling. CONCLUSIONS The provision of online-based STI and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients could be beneficial in reducing patient waiting times and the model highlights the complexities of using this to cut costs. Attributing recognition for any improvement requires care, but DES modelling can provide valuable insights into the design of SHSs ensuing in quantifiable improvements. Extension of this method with the collection of additional data and the construction of more informed models seems worthwhile.","output":"Modelling patient flows and resource use within a sexual health clinic through discrete event simulation to inform service redesign."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This review set out to summarise, define, and provide future direction towards the use of performance outcome measures as endpoints in research performed at international benchmark events in athletics.

The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is still unclear. Except for the initial status and the imported cases, the isolation measures and the medical treatments of the infected patients have essential influences on the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission involving the interactive effect of various factors for the infected people, including imported cases, isolating rate, diagnostic rate, recovery rate and also the mortality rate. Under the assumption that the random incubation period, the cure period and the diagnosis period are subject to the Weibull distribution, the quantity of daily existing infected people is finally governed by a linear integral-differential equation with convolution kernel. Based on the asymptotic behavior and the quantitative analysis on the model, we rigorously prove that, for limited external input patients, both the quantity of infected patients and its variation ratio will finally tend to zero, if the infected patients are sufficiently isolated or the infection rate is small enough. Finally, numerical performances for the proposed model as well as the comparisons between our simulations and the clinical data of the city Wuhan and Italy are demonstrated, showing the validity of our model with suitably specified model parameters.","output":"The dynamical model for COVID-19 with asymptotic analysis and numerical implementations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health inequities arise when the public cannot access and understand health information in an easy, accessible, and understandable way. Evidence supports that health literacy (HL) is a determinant for health outcomes, and when HL is limited this may have a major impact on morbidity as well as mortality. Migrants are known to have limited HL. Therefore, this study aimed to explore comprehensive health literacy (CHL) and electronic health literacy (eHL) among Arabic-speaking migrants in Sweden. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Sweden. A total of 703 persons were invited to participate between February and September 2019. Two questionnaires C the Health Literacy Survey European Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16) and the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) C and questions about self-perceived health and Internet use were distributed in Swedish and Arabic. Various statistical analyses were performed to determine the associations for limited CHL and eHL. RESULTS: A total of 681 respondents were included in the analysis. Of these, 334 (49%) were native Arabic-speaking migrants and 347 (51%) were native Swedish-speaking residents. CHL and eHL differed between the groups. The Arabic speakers had significantly lower mean sum scores in eHL 28.1 (SD 6.1) vs 29.3 (6.2), p = 0.012 and lower proportion of sufficient CHL 125 (38.9%) vs 239 (71.3%), p < 0.001 compared to Swedish speakers. Multiple regression analysis showed on associations between limited CHL and eHL and being Arabic speaking, less Internet use, and not finding the Internet to be important or useful. Furthermore, longer time spent in Sweden was associated with higher levels of CHL among the Arabic speakers, (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91C0.98, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CHL and eHL differ between Arabic-speaking migrants and native Swedish speakers, but also between Arabic speakers who have lived different lengths of time in Sweden. Though it seems that the eHealth literacy is less affected by language spoken, the Internet is suggested to be an appropriate channel for disseminating health information to Arabic-speaking migrants.

Here, we investigated how a decrease in the HA activation pH (an increase in acid stability) influences the properties of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in mammalian hosts. We generated isogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (VN1203) viruses containing either wild-type HA protein (activation pH 6.0) or an HA2-K58I point mutation (K to I at position 58) (activation pH 5.5). The VN1203-HA2-K58I virus had replication kinetics similar to those of wild-type VN1203 in MDCK and normal human bronchial epithelial cells and yet had reduced growth in human alveolar A549 cells, which were found to have a higher endosomal pH than MDCK cells. Wild-type and HA2-K58I viruses promoted similar levels of morbidity and mortality in C57BL/6J mice and ferrets, and neither virus transmitted efficiently to naive contact cage-mate ferrets.

This comparison represents a unique natural experiment, as connectivity between these two cities has increased over the past decade. We found that, whilst summer influenza epidemics in Shenzhen used to peak 1-3 months later than those in Hong Kong, the difference decreased after 2005 (P<0.0001).

The results of the microarray analysis showed that 365 genes on day 3 post-infection (p.i.) and 781 genes on day 5 p.i. were differentially expressed in response to PHEV infection in the cerebral cortex. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in immune system processes, antigen processing and presentation, the Jak-STAT signalling pathway, the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway, Toll-like receptor signalling and apoptosis-related proteases. Significantly downregulated genes were mainly involved in nervous-system development, synaptic transmission, neuron-projection development, the transmission of nerve impulses and negative regulation of glial cell differentiation.

Notably, all of these outbreaks have been linked to suspected zoonotic transmission of bat-borne viruses. Bats-the only flying mammal-display several additional features that are unique among mammals, such as a long lifespan relative to body size, a low rate of tumorigenesis and an exceptional ability to host viruses without presenting clinical disease. Here we discuss the mechanisms that underpin the host defence system and immune tolerance of bats, and their ramifications for human health and disease. Recent studies suggest that 64 million years of adaptive evolution have shaped the host defence system of bats to balance defence and tolerance, which has resulted in a unique ability to act as an ideal reservoir host for viruses. Lessons from the effective host defence of bats would help us to better understand viral evolution and to better predict, prevent and control future viral spillovers. Studying the mechanisms of immune tolerance in bats could lead to new approaches to improving human health.

Furthermore, the previous duration of studies had a significant impact on the students' perceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of experimental skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of the recitations' effectiveness. That is, students in their first academic year show consistently lower scores than more progressed students.

To promote healthy eating, nutrition labels have been mandated to certain foods in many countries. To test how different designs of nutrition labels affect consumer behavior, eye tracking technique has been increasingly used to overcome the limitations of subjective report which are susceptible to different biases and a poor indicator of nutrition label use in reality. In this review, we reviewed 45 eye-tracking studies on nutrition label processing. Besides a summary of eye tracking methodology, we found three emerged topics from these studies: attention capture, nutrition label comprehension and food choice. Overall, updated designs of nutrition labels improve attention capture and nutrition label comprehension, but it does not necessarily lead to healthier food choices. The discrepancy between attention capture and food choice also indicate potential limitation in promoting healthy food choice via the indirect attention route (exposure - attention - nutrition label processing - food choice). Instead, actual food choice may be a consequence of a direct heuristic route and modulated by person-, product- and context-related factors.

This review will evaluate the evidence that BIS monitoring can improve long-term outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce the incidence of awareness with recall in high-risk patients, but a recent study found that anesthetic management directed by an end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration protocol is equally effective, and probably less expensive. Deep anesthesia (BIS < 45) during the intraoperative period is associated with increased postoperative mortality, but this relationship may be an epiphenomenon rather than causal.

Methods: In this qualitative study, through recorded in-depth individual and focal group interviews, gymnasts (n = 16) and martial arts (n = 18) athletes from Brazil and Spain reported their eating practices. Transcripts were analyzed through the Content Analysis method. Results: The main determinants of athletes' eating practices were the quest for a specific body in line with each sports' discipline and cultural food aspects. The everyday eating practices respected the country of origin's food culture; however, some practices, especially aiming at weight loss were similar in both countries and related to the sports discipline. Female Brazilian aesthetics athletes were particularly worried about achieving a thinner body. Martial arts athletes from both countries reported adopting fast weight loss strategies presently or at some point in their sports trajectory. Internal and external pressure to lose weight was a constant factor, especially amongst Brazilians. Conclusions: There is a specific body culture in each sport discipline, which extends beyond country borders. The idealized bodies athletes seek are constructed socially according to their sports. This confers them an identity and promotes beliefs and meanings to foodways. The sports-related eating practices which superimposed national foodways were similar in both countries, suggesting a group identity process, and the existence of a \\"sports discipline's food culture\\".

In addition to established populations in Staten Island we found evidence of A. maculatum in NJ and other NYC boroughs, suggesting current or future establishment is possible. The failure thus far to detect established populations in these areas may be due to inherent difficulties in detecting low density, spatially heterogeneous incipient populations, which could require targeted surveillance efforts for this species.

MethodsThis is a phase 2, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multi-centre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate MVC-COV1901. The study comprised 3,844 participants of [] 20 years who were generally healthy or with stable pre-existing medical conditions. The study participants were randomly assigned in a 6:1 ratio to receive either MVC-COV1901 containing 15 g of S-2P protein or placebo containing saline. Participants received two doses of MVC-COV1901 or placebo, administered 28 days apart via intramuscular injection. The primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 from Day 1 (the day of first vaccination) to Day 57 (28 days after the second dose). Immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 was assessed through geometric mean titres (GMT) and seroconversion rates (SCR) of neutralising antibody and antigen-specific immunoglobulin. This clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04695652. FindingsFrom the start of this phase 2 trial to the time of interim analysis, no vaccine-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were recorded. The most common solicited adverse events across all study participants were pain at the injection site (64%), and malaise/fatigue (35%). Fever was rarely reported (<1%). For all participants in the MVC-COV1901 group, at 28 days after the second dose against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus, the GMT was 662{middle dot}3 (408 IU/mL), the GMT ratio was 163{middle dot}2, and the seroconversion rate was 99{middle dot}8%.

The origins of the 2008 crisis and the current crisis are different: the 2008 crisis was a financial crisis that spilt over into the real economy, while COVID-19 is a health and geopolitical crisis spilling over into the real economy. As such, COVID-19 C a pandemic and an existential sustainability crisis C requires different approaches. This paper explores the role of digital finance in this context on two levels. At the macro level, it identifies how digital finance has been used to address areas of systemic risk and underpin wider financial stability. At the micro level, it illustrates how digital financial tools can address a range of emerging challenges particularly relating to recovery. COVID-19 experiences are driving forward a range of efforts to build better infrastructure to address future crises, in particular interoperable electronic payments systems (including central bank digital currencies and other forms of sovereign digital currency), sovereign digital identification (particularly in the context of market integrity and non face-to-face transactions), and use of technology for regulatory, supervisory and compliance purposes, At the same time, we argue that digitization generally and of finance in particular driven by the COVID-19 crisis C while providing effective tools to support the response C have also raised new challenges, particularly around forms of TechRisk arising from control and use of data from both state and non-state actors.

Little is known about the factors influencing patients initial decisions to participate in telepsychiatry in the midst of a public health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This paper seeks to examine factors influencing patients initial decisions to accept or decline telepsychiatry immediately after the stay-at-home order in Michigan, their initial choice of virtual care modality (video or telephone), and their anticipated participation in telepsychiatry once clinics reopen for in-person visits. METHODS: Between June and August 2020, we conducted a telephone-based survey using a questionnaire comprising 14 quantitative and two qualitative items as part of a quality improvement initiative. We targeted patients who had an in-person appointment date that fell in the first few weeks following the Michigan governors stay-at-home order, necessitating conversion to virtual visits or deferment of in-person care. We used descriptive statistics to report individual survey responses and assess the association between chosen visit type and patient characteristics and future participation in telepsychiatry using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients whose original in-person appointments were scheduled within the first 3 weeks of the stay-at-home order in Michigan completed the telephone survey. The majority of the 244 respondents (n=202, 82.8%) initially chose to receive psychiatric care through video visits, while 13.5% (n=33) chose telephone visits and 1.2% (n=3) decided to postpone care until in-person visit availability. Patient age correlated with chosen visit type (P<.001; 95% CI 0.02-0.06). Patients aged 44 years were more likely than patients aged 0-44 years to opt for telephone visits (relative risk reduction [RRR] 1.2; 95% CI 1.06-1.35). Patient sex (P=.99), race (P=.06), type of insurance (P=.08), and number of previous visits to the clinic (P=.63) were not statistically relevant. Approximately half of the respondents (114/244, 46.7%) stated they were likely to continue with telepsychiatry even after in-person visits were made available. Telephone visit users were less likely than video visit users to anticipate future participation in telepsychiatry (RRR 1.08; 95% CI 0.97-1.2). Overall, virtual visits met or exceeded expectations for the majority of users. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, patient age correlates with the choice of virtual visit type, with older adults more likely to choose telephone visits over video visits.

The most notable increase is evident for younger women. The contribution of working in an industry related to the COVID-19 response played a small role at Wave 9 and the Interim 2019 Wave, but more than tripled its share in April 2020.

METHODS All patients with suspected SARS and normal chest radiographs on admission within the study period were subjected to HRCT examination. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of patients who were confirmed to have SARS-associated coronavirus infection by a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool or urine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serological testing were prospectively followed up and analyzed. Characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those that were not were compared. RESULTS Among 47 suspected SARS patients with normal chest radiographs, 27 had SARS-associated coronavirus infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or positive serological testing. Twenty-five of the 27 (93%) patients had HRCT changes compatible with atypical pneumonia, and all 25 patients developed SARS with progressive clinical deterioration. Ten (40%) had unifocal diseases, and 15 had multifocal diseases (60%). Ten (40%) patients had the diseases confined to 1 single lung in the first HRCT, and both lungs were involved at initial presentation in 15 (60%) patients. Concerning the overall extent of the disease at initial presentation, 3 (12%) patients had disease process in all lobes, and the disease was confined to 1 single lobe in 10 (40%) patients. The disease process was mainly peripheral in location (96%), and the lower lobes were more commonly involved (68% in the left lower lobe and 64% in the right lower lobe). Small parapneumonic effusions occurred in 1 (4%) patient. None of the patients with unifocal lesions or single-lung involvement were admitted to the ICU (P < 0.05) (in both comparisons). Subsequent follow-up of the 2 (7%) patients with normal HRCT on admission showed that they were having nonpneumonic SARS-associated coronavirus infection only and were eventually denotified from having SARS.

Methods: The antimicrobial efficacy of a range of antiseptics and antimicrobial agents used for skin, wound, vagina and oral antisepsis was evaluated according to the EU Standards DIN EN1276 and EN14476. The panel of organisms tested included bacterial and fungal pathogens and two enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus A16 [CA16] and Enterovirus 71 [EV71]). Results: All PVP-I products tested were highly efficacious in vitro (>99.99% kill rate) against a range of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal pathogens with rapid onset of action (30C60 seconds), at both high and low concentrations. By comparison, the efficacy of other antiseptics tested was generally reduced upon dilution.

Therefore, pregnancy in women with vasculitis has become a more frequent consideration or event. Literature on pregnancy outcomes in this population has grown and allowed us, in this article, to review the effects of pregnancy on disease activity, as well as maternal and fetal outcomes for each type of vasculitides. RECENT FINDINGS: Successful pregnancies in patients with vasculitides are possible, especially when conception is planned, and the disease is in remission. The risk of vasculitis flare is highly dependent on the type of vasculitis, but overall limited. The most frequent complication associated with large-vessel vasculitis (mainly Takayasu arteritis) is hypertension and preeclampsia. Preterm deliveries and intrauterine growth restriction occur more frequently with small- and medium-vessel vasculitis. SUMMARY: Pregnancies in patients with vasculitis should be considered high risk and followed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the field. Flares should be managed as in the non-pregnant population, while avoiding medications with unknown safety in pregnancy or known teratogens. Although commonly prescribed for the prevention of preeclampsia, there is limited evidence supporting the use of low-dose aspirin for pregnant women with vasculitis. Prospective registries or studies are needed, to better assess the value of aspirin, the place and long-term impact of new biologics and, to identify predictors of pregnancy outcomes other than disease status at conception.","output":"Pregnancy Outcomes in Systemic Vasculitides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of musculoskeletal modelling studies investigating healthy populations use generic models linearly scaled to roughly match an individual's anthropometry. Generic models disregard the considerable variation in musculoskeletal geometry and tissue properties between individuals. This study investigated the physiological implications of personalizing musculoskeletal model geometry (body segment mass, inertia, joint center, and maximum isometric muscle force). Nine healthy athletes performed ten repetitions of 15 meter sprints at 75-95% of their maximum sprinting speed and ten repetitions of unanticipated sidestep cut trials with a 4.5-5.5 m/s approach running speed. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was collected on the lower extremities, from which subject-specific musculoskeletal models were developed. A one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping paired t-test was used to compare generic and subject-specific musculoskeletal models for: lower-limb kinematics, kinetics, torque matching, as well as hamstrings, adductors, and quadriceps muscle activations and fiber dynamics. Percentage change of geometric parameters between generic and subject-specific models were determined. Compared to generic models, subject-specific models showed significantly lower ankle dorsi/plantar flexion angle during sprinting and several significantly different net joint moments during sprint and cut tasks. Additionally, subject-specific models demonstrated better torque matching, more physiologically plausible fiber lengths, higher fiber velocities, lower muscle forces, and lower simulated activations in a subset of investigated muscles and motor tasks. Furthermore, subject-specific models identified between-limb differences that were not identified with generic models. Use of subject-specific modeling, even in healthy populations, may result in more physiologically plausible muscle fiber mechanics. Implementing subject-specific models may be especially beneficial when investigating populations with substantial geometric between-limb differences, or unilateral musculoskeletal pathologies, as these are not captured by a generic model.","output":"Is subject-specific musculoskeletal modelling worth the extra effort or is generic modelling worth the shortcut?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Uma das preocupaes ligadas  pandemia da COVID-19 se refere  capacidade da estrutura do sistema de sade suportar a demanda por atendimento e tratamento de pessoas acometidas por esta doen?a.

For providers of aesthetic surgery procedures or minimal invasive cosmetic treatments, this led to a huge socio-economic impact worldwide. In order to evaluate valid clinical management strategies for future pandemic events and to overcome the challenges imposed by the current pandemic, it is paramount to analyse the socio-economic effects caused by the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online survey comprising 18 questions was sent out five times by e-mail to all members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) between June and August 2020. The data set was statistically analyzed and grouped into an overall group and into subgroups of countries with high (n = 251) vs. low (n = 440) gross domestic product per capita (GDP p.c.) and five defined world regions (Europe (n = 214); North America (NA; n = 97); South America (SA; n = 206); Asia and Oceania (Asia + OC; n = 99); Africa and Middle East (Africa + ME; n = 75)). RESULTS: A total of 691 recipients completed the survey. The majority of the participants experienced severe operating restrictions resulting in a major drop of income from surgical patients. Low GDP p.c. countries experienced a bigger negative economic impact with less aesthetic (non-) surgical procedures, whereas the high GDP p.c. subgroup was less affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Most of the survey participants had already adopted the ISAPS guidelines for patient (pre-) appointment screening and clinical/patient-flow management. For surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, in the high GDP p.c. subgroup more basic-level PPE (surgical mask) was used, whereas the low GDP p.c. subgroup relied more on advanced-level PPE (N-95 respirator mask or higher). Comparing the different world regions, Europe and Africa used more basic-level PPE. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable differences in the socio-economic impact and in the adaptation of safety protocols between high and low GDP p.c. subgroups and between different world regions were present.

The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism of the BHB in CHF. Endocardial endothelium (EE) is the BHB against leakage of blood from endocardium to the interstitium; however, this BHB is broken during CHF. Previous studies from our laboratory, and others have shown a robust activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) during CHF. MMP-9 degrades the connexins leading to EE dysfunction. We demonstrated juxtacrine coupling of EE with myocyte and mitochondria (Mito) but how it works still remains at large. To test whether activation of MMP-9 causes EE barrier dysfunction, we hypothesized that if that were the case then treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could, in fact, inhibit MMP-9, and thus preserve the EE barrier/juxtacrine signaling, and synchronous endothelial-myocyte coupling. To determine this, CHF was created by aorta-vena cava fistula (AVF) employing the mouse as a model system. The sham, and AVF mice were treated with HCQ. Cardiac hypertrophy, tissue remodeling-induced mitochondrial-myocyte, and endothelial-myocyte contractions were measured. Microvascular leakage was measured using FITC-albumin conjugate. The cardiac function was measured by echocardiography (Echo). Results suggest that MMP-9 activation, endocardial endothelial leakage, endothelial-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling, dyssynchronous mitochondrial fusion-fission (Mfn2/Drp1 ratio), and mito-myocyte uncoupling in the AVF heart failure were found to be rampant; however, treatment with HCQ successfully mitigated some of the deleterious cardiac alterations during CHF.

Rituximab, if initiated early in new-onset myasthenia gravis, can lead to faster and more sustained remission even without immunotherapies in 35% of patients at 2 years. Biomarkers determining the timing for follow-up infusions in Rituximab-responding AChR-positive patients are discussed. Most patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis treated with Rituximab have sustained long-term remission with persistent reduction of IgG4 anti-MuSK antibodies. Eculizumb in the extension REGAIN study showed sustained long-term pharmacological remissions and reduced exacerbations. Three new biologic agents showed promising results in phase-II controlled myasthenia gravis trials: Zilucoplan, a subcutaneous macrocyclic peptide inhibiting complement C5; Efgartigimod, an IgG1-derived Fc fragment binding to neonatal FcRn receptor; and Rozanolixizumab, a high-affinity anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Finally, the safety of ongoing myasthenia gravis immunotherapies during COVID19 pandemic is discussed.

However, it is unclear whether ApoE4 alters COVID-19 susceptibility or severity, and the role of direct viral infection in brain cells remains obscure. We tested the neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models and observed low-grade infection of neurons and astrocytes that is boosted in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures and organoids. We then generated isogenic ApoE3/3 and ApoE4/4 hiPSCs and found an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ApoE4/4 neurons and astrocytes. ApoE4 astrocytes exhibited enlarged size and elevated nuclear fragmentation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we show that remdesivir treatment inhibits SARS-CoV2 infection of hiPSC neurons and astrocytes. These findings suggest that ApoE4 may play a causal role in COVID-19 severity. Understanding how risk factors impact COVID-19 susceptibility and severity will help us understand the potential long-term effects in different patient populations.","output":"ApoE-Isoform-Dependent SARS-CoV-2 Neurotropism and Cellular Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This brief report aims to highlight stark mortality disparities among older Latinos that result from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We use recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to compute age-specific death rates (ASDRs) for three causes of death: deaths from COVID-19, residual deaths, and total deaths for four age-groups (55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and older) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on older Latino mortality relative to non-Latino Whites and non-Latino Blacks and also in comparison to residual deaths. Additionally, we obtain ASDRs for all causes of deaths from 1999 to 2018 to provide a pre-pandemic context and assess the extent to which the consistently observed mortality advantage of Latinos persists during the pandemic. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, our findings show that Latinos have lower ASDRs for non-COVID-19 causes of death across all age groups compared to non-Latino Whites. However, our findings indicate that Latinos have significantly higher ASDRs for COVID-19 deaths than non-Latino Whites. Furthermore, although the Latino advantage for total deaths persists during the pandemic, it has diminished significantly compared to the 1999-2018 period. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that as a result of the pandemic, the time-tested Latino paradox has rapidly diminished due to higher COVID-19 mortality among older Latino adults compared to non-Latino Whites. Future research should continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 to assess the disparate impact of the pandemic on older Black, Latino and non-Latino White adults as additional data become available.","output":"The Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Older Latino Mortality: The Rapidly Diminishing Latino Paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans swallow a great variety and often large amounts of chemicals as nutrients, incidental food additives and contaminants, drugs, and inhaled particles and chemicals, thus exposing the gastrointestinal tract to many potentially toxic substances. It serves as a barrier in many cases to protect other components of the body from such substances and infections. Fortunately, the gastrointestinal tract is remarkably robust and generally is able to withstand multiple daily assaults by the chemicals to which it is exposed. Some chemicals, however, can affect one or more aspects of the gastrointestinal tract to produce abnormal events that reflect toxicity. It is the purpose of this chapter to evaluate the mechanisms by which toxic chemicals produce their deleterious effects and to determine the consequences of the toxicity on integrity of gastrointestinal structure and function. Probably because of the intrinsic ability of the gastrointestinal tract to resist toxic chemicals, there is a paucity of data regarding gastrointestinal toxicology. It is therefore necessary in many cases to extrapolate toxic mechanisms from infectious processes, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, and other insults in addition to more conventional chemical sources of toxicity.","output":"Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Gastrointestinal Toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During an evolving outbreak or pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including physical distancing, isolation, and mask use may flatten the peak in communities. However, these strategies rely on community understanding and motivation to engage to ensure appropriate compliance and impact. To support current activities for COVID-19, the objectives of this narrative review was to identify the key determinants impacting on engagement. METHODS: An integrative narrative literature review focused on NPIs. We aimed to identify published peer-reviewed articles that focused on the general community (excluding healthcare workers), NPIs (including school closure, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing and hygiene behaviours), and factors/characteristics (including social, physical, psychological, capacity, motivation, economic and demographic) that impact on engagement. RESULTS: The results revealed that there are a range of demographic, social and psychological factors underpinning engagement with quarantine, school closures, and personal protective behaviours. Aside from the factors impacting on acceptance and compliance, there are several key community concerns about their use that need to be addressed including the potential for economic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is important that we acknowledge that these strategies will have an impact on an individual and the community. By understanding the barriers, we can identify what strategies need to be adopted to motivate individuals and improve community compliance. Using a behavioural framework to plan interventions based on these key barriers, will also ensure countries implement appropriate and targeted responses.","output":"Improving the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19: examining the factors that influence engagement and the impact on individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the face mask (FM)-related ocular surface changes using clinical tests, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and impression cytology (IC), and to investigate the Dry Eye-related Quality of life Score (DEQS). METHODS: Sixty-six patients with dry eye disease (DED) and 62 healthy subjects (group 2) using FM were enrolled. Groups were divided into: groups 1A and 2A: < 3 hours of FM wear; groups 1B and 2B: 3 to 6 hours; and groups 1C and 2C: > 6 hours. Patients underwent DEQS questionnaire, break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), fluorescein and lissamine staining (FS and LS), IVCM to determine corneal dendritic cell density (DCD) and goblet cell density (GCD), and IC to measure HLA-DR, at baseline and after 3 months. RESULTS: FM use duration before enrollment was 27  2.3 and 30  4.1 (days  SD) for groups 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). After 3 months, DEQS worsened in groups 1B and 1C, STI in groups 1A to 1C, FS and LS in group 1C (P < 0.05); in controls, BUT and FS worsened only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DCD significantly increased in groups 1A to 1C and HLA-DR in groups 1B and 1C (P < 0.05), whereas GCD did not significantly change. DCD and HLA-DR increased only in group 2C (P < 0.05).

By providing agents the freedom to select their actions and learn from their experiences, RL allows agents to learn behavioural policies that reduce the spread of COVID-19. These behaviours can be analyzed, conditional on demographic attributes with the hopes of providing a more granular analysis to inform public health policymakers. The learned agent behaviours are compared to multiple baselines, as well we introduce two non-compliant scenarios, namely the addition of wildcard agents and compliance attrition. We found that the RL model was able to considerably reduce the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the population, even in the non-compliance model scenarios.

It has long been assumed that cargo triggers local CME site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the discovery that cortical actin patches, which cluster near exocytic sites, are CME sites. Quantitative imaging data reported here lead to a radically different view of which CME steps are regulated and which steps are deterministic. We quantitatively and spatially describe progression through the CME pathway and pinpoint a cargo-sensitive regulatory transition point that governs progression from the initiation phase of CME to the internalization phase. Thus, site maturation, rather than site initiation, accounts for the previously observed polarized distribution of actin patches in this organism. While previous studies suggested that cargo ensures its own internalization by regulating either CME initiation rates or frequency of abortive events, our data instead identify maturation through a checkpoint in the pathway as the cargo-sensitive step.","output":"Spatial regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis through position-dependent site maturation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the eighth edition of the BioASQ Challenge, which will run as an evaluation Lab in the context of CLEF2020.

Not all parameters have the same effect on the pedestrian speed. According to the literature, gender and age are the most researched parameters that have an impact on the speed of pedestrians. However, a small number of authors have dealt with the influence of movement regimes (slow, normal, fast, run, and rush) on pedestrian speed, while at the same time taking into account age and gender. For that reason, this article measured the speed of movement of school age children by movement regimes, taking into account age and gender. Within the same movement regime, the influence of age, sex, height, and weight on the speed of movement was investigated. Experimental measurements of the speed of movement of pedestrians aged 7 to 20 years were performed. Based on the results of measurements and statistical analyzes, recommendations on the average speed of movement regimes, age, and gender are given.","output":"Determination of Moving Speed of School Age Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID\\\\19 outbreaks on emergency patients in a resuscitation room in Nanning, China.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines available in Italy in preventing hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia, a matched case-control study was performed in elderly subjects during the 2010C2011 season in Genoa (Italy). Cases and controls were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to gender, age, socio-economic status and type of influenza vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as IVE = [(1-OR)x100] and crude odds ratios were estimated through conditional logistic regression models. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated through multivariable logistic models. In the study area, influenza activity was moderate in the 2010C2011 season, with optimal matching between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. We recruited 187 case-control pairs; 46.5% of cases and 79.1% of controls had been vaccinated. The adjuvanted influenza vaccines (Fluad(?) considered together with Inflexal V(?)) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization, their effectiveness being 94.8% (CI 77.1C98.8). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 95.2% (CI 62.8C99.4) and 87.8 (CI 0.0C98.9) for Inflexal V(?) and Fluad(?), respectively. Both adjuvanted vaccines proved effective, although the results displayed statistical significance only for Inflexal V(?) (p = 0.004), while for Fluad(?) statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.09). Our study is the first to provide information on the effectiveness of Inflexal V(?) in terms of reducing hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia in the elderly, and demonstrates that this vaccine yields a high degree of protection and that its use would generate considerable saving for the National Health Service.","output":"Effectiveness of adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (Inflexal V(?) and Fluad(?)) in preventing hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia in the elderly: A matched case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence.

However, the mechanisms leading to lymphopenia remain unclear. In this study, the number of total CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and NK cells in the peripheral blood were dramatically reduced in C57BL/6 mice infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O, and it was noted that mice with severe clinical symptoms had expressively lower lymphocyte counts than mice with mild or without clinical symptoms, indicating that lymphopenia was associated with disease severity. A further analysis revealed that lymphocyte apoptosis and trafficking occurred after FMDV infection. In addition, coinhibitory molecules were upregulated in the expression of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from FMDV-infected mice, including CTLA-4, LAG-3, 2B4, and TIGIT. Interestingly, the elevated IL-10 in the serum was correlated with the appearance of lymphopenia during FMDV infection but not IL-6, IL-2, IL-17, IL-18, IL-1, TNF-, IFN-/, TGF-, and CXCL1. Knocking out IL-10 (IL-10(-/-)) mice or blocking IL-10/IL-10R signaling in vivo was able to prevent lymphopenia via downregulating apoptosis, trafficking, and the coinhibitory expression of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, which contribute to enhance the survival of mice infected with FMDV.

The Care Ecosystem (CE) is a model of dementia care designed to support people with dementia and their family caregiver dyads through ongoing contact with a care team navigator (CTN) and an expert clinical team. CTNs provide support, education, and resources and help dyads manage dementia-related concerns as they evolve over the course of the disease. We aimed to understand how the CE responded to the needs of dyads during the initial 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a survey and qualitative interviews with staff members from 4 established CE programs located in 4 different states to explore (a) challenges dyads voiced during the pandemic, (b) CE staff approaches to addressing the needs of dyads, and (c) programmatic challenges faced and lessons learned. FINDINGS: Nine staff members from 4 CE programs with an active collective caseload of 379 dyads were interviewed. Themes were identified that included dyad concerns regarding fear of illness, changing attitudes toward long-term care, decreased availability of services and resources, and impacts on patient and caregiver health and well-being. Programmatic challenges included maintaining effective communication with dyads and program staff, technological readiness, workflow restructuring, and program sustainability. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Approaches in supporting people with dementia and their caregivers should demonstrate flexibility, responsivity, and creativity, and these findings provide insight for understanding how dementia care programs can be positioned to offer continuous support for this vulnerable population.","output":"Responding to the Needs of Persons Living With Dementia and Their Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons From the Care Ecosystem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombocytopenia is common in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting due to endogenous and iatrogenic factors.

Taking this regional Guide as reference, this study was aimed at estimating the adequacy of the antimicrobial stewardship at discharge from a pediatric Emergency Department (ED). Secondarily, the differences in adequacy according to the diagnosis and the prescriber were studied, and the agreement between this Guide and the protocols of the ED was assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive, retrospective study was conducted on patients under 16 years old, with a diagnosis included in the regional Guide who were discharged from a pediatric ED between March of 2018 and February of 2019. Prescription was considered adequate when the indication, the antibiotic and the posology (dosage, dosing interval, length of treatment and route of administration) were correct. RESULTS: 165 out of 648 (25,5%) infectious diseases processes analyzed received antimicrobial treatment. In 23 processes treated with antimicrobial, the adequacy could not be evaluated due to the absence of data necessary to assess any aspect of posology. Therapy was considered appropriate in 550/625 processes (88.0%). When antimicrobial treatment was prescribed, 70/142 (49.3%) were appropriate and no statistically significant differences in adequacy were found between prescribers. Posology was the worst handled point of the prescription (26.3%). Tract urinary infection, conjunctivitis and otitis media were the pathologies with the lowest adecuacy (44.4%; 50.0% and 52.2%) and presented the highest discrepancy between the Guide and the center protocols (a?=a?0.308; a?=a?0.000; a?=a?0.586). CONCLUSIONS: The adequacy of the management of infectious processes to the reference Guide in our pediatric ED was high, but it was below 50% when antimicrobial treatment was required. The degree of adequacy to the local protocols of the center was greater than to the regional Guide. This reveals a discrepancy between the 2 documents that should be analyzed and corrected according to the available scientific evidence.","output":"Adecuacy of pediatric antimicrobial prescribing in the Emergency Department at discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural polymers, based on proteins or polysaccharides, have attracted increasing interest in recent years due to their broad potential uses in biomedicine.

While following links may result in the discovery of complementary data sources and enriched query results, it is widely recognized that traversing the LOD Cloud indiscriminately results in low quality answers. Over the years, approaches have been published that help to determine whether links are trustworthy or not, based on certain criteria. While such approaches are often useful for specific datasets and/or in specific applications, they are not yet widely used in practice or at the scale of the entire LOD Cloud. This paper introduces a new resource called MetaLink. MetaLink is a dataset that contains metadata for a very large set of owl:sameAs links that are crawled from the LOD Cloud. MetaLink encodes a previously published error metric for each of these links. MetaLink is published in combination with LOD-a-lot, a dataset that is based on a large crawl of a subset of the LOD Cloud. By combining MetaLink and LOD-a-lot, applications are able to make informed decisions about whether or not to follow specific links on the LOD Cloud.

To answer this question, we investigate the effects of framing access-based consumption in terms of two primary benefits: affordability and variety. Results from four studies suggest that although affordability might rationally be of most interest to financially-constrained individuals, framing access-based consumptions benefits in terms of affordability undermines the happiness they may extract from their consumption relative to framing in terms of variety. This difference emerges because communications focused on affordability re-affirm the negative self-identity financially-constrained individuals perceive as a result of their financial situation.

Thereby, we aim at fulfilling three main goals: offering thorough coordinated management for all, and improving physical activity and quality of life of the patients. AIM With rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), patients and their family often suffer from inadequate recognition of their disease, poor care coordination and incomplete information. A coordinated interdisciplinary approach is one possible solution for providing both comprehensive and cost-effective care, with benefits for patient satisfaction. Poor physical activity and impaired quality of life represent a considerable burden for these patients. To better address these issues, in 2012 we created an interdisciplinary team for the management of OI patients in our University Hospital Centre (CHUV, Lausanne University Hospital,). In this article we describe the implementation of this interdisciplinary care strategy for patients suffering from OI, and its impact on their physical activity and quality of life. METHODS All patients from the French part of Switzerland were invited to join us. We proposed two complementary evaluations: the initial interdisciplinary evaluation and a yearly follow-up during a special day C the OI day. This day features specialised medical appointments adapted to each patients needs, as well as lectures and/or workshops dedicated to patients and families education. Our first aim was to propose for each patient the same management, from diagnosis to the bone health evaluation and physical therapy advice. Our second aim was to evaluate the evolution of physical activity, quality of life (measured by EQ-5D, SF-36 and a dedicated questionnaire) and satisfaction of patients and their families. Here we report both the initial and the long-term results. RESULTS Since 2012, 50 patients from the French part of Switzerland received the personalised medical evaluation. All of the patients included in this study had the same initial evaluation and at least one participation in an OI Day. All patients had an adaptation of their bone acting drugs. Over a 7-year period, 62% of inactive patients started some physical activity, and 44% of patients who were not involved in any athletic activity started participating in sports. The mean EQ-5D increased from 0.73 to 0.75 (p = 0.59). The mean physical SF36 (musculoskeletal function) score was 59.09  22.72 and improved to 65.79  21.51 (p = 0.08), whereas it was 68.06  20.05 for the mental SF36 without alteration during follow-up. The OI day was revealed to be useful, it contributed to improvement in continuity of care and helped families to better understand the OI patients health. CONCLUSIONS Our interdisciplinary approach aimed at offering the same thorough management for all patients from the French part of Switzerland, and at improving both the physical activity and the satisfaction of the patients and their family.

In the United States, as of 10/16/2021 188.9 million are fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. VAM has an incidence of 4.8 cases per million post 2nd dose of mRNA vaccines. We present a case of mRNA VAM in a young male and challenges faced in screening and management of this rare condition in a time where clearer guidelines are needed. Case: 45 y/o male with no PMH presented with acute onset sharp midsternal chest pain associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine three days prior. Initial EKG: ST-elevations in leads V2-V4;troponin 4.37 (peaked at 7.3);CRP 25.8. Coreg was initiated. Emergent cardiac catheterization: nonobstructive CAD, mildly reduced systolic function 50%. Subsequent echo: EF 40% with mild hypokinesis in apical segments. Colchicine was started. Symptoms resolved and patient was discharged with avoidance of strenuous activity. 1st follow-up: improved symptomatology. Lisinopril was added. Repeat echo: EF 60%. 2nd follow-up 2 weeks later: he had presyncope. Holter: no arrhythmia. Cardiac MRI: multifocal mid-myocardial and subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement in apical and basal segments consistent with myocarditis. After 2 months, the patient was asymptomatic and exercise tolerant. Decision-making: New data from the CDC, and the Israeli National Database indicate a causal relationship between the new mRNA vaccines and the increase in VAM. This complication predominantly affects young males like this patient within 7 days post 2nd dose. In this age group, observed numbers of VAM were > 10 times more than expected. This data incited a high index of suspicion which led to the diagnosis. Conclusion: Since this vaccine technology will likely monopolize future vaccine production, this condition is expected to increase in prevalence and the medical community needs to remain vigilant. Better guidance is needed on how best to screen and manage. Further research is thus warranted. We maintain that mRNA vaccines provide benefits which far outweigh this often self-limited complication.","output":"HIGHLIGHTING THE RISE OF VACCINE-ASSOCIATED MYOCARDITIS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE OF MRNA VACCINES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandatory mask bylaws are set to be instated in both Calgary and Edmonton, and other regions of Canada in efforts to reduce transmission of COVID-19.

This communiqu highlights some key considerations for implementation of inclusive mandatory mask guidelines. The City of Calgary and other jurisdictions are implementing a bylaw that mandates face coverings be worn in public transit, public vehicles for hire, public indoor space and City public facilities.

The review included 12 studies, which assessed digital contact tracing for the following infectious diseases: Ebola, tuberculosis, pertussis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review revealed low-certainty evidence of a decrease in secondary cases of the targeted infectious disease, if digital contact tracing was used. However, it is uncertain from the currently available evidence whether digital contact tracing would produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce the time taken to complete contact tracing.

Despite favorable outcomes of laparoscopic surgery in high-income countries, its implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging given a shortage of consumable supplies, high cost, and risk of power outages. To overcome these barriers, we designed a mechanical retractor that provides vertical tension on the anterior abdominal wall. Methods. The retractor design is anatomically and mathematically optimized to provide exposure similar to traditional gas-based insufflation methods. Anatomical data from computed tomography scans were used to define retractor size. The retractor is constructed of biocompatible stainless steel rods and paired with a table-mounted lifting system to provide 5 degrees of freedom. Structural integrity was assessed through finite element analysis (FEA) and load testing. Functional testing was performed in a laparotomy model. Results. A user guide based on patient height and weight was created to customize retractor size, and 4 retractor sizes were constructed. FEA data using a 13.6 kg mass (15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum) show a maximum of 30 mm displacement with no permanent deformation. Physical load testing with applied weight from 0 to 13.6 kg shows a maximum of 60 mm displacement, again without permanent deformation. Retraction achieved a 57% larger field of view compared to an unretracted state in a laparotomy model. Conclusions. The KeyLoop retractor maintains structural integrity, is easily sterilized, and can be readily manufactured, making it a viable alternative to traditional insufflation methods.

Dosing optimisation requires a good knowledge of PK/PD principles. This review serves to provide a foundation in PK/PD principles for the commonly prescribed antibiotics (-lactams, vancomycin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides), as well as dosing considerations in special populations (critically ill and obese patients). PK principles determine whether an appropriate dose of antimicrobial reaches the intended pathogen(s). It involves the fundamental processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, and is affected by the antimicrobial's physicochemical properties. Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics define the relationship between the drug concentration and its observed effect on the pathogen. The major indicator of the effect of the antibiotics is the minimum inhibitory concentration. The quantitative relationship between a PK and microbiological parameter is known as a PK/PD index, which describes the relationship between dose administered and the rate and extent of bacterial killing. Improvements in clinical outcomes have been observed when antimicrobial agents are dosed optimally to achieve their respective PK/PD targets. With the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and a limited drug development pipeline, PK/PD concepts can foster more rational and individualised dosing regimens, improving outcomes while simultaneously limiting the toxicity of antimicrobials.","output":"Optimisation of antimicrobial dosing based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the issue of a lack of interpersonal touch has gained much public interest due to the social distancing ordered by the authorities in the present pandemic situation [...].","output":"Touch ResearchCQuo Vadis?

Appropriate public health and control measures will require discovery of the zoonotic MERS coronavirus reservoirs. The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry. Cell entry begins with virus spike (S) protein binding to DPP4 receptors. We constructed chimeric DPP4 receptors that have the virus-binding domains of indigenous Middle Eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting S protein binding and virus entry. Human, camel, and horse receptors were potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors, while goat and bat receptors were considerably less effective. These patterns reflected S protein affinities for the receptors. However, even the low-affinity receptors could hypersensitize cells to infection when an S-cleaving protease(s) was present, indicating that affinity thresholds for virus entry must be considered in the context of host-cell proteolytic environments. These findings suggest that virus receptors and S protein-cleaving proteases combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several Middle Eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting MERS-CoV to humans. IMPORTANCE MERS is a frequently fatal disease that is caused by a zoonotic CoV. The animals transmitting MERS-CoV to humans are not yet known. Infection by MERS-CoV requires receptors and proteases on host cells. We compared the receptors of humans and Middle Eastern animals and found that human, camel, and horse receptors sensitized cells to MERS-CoV infection more robustly than goat and bat receptors. Infection susceptibility correlated with affinities of the receptors for viral spike proteins. We also found that the presence of a cell surface lung protease greatly increases susceptibility to MERS-CoV, particularly in conjunction with low-affinity receptors. This cataloguing of human and animal host cell factors allows one to make inferences on the distribution of MERS-CoV in nature.","output":"Receptor variation and susceptibility to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent response by governments to introduce national lockdown regulations have confined individuals to their residential premises.

However, without the availability of this coping mechanism, many individuals have been forced to use virtual sport training technology to keep active. This preliminary quantitative study investigated the role of technology, in particular virtual sport training technology (if any) by cyclists as emotional coping mechanism during a period of national lockdown. The results of an online survey indicated that sport, in general, has always been an emotional coping mechanism during normal challenging situations but that slightly more respondents used sport as mechanism during the lockdown period. Respondents indicated that virtual cycling training technology enabled them to continue with using their normal coping mechanism even in a period of national lockdown. One of the benefits of a virtual training environment is the ability to socialize by riding with virtual team members. Surprisingly, the number of cyclists who preferred riding alone in the virtual cycling environment was slightly more than the cyclists who preferred to join scheduled rides with virtual team members.

It is well-established that males are more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit more severe outcomes. Similarly, exposure to air pollutants and pre-existing respiratory chronic conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) confer an increased risk to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We investigated molecular patterns associated with risk factors in 398 candidate genes relevant to COVID-19 biology. To accomplish this, we downloaded DNA methylation and gene expression datasets from publicly available repositories (GEO and GTEx portal) and utilized data from our unpublished controlled human exposure study. Results First, we observed sex-biased DNA methylation patterns in autosomal immune genes such as NLRP2, TLE1, GPX1, and ARRB2 (FDR <0.05, magnitude of DNA methylation difference  >0.05). Second, our analysis on the X-linked genes identified sex associated DNA methylation profiles in genes such as ACE2, CA5B, and HS6ST2 (FDR <0.05,  >0.05). These associations were observed across multiple respiratory tissues (lung, nasal epithelia, airway epithelia, and bronchoalveolar lavage) and in whole blood. Some of these genes, like NLRP2 and CA5B, also exhibited sex-biased expression patterns. Third, we identified modest DNA methylation changes in CpGs associated with PRIM2 and TATDN1 (FDR <0.1,  >0.05) in response to particle-depleted diesel exhaust in bronchoalveolar lavage. Finally, we captured a DNA methylation signature associated with COPD diagnosis in a gene involved in nicotine dependence (COMT) (FDR <0.1,  >0.05). Conclusion Our findings on sex differences are of clinical relevance given they potentially point to an exaggerated immune response in males. We also found tissue-specific DNA methylation differences in response to particulate exposure potentially capturing an NO2 effect C a contributor to COVID-19 susceptibility. While we identified a molecular signature associated with COPD, all COPD-affected individuals were smokers, which may either reflect an association with the disease, smoking, or may highlight a compounded effect of these two risk factors in COVID-19. Overall, the findings point towards the molecular basis of variation in susceptibility factors that may partly explain disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Risk-focused Differences in Molecular Processes Implicated in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Corollaries in DNA Methylation and Gene Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, discovered in late 2019, being continued to spread across regions worldwide, has resulted in 1,914,916 confirmed cases with up to 123,010 deaths, as in situation report C85 by World Health Organization (WHO) Most of the developed disease monitoring and tracking tools currently available only present the reported cases up to country-level and not detail down to provincial- or state-, city- level within the countries This is insignificant for supporting activities in quickly reducing and preventing the spread of the disease within a certain country because further detail potential infectious locations are not provided for people to avoid traveling or passing by there Thus, this work presents an open toolbox for generating map of actively Confirmed cases in a country, i e , Vietnam, given a dataset containing their statuses and current locations, detail down to provincial-or state-, city-level The newly released algorithm reduced approximately 24 41% of processing time of the preceding one In addition, the algorithm can be easily extended for supporting other countries given suitable datasets","output":"An Open Toolbox For Generating Map Of Actively Confirmed Sars-Cov-2 Or COVID-19 Cases In Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Short distance travel and commute being inevitable, safe route planning in pandemics for micro-mobility, i.e., cycling and walking, is extremely important for the safety of oneself and others.

The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic N-codes 995.5 (child abuse) and 995.8 (adult abuse) or E-codes E960CE969 (homicide and intentional injury by others) were defined as the case study for this study, and the risks of first violent injury for boys and girls (0C17 years old), adults (18C64 years old), and elders (over 65 years old) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used for risk comparison. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: The proportion of women (12C17.9 years old) who were sexually assaulted was 2.71 times that of women under the age of 12, and the risk of sexual assault for girls and adult women was 100 times that of men. Girls who were insured as labor insurance, farmers, members of water conservancy and fishery associations, low-income households, and community insured population (public insurance as the reference group) were significantly more likely to seek medical treatment from sexual assault than adult women. Among them, the risk was greatest for girls from low-income households (odds ratio = 10.74). Conclusion: Women are at higher risk of sexual assault than men regardless of whether they are children or adults, and the highest risk is for women in senior high schools, especially for girls from low-income households. Therefore, the protection of womens personal autonomy is the direction that the government and people from all walks of life need to continue to strive for. Especially for high school students from low-income households, protection must be strengthened through education, social work, and police administration.","output":"Sexual Assault Is the Biggest Risk Factor for Violence against Women in TaiwanA Nationwide Population Cohort Study from 2000 to 2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammasomes are filamentous signaling platforms integral to innate immunity.

In silico simulations using Rosetta and molecular dynamics followed by biochemical and cellular experiments consistently demonstrate that individual filaments assemble bidirectionally. By contrast, the recognition between AIM2 and ASC requires at least one to be oligomeric and occurs in a head-to-tail manner. Using in silico mutagenesis as a guide, we also identify specific axial and lateral interfaces that dictate the recognition and distinction between AIM2 and ASC filaments.

BACKGROUND: During pandemic process, nurses reported to experience stress due to a very high risk of being infected and hard work. METHOD: A descriptive study. The sample of the study consisted of 169 emergency nurses. To collect data, a personal information form was used together with the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: The factors that significantly affect the perceived stress score of emergency nurses during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic included applying respiratory isolation, changing the way of life, not being able to access protective equipment, insufficient nurses in the unit and thinking that COVID\\\\19 will be transmitted to oneself. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the emergency nurses perceived stress above average during pandemic, and their working conditions affected this situation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Meeting physiological needs and applying psychological guidance and counselling interventions in the stress management of emergency nurses may contribute to the reduction of their stress levels.

One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected. Materials SARS-CoV-2 virions (2104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay. Results Vero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure. Conclusions Si3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Silicon Nitride Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a new variant of TGE with an altered pathogenesis. PRCV multiplies mainly in tonsilar tissues and the respiratory tract. There are no enteric symptoms and in experimentally infected pigs, even the respiratory tract infection is usually asymptomatic. PRCV is spread aerogenically through herds and the significance of PRCV as a pathogen in swine has yet to be determined. Despite the differences in pathogenesis and tissue tropism, the behavior of TGEV and PRCV are closely related antigenically. PRCV induces an antibody response in pigs that cannot be distinguished from TGEV-infected pigs by conventional serological assays. PRCV sensitized animals are not protected from TGEV challenge nor is the milk antibody provided to nursing piglets completely effective in prevention of TGEV infections; thus PRCV is not a good vaccine candidate for TGEV infections. PRCV subclinical infections have led to several reported cases of enzootic TGEV in herds that had been diagnosed as TGEV immune strictly on the basis of serum neutralizing titers which were later found to be due to exposure to PRCV. Vaccination studies conducted with the Ambico, oral modified live TGEV vaccine have led to some startling new results: (1) Use of Ambico TGEV modified live vaccine has been shown to provide complete protection against subsequent PRCV challenge and (2) the effectiveness of TGEV vaccination is actually enhanced by previous exposure to PRCV (3) Weanling pigs which have passively acquired circulating TGEV neutralizing antibodies are protected from subsequent PRCV infections.","output":"An overview of successful TGEV vaccination strategies and discussion on the interrelationship between TGEV and PRCV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe pneumonia is the most common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory disease (COVID-19). Due to its rapid outbreak, units for the evaluation of febrile patients in the pre-hospital setting were created. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to develop a sensitive and simple tool to assess the risk of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and thus select which patients would require a chest imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in a cohort of individuals with suspected COVID-19 evaluated in a public academic healthcare center in Buenos Aires city. All adult patients with positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-COV2 between April 24 and May 19 of 2020 were included in the study. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of compatible signs and symptoms with imaging confirmation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. A risk indicator score was developed. RESULTS One hundred and forty-eight patients were included, 71 (48%) received the diagnosis of pneumonia. The final clinical model included four variables: age >- 40 years, cough, absence of sore throat, and respiratory rate >- 22. To create the score, we assigned values to the variables according to their ORs: 2 points for respiratory rate >- 22 and 1 point to the other variables. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.80 (CI 95% 0.73-0.86). A cutoff value of 2 showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 43.24%.

Physicians are exposed to increasing moral conflict situations, which may cause Moral Distress (MD). MD occurs when someone thinks he or she might know the morally correct action but cannot act upon this knowledge because of in- or external constraints. Correlations of MD among residents to job changes and burn-out have been shown previously. There are, however, hardly any quantitative studies about MD among physicians in Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of occurrence, the level of disturbance, and reasons for MD among neurological residents in German hospitals. METHODS 1st qualitative phase: Open interviews on workload and ethical conflicts in everyday clinical practice were conducted with five neurological residents. Ethical principles of medical action and potential constraints that could cause MD were identified and a questionnaire designed. 2nd quantitative phase: A preliminary questionnaire was tested and evaluated by five further neurological residents. The final questionnaire consisted of 12 items and was conducted online and anonymously via e-mail or on-site as part of an unrelated resident training event at 56 sites. RESULTS One hundred seven neurological residents from 56 university/acute care and rehabilitation hospitals throughout Germany were examined (response rate of those requesting the questionnaire: 75.1%). 96.3% of the participants had experienced MD weekly (3.86, SD 1.02), because they were unable to invest the necessary time in a patient or relative consultation. Errors in medical care, which could not be communicated adequately with patients or relatives, were rated as most distressing. The most common reasons for MD were the growing numbers of patients, expectations of patient relatives, fears of legal consequences, incentives of the DRG-system, and the increasing bureaucratization requirement. 43.0% of participants mentioned they considered leaving the field of inpatient-care. 65.4% stated they would like more support in conflict situations. CONCLUSION MD plays an important role for neurological residents in German hospitals and has an impact on participants' consideration of changing the workplace. Important aspects are rationing (time/beds) and incentives for overdiagnosis as well as lack of internal communication culture and mentoring.","output":"Moral distress among residents in neurology: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections today remain one of the global problems.

Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70 000) and 0.07% (21 of 30 000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70 000; 21 of 35 000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively.

Due to the poverty rate in Africa, as well as poor access to quality health care, inadequate medical staff and poor technology, Africa has been predicted to be one of the most severely affected continents in the world by COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting approach. The source of the data used for this study was the secondary data obtained from the daily publication/report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28th February 2020 to 30th June 2020. The mean daily survival rate of COVID-19 patients was found to be 27.5% with a median survival rate of 25.4% which is below 50%. Also, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) was identified to be appropriate for predicting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria within the observed period. Further findings showed that little variation exists between the predicted and actual survival rate of COVID19 for June 2020 which indicates that the obtained ARIMA model (0, 1, 1) was adequate for the estimation of the survival rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Based on the findings of the study, the need for the Nigerian government to explore effective treatment strategies both internationally and locally to improve the survival rate of patients with the disease was strongly recommended.

Flaviviral proteases share a high degree of structural similarity and substrate-recognition profile, which may facilitate a strategy towards development of pan-flaviviral protease inhibitors.

Even after lockdown, the pandemic fear created additional barriers to access the health services. The aim of our study is to evaluate the economic impact of the lockdown for COVID-19 on public health in Italy, focusing on its effects on diabetic population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the impact of the lockdown on excess mortality and morbidity in the Italian diabetic population during 2020. The analysis was divided into several steps: a quantification of specialist visit reduction, the calculation of excess mortality in the diabetic population, the economic evaluation of the slowdown in the use of innovative diabetic therapies. Furthermore, the impact of the lockdown on the reduction of procedures and follow-up visits in diabetic population was evaluated. The overall impact of the pandemic and lockdown effects on costs and quality of life was then calculated. RESULTS: During 2020, a drop of 28% in patient access has been observed. Diabetic patients recorded a twice higher mortality value compared to general population (20.4% vs 10.2%). The analysis of market data revealed a slowdown in consumption of new antidiabetic therapies (?14%, 27% vs 41%). We estimated an expense of 26.6 million for NHS and a loss of 257 utilities in diabetic population due to the missed benefits related to slowdown in innovative antidiabetic drugs use and non-optimal follow-up and control of diabetes complications. In simulation scenarios, we also estimated an overall expenditure ranging from 38.7 to 94.0 million and a loss of 294C836 utilities.

Although the planktonic states reduce the pathogens bacterial about 1 -1.5 log, but in biofilm forms, decreased L. monocytogenes about 4.5 log compared to the control, and in the case of P. aeruginosa, a growth reduction of about 2.13 log was observed. Furthermore, biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes in the presence of L. rhamnosus cell-free supernatant was more weakly than L. plantarum CFS, but their CFS effect on reducing the bacterial population of P. aeruginosa was the same. According to the study, biofilm produced by probiotic strains can be considered a new approach for biological control. Also, cell-free supernatant can be used as postbiotic in the food and pharmaceutical industries.","output":"Biofilm formation and antagonistic activity of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (PTCC1712) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (PTCC1745)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, millions of people suffer from various substance use disorders (SUD), including mono-and polydrug use of opioids and methamphetamine. Brain regions such as the cingulate cortex, infralimbic cortex, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, basolateral and central amygdala have been shown to play important roles in addiction-related behavioral changes. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have characterized these brain regions and their corresponding neurochemical changes in numerous phases of drug dependence such as acute drug use, intoxication, craving, withdrawal, and relapse. At present, many studies have reported the individual effects of opioids and methamphetamine. However, little is known about their combined effects. Co-use of these drugs produces effects greater than either drug alone, where one decreases the side effects of the other, and the combination produces a prolonged intoxication period or a more desirable intoxication effect. An increasing number of studies have associated polydrug abuse with poorer treatment outcomes, drug-related deaths, and more severe psychopathologies. To date, the pharmacological treatment efficacy for polydrug abuse is vague, and still at the experimental stage. This present review discusses the human and animal behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurochemical changes underlying both morphine and methamphetamine dependence separately, as well as its combination.

Three hundred and fifty rodents (269 rats and 81 mice) trapped during vegetative, flowering/fruiting and mature/harvesting stages of crops were studied from 2011-2013. Hymenolepisdiminuta eggs were identified on the basis of their shape, size, colour and markings on the surface of the egg shell and three pairs of embryonic hook-lets. Overall prevalence of H. diminuta was 3.14% (n=11/350). The highest prevalence 3.49% (n=5/143) of H. diminuta was noted at harvesting stages of the crops whereas the lowest 2.59% (n=2/77) during vegetative stage. Infection was higher in males 3.25% (n=7/215) than females 2.96% (n=4/135). Adult rodents were highly infected while no sub-adult was found infected.

RECENT FINDINGS Sensitive new diagnostic methods have increased the detection rate of the causative agent up to 94%. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prevalent bacterial pathogen in all ages. Polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which have gained greater importance in recent years. During the period covered by this review, two new agents causing pneumonia were extensively studied. Human metapneumonovirus detected in young children is a leading cause of respiratory disease during the first years of life. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of severe respiratory syndrome, a new respiratory illness that affects adults and children. One multicenter trial concluded that nonsevere pneumonia can be treated with a short course of oral amoxicillin and a multicenter international study showed that children with severe pneumonia have similar outcomes whether treated with oral amoxicillin or parenteral penicillin, but more data are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such regimens. SUMMARY The continued evolution of bacterial resistance highlights the need for appropriate use of antibacterials. Improved diagnostic techniques will aid the treatment of children with community-acquired pneumonia. Aggressive vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and other available vaccines as well as the development of new vaccines will aid the prevention of respiratory disease in children.","output":"Community-acquired pneumonia in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Even though the treatment of the original variant was not fully determined, variants of COVID-19 emerged. Whether the clinic of COVID-19 has changed because of variation is controversial. The present study aimed to examine the COVID-19 severity and treatment responsiveness of critically ill patients between the original virus and emergent variations with a more comprehensive set of measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment responses, laboratory findings, and clinical conditions of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were identified with variants between February 1st, and May 30th, 2021, were examined in two medical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in tertiary care centers. Each patient received treatment in the ICU for at least one week. RESULTS: Sixty-five (30 patients with the original variant: POV) critically ill patients were included in the study. SOFA scores, blood glucose, total bilirubin, urea-creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased significantly in POV (p=.031, p=.002, p=.002, p=.008, and p=.007, respectively). Overall, patients with emergent variants (PEV) (M = 76.58, SD = 8.64) had lower partial-pressure-of-oxygen/fraction-of-inspired-oxygen ratios (P/F) than POV (M = 123.16, SD = 9.49). Use of the prone position and steroid therapy did not result in significant improvements in oxygenation of critically ill PEV. Hypertension was identified as the common comorbidity in PEV (OR=5.287). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the state of PEV was more severe than POV at the time of ICU admission. However, the prone position and steroids were not efficient in improving the P/F ratios. P/F ratios of PEV were significantly lower in non-invasive ventilation. These results suggest that early intubation might be necessary for PEV.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 variation on the treatment response and disease severity in critical illness: a retrospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sequence signatures of multidonor broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies can be used to quantify the prevalence of B cells with virus-neutralizing potential to accelerate development of broadly protective vaccine strategies. Antibodies of the same class share similar recognition modes and developmental pathways, and several antibody classes have been identified that neutralize diverse group 1- and group 2-influenza A viruses and have been observed in multiple human donors. One such multidonor antibody class, the HV6-1-derived class, targets the stem region of hemagglutinin with extraordinary neutralization breadth. Here, we use an iterative process to combine informatics, biochemical, and structural analyses to delineate an improved sequence signature for HV6-1-class antibodies. Based on sequence and structure analyses of known HV6-1 class antibodies, we derived a more inclusive signature (version 1), which we used to search for matching B-cell transcripts from published next-generation sequencing datasets of influenza vaccination studies. We expressed selected antibodies, evaluated their function, and identified amino acid-level requirements from which to refine the sequence signature (version 2). The cryo-electron microscopy structure for one of the signature-identified antibodies in complex with hemagglutinin confirmed motif recognition to be similar to known HV6-1-class members, MEDI8852 and 56.a.09, despite differences in recognition-loop length. Threading indicated the refined signature to have increased accuracy, and signature-identified heavy chains, when paired with the light chain of MEDI8852, showed neutralization comparable to the most potent members of the class. Incorporating sequences of additional class members thus enables an improved sequence signature for HV6-1-class antibodies, which can identify class members with increased accuracy.","output":"Sequence-Signature Optimization Enables Improved Identification of Human HV6-1-Derived Class Antibodies That Neutralize Diverse Influenza A Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can cause damage to the lung, which can result in progressive respiratory failure and potential death.

On the other hand, the Central Asian economies are hard hit by the pandemic with a reduced regional trade, decline in oil prices and its commodities, deep slump in remittances, and the slackening manufacturing ability. The revival of BRI and its immediate success is desirable to the COVID-19 hit Central Asian economies. This is because BRI has bound the region together in terms of infrastructural development where China, under the rubric of BRI, is spearheading major developmental projects, pouring investment in energy sector, offering debt, and improving bilateral trade with regional economies. For this reason, the Central Asian countries desire immediate revival of close economic cooperation which could links the economic fortunes of regional countries to Beijing and brings the BRI to the fore in regional priorities.

Methods: The Authors analyzed the characteristics of hand and wrist traumatic disorders during the months of February and March comparing 2019 to 2020. Collected data included age distribution, traumatic etiology, diagnosis and type of surgical procedures. Results: The total number of orthopedic and trauma patients significantly decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 (3360 vs 1470). The number of hand and wrist injuries didn't show a significant difference between 2019 and 2020 instead (192 vs 131).

Here, the NS1 (partial), NP1, VP1 and VP2 gene of the FBoV-2/TUR/2020C14 strain obtained from the study were also sequenced and the nt and aa sequences showed high identities to the above-mentioned FBoV-2 strain/isolates (> 96%, except for the aa ratio of strain 16SY0701). In conclusion, this study shows that FBoV and FeChPV are present in healthy cats in Turkey, and these viruses can be detected from oropharyngeal swabs. Our findings contribute to further investigation of the prevalence, genotype distribution, and genetic diversity of Turkish FBoVs and FeChPVs, adding to the molecular epidemiology of FBoV and FeChPVs worldwide.","output":"First detection of feline bocaparvovirus 2 and feline chaphamaparvovirus in healthy cats in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to determine the effects on knowledge and motivation of animation and gamification in online distance education for a diabetes nursing course.

Surprisingly, we find that an uninfected, virus-immune guinea pig whose body is contaminated with influenza virus can transmit the virus through the air to a susceptible partner in a separate cage. We further demonstrate that aerosolized fomites can be generated from inanimate objects, such as by manually rubbing a paper tissue contaminated with influenza virus.

Understanding jumps is critical for investors because cross-asset diversification is reduced when jumps occur often and are correlated. Results indicate the presence of jumps in all assets. The average correlation between the asset classes is -0.025, indicating that diversifying across asset classes reduces the jump risk to which an investor is exposed. The findings highlight the downside of assessing the advantages of diversification across asset classes solely on the basis of returns. While this can seem to be of little importance, diversification is likely to result in a substantial reduction in jump risk. An analysis of the domestic oil price surge, the gold ban as a payment vehicle under Government Resolution No: 11/NQ-CP, and the Covid-19 pandemic show the benefits of cross-asset diversification from a jump risk standpoint. According to the results, jump correlations do not always have a negative impact on diversification benefits.

Our results indicated that 96% of study participants were vaccinated who had asymptomatic, mild or moderate disease. One unvaccinated individual developed severe disease. The median age of omicron cases was 30 years, and most frequent disease symptoms were: fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, general fatigue and muscle/joint pain. Viral genomic analysis results revealed that the BA.1 is the dominant omicron sublineage in Jordan, with 45 to 58 total mutations.

However, limited basic science and clinical studies have been performed to address the potential disease specific immune-mediated mechanisms causing secondary glomerular pathology, its various types of presentation, and the potential treatments. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man with chronic active rheumatoid arthritis presented with nephrotic syndrome and was found to have membranous nephropathy with eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi on renal biopsy. Proteinuria persisted despite complete withdrawal from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Throughout the disease course, he developed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, both of which achieved clinical resolution with glucocorticoids. However, only partial improvement was observed in proteinuria with treatment of steroids and Rituximab. CONCLUSION: Our case presented a unique and complicated clinical phenotype of active rheumatoid arthritis, with clinical features of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, histopathologic features of membranous and cryoglobulinemic nephropathy in the absence of DMARDs use, as well as pulmonary sarcoidosis. We speculate that there is a wider spectrum of glomerular disease in patients with untreated rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the potential association between rheumatoid arthritis and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis should probably be revisited and requires further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and treatment options.","output":"Case report: a man with untreated rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many college students had their plans go awry when COVID-19 hit and, if they were lucky, they found that one door closing led to another opening.

The random variable considered was the infection rate, also known as the basic reproduction number R0, which fluctuates between 0.5 and 2.5. A dynamic transmission rate and a constant recovery rate were applied in the investigation. An Excel spreadsheet was used, and the data obtained was plotted. The data taken for the simulation was from February 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The result reflected a significant difference between the historical data and the data obtained in the simulation, this due to the behavior of the dynamic variables that indicated an approximate error of 6,600,000. It can also be observed that the infected cases obtained from the simulation maintain a positive slope, therefore, there is the possibility that this variable will continue to grow. It is worth mentioning that for there to be a work suspension, it was considered that the average R0 was greater than 1.79, considering this as an intermediate value when industrial work was suspended in Mexico. The result obtained from the average R0 was 1.43, which promises a considerable decrease in infections and in view of the restriction, it was concluded that there is no new work suspension in Mexico due to COVID-19.

The RT consisted of two parts (increments), in order to disentangle the variability arising from the experimental compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prostate target biopsy (TB) outcomes could be predicted by using artificial intelligence approach based on a set of clinical pre-biopsy. METHODS: Pre-biopsy characteristics in terms of PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE), previous prostate biopsies, number of suspicious lesions at mp-MRI, lesion volume, lesion location, and Pi-Rads score were extracted from our prospectively maintained TB database from March 2014 to December 2019. Our approach is based on Fuzzy logic and associative rules mining, with the aim to predict TB outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1448 patients were included. Using the Frequent-Pattern growth algorithm we extracted 875 rules and used to build the fuzzy classifier. 963 subjects were classified whereas for the remaining 484 subjects were not classified since no rules matched with their input variables.

Samples with triply concordant diagnoses were included in this study, divided into a training set (n = 241) and a test set (n = 92). Both the training and test sets included various representative subclasses of unambiguous nevi and melanomas. A prediction model was developed from the training set using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classification model. RESULTS: We validated the prediction model on the independent test set of 92 specimens (75 classified correctly, two misclassified, and 15 indeterminate). IMS detects melanoma with a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 96.4% when evaluating each unique spot. IMS predicts melanoma at the sample level with a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of 97.5%. Indeterminate results were excluded from sensitivity and specificity calculations. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that IMS-based proteomics results are highly concordant to diagnostic results obtained by careful histopathologic evaluation from a panel of expert dermatopathologists.

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and references of included studies. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently selected studies conducted after 2000 evaluating mortality of older patients ( 75 yr old) admitted to ICU. DATA EXTRACTION General characteristics, mortality rate, and factors independently associated with mortality were extracted independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were solved by discussion within the study team. DATA SYNTHESIS Because of expected heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed. We selected 129 studies (median year of publication, 2015; interquartile range, 2012-2017) including 17 based on a national registry. Most were conducted in Europe and North America. The median number of included patients was 278 (interquartile range, 124-1,068). ICU and in-hospital mortality were most frequently reported with considerable heterogeneity observed across studies that was not explained by study design or location. ICU mortality ranged from 1% to 51%, in-hospital mortality from 10% to 76%, 6-month mortality from 21% to 58%, and 1-year mortality from 33% to 72%. Factors addressed in multivariate analyses were also heterogeneous across studies. Severity score, diagnosis at admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were the independent factors most frequently associated with ICU mortality, whereas age, comorbidities, functional status, and severity score at admission were the independent factors most frequently associated with 3- 6 and 12 months mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this systematic review of older patients admitted to intensive care, we have documented substantial variation in short- and long-term mortality as well as in prognostic factors evaluated. To better understand this variation, we need consistent, high-quality data on pre-ICU conditions, ICU physiology and treatments, structure and system factors, and post-ICU trajectories. These data could inform geriatric care bundles as well as a core data set of prognostic factors to inform patient-centered decision-making.","output":"Mortality of Older Patients Admitted to an ICU: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses that generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates during replication, yet evade detection by host innate immune sensors. Here we report that coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), an endoribonuclease, is required for evasion of dsRNA sensors. We evaluated two independent nsp15 mutant mouse coronaviruses, designated N15m1 and N15m3, and found that these viruses replicated poorly and induced rapid cell death in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Infection of macrophages with N15m1, which expresses an unstable nsp15, or N15m3, which expresses a catalysis-deficient nsp15, activated MDA5, PKR, and the OAS/RNase L system, resulting in an early, robust induction of type I IFN, PKR-mediated apoptosis, and RNA degradation. Immunofluorescence imaging of nsp15 mutant virus-infected macrophages revealed significant dispersal of dsRNA early during infection, whereas in WT virus-infected cells, the majority of the dsRNA was associated with replication complexes. The loss of nsp15 activity also resulted in greatly attenuated disease in mice and stimulated a protective immune response. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that coronavirus nsp15 is critical for evasion of host dsRNA sensors in macrophages and reveal that modulating nsp15 stability and activity is a strategy for generating live-attenuated vaccines.","output":"Coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 mediates evasion of dsRNA sensors and limits apoptosis in macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing novel COVID-19 is spreading all across the globe like wildfire. As was the case with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, several hematological laboratory abnormalities have been identified. Several studies have reported prevalence and mechanism behind COVID-19 patients presenting with thrombocytopenia, however its association with disease severity and mortality is poorly understood. In this study we seek to investigate these clinical outcomes. Methods:Retrospective data on 7597 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was recorded. Data included demographical information, comorbidities, admission laboratory markers, nadir platelet count and time to platelet nadir. Platelet count was categorized as grade 1 (150K-75,001), grade 2 (75K-50,001), grade 3 (50K-25,001), grade 4 (25K-10,001), and grade 5 (<10K). COVID-19 disease severity was defined as mild/moderate (medical floor), severe (ICU), and critical (ICU and ventilator/vasopressor use). In-hospital mortality was also analyzed. Results:Of the 7,597 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 1,226 (16%) patients had some degree of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150K/mm3), while 3524 (46%) did not. No platelet count was available for 2,847 (38%) patients. In patient population with thrombocytopenia, mean age was 67 years and included 486 (40%) female. Variables that had an association with degree of thrombocytopenia with statistical significance included increasing mean age, male sex, increased time to nadir platelet count, and elevated laboratory markers on admission (d-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), monocytes, c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6)). Degree of thrombocytopenia also was associated with increasing COVID-19 disease severity (table 1). Overall, 1,163 (15%) of patients died in hospital or were discharged to hospice care. In multivariate analysis, patients with grade 1 thrombocytopenia were 1.448 times more likely to die that those patients with no thrombocytopenia when controlling for the other variables (p value =0.0004). Similarly, grade 2 were 3.916 times more likely to die (p value <0.0001), grade 3 were 7.736 times more likely to die (p value <0.0001), grade 4 were 34.346 times more likely to die (p value =0.0014), and grade 5 were 108.925 times more likely to die (p value =0.0011). Interestingly, interventions such as steroids use was associated 1.43 times increase in mortality (p value =0.0002), while plasma transfusion was associated with 2.43 times increase in mortality (p value =0.0018) (table 2). Conclusion:Thrombocytopenia is common among patient with COVID-19. We report prevalence of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients to be comparable to other studies (16%). COVID-19 patients with thrombocytopenia were noted to be older compared to patients without thrombocytopenia (67 vs 60 years). As a result, this population may have other comorbidities that make them more vulnerable and susceptible to hematological abnormalities. As expected, most patients were categorized as grade 1 thrombocytopenia (88%) and very few patients had indication for platelet transfusion (grade 5 thrombocytopenia <1 %). Several concurrent abnormal inflammatory laboratory markers point towards consumptive thrombocytopenia in the setting of hyper-inflammatory phase COVID-19. This is consistent with time to nadir platelet count seen in this study- day 3 to 8 with increase in degree of thrombocytopenia. More importantly, we see that thrombocytopenia is associated with increases in disease severity and mortality. The higher the degree of thrombocytopenia the more likely the patient may require ICU level of care and mechanical ventilator support. Overall, we see that COVID-19 patients with thrombocytopenia exhibit worse outcome in terms of disease severity and mortality when compared to patients without thrombocytopenia. The etiology behind this association is still unclear and presents an area for future research.

Materials and methods: The SOM applied in this context does not evaluate which measures applied have helped contain the spread of the disease, but these datasets represent the repercussions of the country's measures, which were implemented to contain the virus' spread. Results: This approach demonstrated that the spread of the disease in Brazil does not have a standard behavior, changing according to the region, state, or city. The analyses showed that cities and states in the north and northeast regions of the country were the most affected by the disease, with the highest number of cases and deaths registered per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: The SOM clustering was able to spatially group cities, states, and regions according to their coronavirus cases, with similar behavior.

Using a representative sample of European banks, we study the distribution of net trading income (normalized by total assets) conditional to changes in key macro-financial risk factors. To map the linkages of net trading income with financial risk factors and capture non-linear effects, we implement a dynamic fixed effects quantile model using the method of moments approach. We use the model to empirically estimate and forecast the conditional net trading income distribution from which we quantify tail risk measures and expected losses across banks. We find a heterogeneous and asymmetric impact of the risk factors on the distribution of net trading income. Credit and interest rate spreads affect lower quantiles of the net trading income distribution while stock returns are an important determinant of the upper quantiles. We also find that the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the 5th and 10th percentile expected capital shortfall. Moreover, adverse scenario forecasts show a wide dispersion of losses and a long-left tail is evident especially in the most severe scenarios.

Data Sources: An electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid/EMBASE and PsycINFO (January 2000CApril 2021). Study Selection: Included were studies that assessed ACT in children with SHCN (ages 0C17y) and/or parents of children with SHCN and had a comparator group. Data Extraction: Descriptive data were synthesized and presented in a tabular format, and data on relevant outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, stress, avoidance and fusion) were used in the meta-analyses to explore the effectiveness of ACT (administered independently with no other psychological therapy) compared to no treatment. Results: Ten studies were identified (child (7) and parent (3)). In children with SHCN, ACT was more effective than no treatment at helping depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = ?4.27, 95% CI: ?5.20, ?3.34; p < 0.001) and avoidance and fusion (SMD = ?1.64, 95% CI: ?3.24, ?0.03; p = 0.05), but not stress.

With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program.

We assessed neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in 44 South African COVID-19 patients either infected with the Beta variant (dominant from November 2020 to May 2021) or infected before its emergence (first wave, Wuhan strain) to provide an overall measure of immune evasion. We show that robust spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were detectable in Beta-infected patients, similar to first-wave patients. Using peptides spanning the Beta-mutated regions, we identified CD4 T cell responses targeting the wild-type peptides in 12 of 22 first-wave patients, all of whom failed to recognize corresponding Beta-mutated peptides. However, responses to mutated regions formed only a small proportion (15.7%) of the overall CD4 response, and few patients (3 of 44) mounted CD8 responses that targeted the mutated regions. Among the spike epitopes tested, we identified three epitopes containing the D215, L18, or D80 residues that were specifically recognized by CD4 T cells, and their mutated versions were associated with a loss of response. This study shows that despite loss of recognition of immunogenic CD4 epitopes, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to Beta are preserved overall. These observations may explain why several vaccines have retained the ability to protect against severe COVID-19 even with substantial loss of neutralizing antibody activity against Beta.","output":"Escape from recognition of SARS-CoV-2 variant spike epitopes but overall preservation of T cell immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article by Clare Brown is based on a presentation given at the BIALL Online Annual Conference in June 2021.

Although hyperoxia can cause acute lung injury due to increased production of superoxide anion (O2-), the choice of high concentration oxygen administration has become a necessity in critical care. Test the hypothesis that UCP2 has a major function of reducing O2- generation in the lung in ambient air or in hyperoxia. Lung epithelial cells, WT, UCP2-/- or Trx-Tg mice were exposed to hyperoxia and O2- generation by EPR, and lung injury was measured by histopathology analysis. UCP2 expression was analyzed using RT-PCR, western analysis, RNA interference. The signal transduction pathways leading to loss of UCP2 expression was analyzed by immunoprecipitation, phosphoprotein analysis and, using specific inhibitors. UCP2 mRNA and protein expression were acutely decreased in hyperoxia, which were associated with significant increase in O2- production in the lung. Treatment of cells with rhTrx or exposure of Trx-Tg mice prevented the loss of UCP2 protein and decreased O2- generation in the lung. Trx is also required to maintain UCP2 expression in normoxia. Loss of UCP2 in UCP2-/- mice accentuated lung injury in hyperoxia. Trx activates MKK4-p38MAPK-PGC1 pathway leading to rescue of UCP2 and decreased O2- generation in hyperoxia.

Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia is associated with postoperative complications and remains common despite the use of effective and safe warming devices. This study aimed to measure the impact of targeted audit and feedback on anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management and subsequent patient outcomes. METHODS This study was a three-arm cluster randomized-controlled trial. Anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management performance was analyzed in two phases. The first was a baseline phase with audit but no feedback for eight months, followed by an intervention phase over the next seven-month period after participants had received interventions according to their randomized group allocation of no feedback (control), benchmarked feedback, or ranked feedback. Anesthesiologists' percentage of hypothermic patients at the end of surgery (primary endpoint) and use of a warming device were compared among the groups. RESULTS Forty-five attending anesthesiologists who took care of 7,846 patients over 15 months were included. The odds of hypothermia (temperature < 36C at the end of surgery) increased significantly from pre- to post-intervention in the control and ranked groups (control odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.56; P = 0.02; ranked OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.56; P = 0.04) but not in the benchmarked group (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.28; P = 0.58). Between-arm differences in pre- to post-intervention changes were not significant (benchmark vs control OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.10; P = 0.19; ranked vs control OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.33, P = 0.94). No significant overall effect on intraoperative warmer use change was detected. CONCLUSION We found no evidence to suggest that audit and feedback, using benchmarked or ranked feedback, is more effective than no feedback at all to change anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management performance.

Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature.

So far, dexamethasone and remdesivir have shown efficacy in adequately powered clinical trials. In addition, passive immunotherapy appears as a promising therapeutic approach, particularly for early stages of the disease in which patients have not yet established their specific immune response. Different anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19. It has been previously shown that the RBD from the viral spike glycoprotein elicits high titers of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 when used as immunogen in horses. In this regard, equine polyclonal antibodies (EpAbs) can represent a practical and efficient source of NAbs. EpAbs are composed of F(ab)'2 fragments generated by pepsin digestion. These fragments retain the bivalent binding capacity of IgG immunoglobulins but lack the constant region (Fc), responsible for serum sickness reactions and Fc-triggered side effects. EpAbs recognize a vast array of epitopes (limiting the risk of viral escape mutations) and tend to develop greater avidity than mAbs for their cognate antigens. In addition, EpAbs are relatively easy to manufacture allowing a fast development and scaling up for a treatment. We have previously described the development and in vitro characterization of a therapeutic based on purified equine anti-RBD F(ab)2 fragments, called INM005. INM005 shows a very high serum neutralization titer against SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a phase 2/3 clinical to test the therapeutic effect of INM005 on COVID-19 patients. Albeit not having reached the primary endpoint, we found clinical improvement of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, particularly those with severe disease. Rate of improvement in at least two categories was statistically significantly higher for INM005 at days 14 and 21 of follow-up. Time to improvement in two ordinal categories or hospital discharge was 142 ( 07) days in the INM005 group and 163 ( 07) days in the placebo group. Subgroup analyses showed a beneficial effect of INM005 over severe patients and in those with negative baseline antibodies. Overall mortality was 69% the INM005 group and 114% in the placebo group. Adverse events of special interest were mild or moderate;no anaphylaxis was reported. Based on these results, ANMAT granted the emergency use approval of INM005 to treat hospitalized COVID-19 severe patients. Following approval, more than 20,000 patients have been treated with INM005.

A dataset of 309 ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma patients with overall survival >90 days from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed. Multiple estimations and clustering methods identified and verified two immune clusters with component differences. Functional analyses pointed out immune-related alterations underlying internal genomic variables potentially.

KaplanCMeier survival and Cox regression analyses among cohorts were performed systematically to evaluate prognostic efficiency among the risk score model and other clinical pathological parameters, establishing a predictive ability independently. Furthermore, this risk score model was compared among identified signatures in previous studies and applied to two external cohorts, showing better prediction performance and generalization ability, and also validated as robust in association with immune cell infiltration in bulk tissues.

Heterogeneity analysis was performed with Chi-square and I(2) test. Pooled analysis was based on fixed effects model, if heterogeneity between the eligible studies was negligible (I(2) < 50%, P > 0.05). In contrast, a random effects model was carried out. The quality of including studies were evaluated by Cochrane assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 1030 articles identified. Altogether, eight articles including 707 infants were included in final analysis based on eligibility criteria. In continuous feeding infants, time to achieving full feeds was longer (weight mean difference 0.98 (95% CI 0.26C1.71, P = 0.008) days) compared with intermittent feeding infants. Pooled analysis indicated there were no significant difference in other variables such as feeding intolerance, duration of hospitalization, days to regain birth weight, days to first successful oral feeding, duration of parenteral feeding, weight growth, length increment, head circumference growth, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, and probable necrotizing enterocolitis.

Methods: Participants with POMS were consecutively recruited from the NYU Langone Pediatric MS Care Center and enrolled to complete a 1-month intervention with use of the Personal Zen ABMT app on their mobile personal device. Feasibility was evaluated by use of the 1-month intervention and efficacy was measured by changes in depression, anxiety, and affect. Results: A total n = 35 patients with POMS were enrolled in the study (M(age) = 17.7, SD = 2.2 years, range 14C23). Feasibility criteria were met with 74% completing the full intervention time, and 100% of the sample completing at least 50% of targeted intervention use. Initial efficacy was found for a reduction in negative affect from baseline to intervention end [M = 22.88, SD = 9.95 vs. M = 19.56, SD = 7.37; t((33)) = 2.47, p = 0.019]. Anxiety also significantly decreased from pre to post-intervention in adults [M = 11.82, SD = 9.90 vs. M = 7.29, SD = 7.17; t((16)) = 3.88, p = 0.001] and youth [M = 51.14, SD = 19.66 vs. M = 40.86, SD = 27.48; t((13)) = 3.17, p = 0.007]. Conclusion: Mobile ABMT with the Personal Zen app is a feasible and accessible digital emotional health tool for patients with POMS and may have broader application for managing distress across chronic neurological conditions.","output":"Mobile Attention Bias Modification Training Is a Digital Health Solution for Managing Distress in Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study in Pediatric Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful approach for reducing expression of endogenously expressed proteins.

(2)GPI monomers and dimers were obtained by fractioned purification and characterized using SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and ELISA. The egg exposure was performed by injection of small volumes of 2.5 g/mL solutions of the (2)GPI subfractions. Angiogenesis was evaluated through quantitative measurements of vascular architecture parameters in the captured CAM images, using computational analysis of texture contrasts and computer vision techniques. Quantitative information was assigned to the CAM vasculature modifications. In vivo, the (2)GPI dimer completely halted the formation of CAM vessels and led to embryo death after 48 h of exposure. The (2)GPI monomer allowed the embryo to develop up to the 10th day, despite early changes of CAM vessels. The impaired normal vessel growth proceeded as a self-limited effect. The (2)GPI monomer-exposed eggs showed reduced vascularization on the 6th day of incubation, but embryos were viable on the 10th day of incubation, with ingurgitated CAM vessels implying sequelae of the angiogenesis inhibition.

The study was conducted on a totality of 185 participants that were divided into three groups. The study group included COVID-19 affected patients (PP n = 80), the first control group included patients with different pathologies (non-COVID-19 NNp n = 62) of the SG Moscati Hospital, and the second control group included healthy individuals (NNh n = 43). The core of the current trial was focused on assessing the level of the vitamin D (serum 25(OH) D concentration), IL-6, and the renal glomerular filtrate (eGFR) in COVID-19 disease and non-COVID-19 patients in both groups. Results: It was observed that the majority of COVID-19-infected patients showed a progressive multi-organ involvement, especially in regard to the lung, kidney, and heart. The majority of the COVID-19 patients exhibited preexisting comorbidities which include cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal disorders accompanied by a severely low level of vitamin D, extremely high level of IL-6, and low glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The significant overall damages exerted by the immune-mediated responses under the hyper-expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins, such as IL-6, may be facilitated by either a decreased level of vitamin D or the ageing process. The reduced presence of vitamin D was often found together with a reduced functionality of renal activity, as revealed by the low eGFR, and both were seen to be concomitant with an increased mortality risk in patients with lung disorders and heart failure (HF), whether it is showed at baseline or it develops during manifestation of COVID-19. Therefore, the documentation of the modifiable risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2 and lung impairment in older patients with kidney and heart disease may help the clinician to better manage the situation.

Thus, in this study, we constructed the co-expression plasmid of CD28-siRNA-PD-1 and explored the anti-tumor mechanism of the co-expression plasmid on mouse model. The results showed that the expression of PD-1 was inhibited and the expression of CD28 was increased significantly in tumor tissues after the mice were treated with the co-expression plasmid. The survival rate of the tumor-bearing mice was recorded every day. PD-1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissues were detected by immunofluorescence staining and the ratios of different immune cells in spleens were detected by flow cytometry. We found that treatment with the co-expression plasmid significantly prolonged the survival of melanoma-bearing mice, induced the cell apoptosis, increased the infiltration of T cells in tumor tissues, and altered the ratios of different immune cells in the spleens. These results also laid the foundation for reducing the resistance of PD-1 blockade in the clinic.","output":"High expression of CD28 enhanced the anti-cancer effect of siRNA-PD-1 through prompting the immune response of melanoma-bearing mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has quickly reached pandemic levels since it was first reported in December 2019. The virus responsible for the disease, named SARS-CoV-2, is enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. During its replication in the cytoplasm of host cells, the viral genome is transcribed into proteins, such as the structural protein spike domain S1, which is responsible for binding to the cell receptor of the host cells. Infected patients have initially flu-like symptoms, rapidly evolving to severe acute lung injury, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by an acute and diffuse inflammatory damage into the alveolar-capillary barrier associated with a vascular permeability increase and reduced compliance, compromising gas exchange and causing hypoxemia. Histopathologically, this condition is known as diffuse alveolar damage which consists of permanent damage to the alveoli epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, with consequent hyaline membrane formation and eventually intracapillary thrombosis. All of these mechanisms associated with COVID-19 involve the phenotypic expression from different proteins transcription modulated by viral infection in specific pulmonary microenvironments. Therefore, this knowledge is fundamentally important for a better pathophysiological understanding and identification of the main molecular pathways associated with the disease evolution. Evidently, clinical findings, signs and symptoms of a patient are the phenotypic expression of these pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, no findings alone, whether molecular, clinical, radiological or pathological axis are sufficient for an accurate diagnosis. However, their intersection and/or correlation are extremely critical for clinicians establish the diagnosis and new treatment perspectives.","output":"Pulmonary pathology of ARDS in COVID-19: A pathological review for clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel and green procedure consisting of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) aided by a commercial cellulase (Celluclast?) has been applied to valorise the apple by-product, a valuable source of dietary fibre but mainly composed by insoluble fibre. Optimal conditions for solubilisation of dietary fibre were first determined at atmospheric pressure as 2% (w/v) of substrate concentration and 20 Endo-Glucanase Units of cellulase. Monitoring of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides released from apple by-product was carried out by means of a newly validated HPLC method with refractive index detector. A synergistic effect was observed when the combined HHP plus cellulase treatment was used. Thus, the application of 200 MPa at 50 C for 15 min enabled a significant increase in the release of water-soluble polysaccharides (1.8-fold) and oligosaccharides (3.8-fold), as well as a considerable decrease in the time required (up to 120-fold), compared to control at 0.1 MPa. Therefore, this technology could be a promising alternative approach to transform an industrial by-product into a novel rich-in-oligosaccharide food ingredient and a step forward into shaping the world of prebiotics.","output":"High Hydrostatic Pressure Assisted by Celluclast?

Understanding which cell types are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether interspecies differences exist, and how variations in cell state influence viral entry is fundamental for accelerating therapeutic and preventative approaches. In this endeavor, we profiled the transcriptome of nine tissues from a Macaca fascicularis monkey at single-cell resolution. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 facilitators, ACE2 and TMRPSS2, in different cell subtypes showed substantial heterogeneity across lung, kidney, and liver. Through co-expression analysis, we identified immunomodulatory proteins such as IDO2 and ANPEP as potential SARS-CoV-2 targets responsible for immune cell exhaustion. Furthermore, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of the kidney unveiled a plausible link between IL6-mediated innate immune responses aiming to protect tissue and enhanced ACE2 expression that could promote viral entry.

Cardiac enzyme (e.g. troponin or creatinine kinase (CK)) elevations are a frequently reported finding, indicating myocardial damage and arrhythmias are the cause for ICU transfer in up to 12% of patients. However, the mechanistic role of COVID19 associated cytokine-storm for the concomitant cardiac dysfunction and associated arrhythmias is unclear. In addition, the role of anti-inflammatory therapy approaches to mitigate this cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. Methods: We investigated the effects of COVID19-associated inflammatory response on cardiac cellular function as well as its cardiac arrhythmogenic potential in rat and induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSc-CM). Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IL1-beta antagonist Canakinumab using state of the art in-vitro confocal and ratiometric high-throughput microscopy. Results: Isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were exposed to control or COVID19 plasma from intensive care unit patients with severe ARDS and impaired cardiac function (LVEF 415%;1/3 of patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;CK 15443 U/l). Cardiomyocytes showed decreased Ca2+ transient amplitudes and altered baseline Ca2+ concentrations leading to impaired cellular contractile function upon electrical field-stimulation and exposure to patient plasma (n=276 control and 359 COVID19 cells;Fura). In addition, we used iPSc-CM to explore the long-term effect of patient plasma on cardiac electrical and mechanical function in a translational setting (24h incubation;Fluo). In iPSc, spontaneous Ca2+ release events (i.e. Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ sparks) were more likely to occur upon incubation with COVID19 plasma and nuclear as well as cytosolic Ca2+ release were altered. Co-incubation with Canakinumab had no effect on pro-arrhythmogenic Ca2+ release or Ca2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling but influenced cellular automaticity upon prolonged electrical stimulation. Conclusion: Plasma derived from COVID19 patients exerts acute cardiodepressant and chronic pro-arrhythmogenic effects in rat and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes.

This study adapted an existing parent training intervention to improve outcomes for low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children with leukemia and pilot tested that intervention for feasibility. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with a focus group of 20 Latino parents of children treated for leukemia. Ten Latino families participated in a pilot study of the adapted parenting intervention, consisting of eight sessions over 6 months. RESULTS Focus groups revealed that parents unanimously supported a parenting intervention but barriers to participation included time constraints, transportation issues, and anxiety in the hospital environment. The parents also highlighted cultural factors that could contribute to the health disparity, such as lack of knowledge and efficacy in facilitating their child's progress with learning and school. In the pilot study, adherence was 90%, establishing feasibility, and the adapted intervention was considered beneficial. The median parenting efficacy scores improved from preintervention to postintervention (median 3.40 vs. 3.94; p < .011), as did parent-reported school functioning of the child (median 50.00 vs. 60.00; p = .088). CONCLUSIONS This study addressed a health disparity by culturally adapting a parenting intervention, which was designed to improve school functioning, to meet the needs and preferences of low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking families of children with leukemia in Southern California.

Detecting biomarkers for COVID-19 using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may aid in drug development and treatment. This research aimed to find blood cell transcripts that represent levels of gene expression associated with COVID-19 progression. Through the development of a bioinformatics pipeline, two RNA-Seq transcriptomic datasets and one microarray dataset were studied and discovered 102 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were shared by three datasets derived from PBMCs. To identify the roles of these DEGs, we discovered disease-gene association networks and signaling pathways, as well as we performed gene ontology (GO) studies and identified hub protein. Identified significant gene ontology and molecular pathways improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and our identified blood-based hub proteins TPX2, DLGAP5, NCAPG, CCNB1, KIF11, HJURP, AURKB, BUB1B, TTK, and TOP2A could be used for the development of therapeutic intervention.

Black women diagnosed with breast cancer are 40 percent more likely to die than their Caucasian peers. They are often diagnosed with higher staged cancers, when treatments are more toxic and costly (Centers for Disease Control, 2018). In addition, Black women have worse stage-specific survival than white women (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures for African Americans 2019-2021). Lack of medical knowledge and social isolation are contributing factors to health care disparities. To address these factors, in fall 2019 a member of the board of directors of Living Beyond Breast Cancer approached LBBC to design an educational program for Black patients newly diagnosed with early-stage and metastatic breast cancer. The overarching program goal was to address health care disparities for Black people. The program aimed to increase knowledge about breast cancer and about the implicit and explicit bias Black patients encounter in health care settings, and to provide tools to address it. The program also prepared patients to be informed partners in their health care and connected them to existing resources and to other Black patients for peer support. Methods. LBBC convened an advisory board of ten Black community leaders with expertise in oncology, health care disparities, social and practical support, and advocacy. Most had a personal history of breast cancer. A consultant with expertise in program development and health disparities was hired to oversee the project. The advisory board met monthly to develop content, format, outreach, and speaker recommendations. Initial plans were to deliver the program as a one-day symposium attached to LBBC's fall conference. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the advisory board decided to offer the program virtually using a combination of live sessions supplemented with video content. Learnings were intended to prepare participants to more effectively communicate with health care professionals and empower them with practical steps to access appropriate care. An evaluation was designed, and participants received an emailprompting them to offer feedback after each session. Results. The program was delivered from September through October 2020. Speakers were Black oncologists, social workers, researchers, and advocates. The first session was an on-demand video offering guidance to recently diagnosed Black breast cancer patients. Three live sessions were delivered weekly on the topics of identifying barriers to accessing care, early-stage breast cancer treatment, and metastatic breast cancer treatment. The last two sessions focused on self-care and advocacy, with the final session delivered at LBBC's virtual fall conference. LBBC registered 436 people from 36 states and Washington, DC, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Participants ranged from age 27 to 83 and lived in urban, suburban, and rural areas. In all, 307 registrants identified as Black, and 40 reported a breast cancer diagnosis in the last six months. Of participants who completed program evaluations, 75 percent reported an increase in knowledge of breast cancer, 77 percent reported increased understanding of treatment, 82 percent reported increased confidence to have conversations with loved ones or health care providers, and 85 percent said they learned strategies to address implicit and explicit bias. An informal assessment of open-field responses demonstrated that attendees valued the programmatic focus on their unique needs as Black breast cancer patients. Conclusions. An educational program led and designed by Black health care professionals and patients can be successfully delivered in a combination live and virtual content format to improve knowledge, communication skills, and feelings of self-efficacy for Black people with breast cancer.","output":"Knowledge is power: Designing an educational program to support black breast cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 started in Region Stockholm, Sweden in December 2020 with those in long-term care facilities or receiving home care vaccinated first followed by those aged over 80 years.

However, little is known about the current involvement, experiences and attitudes of Australian general practitioners towards OSA. The purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth analysis of Australian general practitioners experiences and opinions regarding their care of patients with OSA to inform the design and implementation of new general practice models of care. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants with maximum variation in age, experience and location. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and were analysed using Thematic Analysis. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: (1) General practitioners are important in recognising symptoms of OSA and facilitating a diagnosis by others; (2) Inequities in access to the assessment and management of OSA; and (3) General practitioners currently have a limited role in the management of OSA. CONCLUSIONS: When consulting with patients with symptoms of OSA, general practitioners see their primary responsibility as providing a referral for diagnosis by others. General practitioners working with patients in areas of greater need, such as rural/remote areas and those of socio-economic disadvantage, demonstrated interest in being more involved in OSA management. Inequities in access to assessment and management are potential drivers for change in future models of care for OSA in general practice.","output":"Assessment, referral and management of obstructive sleep apnea by Australian general practitioners: a qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Industrial contaminants and chemicals adversely impact surface water quality and may lead to serious health risks to human and ecosystems. Rivers as one of the major surface water resources receive wastewaters and transport dissolved pollutions in water through Advection-Dispersion processes. A minimum distance known as the mixing length is required for complete mixing and dispersion of the pollutants. Since the concentration of pollutants often exceeds the self-purification capacity of rivers within this distance, reducing it decreases the negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystems. Creating turbulent flows with inherent mixing characteristics is an efficient measure in decreasing the mixing length. Spur dikes that are widely used in river engineering are able to reduce the mixing length by virtue of the turbulence made in a stream. Given the fact that entry of pollutants into the surface water is inevitable and the influence of spur dikes on the characteristics of pollution transport has not been meticulously investigated, this study aimed at the numerical simulation of pollution transport in a rectangular channel adjacent to a spur dike. We thus invoked Flow-3D to simulate flow and transport characteristics around an impermeable and non-submerged rectangular spur dike. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of spur dike effects on pollution transport. Notwithstanding the fact that the spur dike effectively decreased the mixing length of the pollution, the location of the pollutant entry also played a prominent role in reducing the length of this region.","output":"Numerical investigation of pollution transport around a single non-submerged spur dike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The changes accompanying the transition to parenthood, joined by the fears aroused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to high levels of parental anxieties and stress, particularly among parents of young infants.

This study aims to investigate the prevalence of smartphone addiction among freshmen medical students and to explore its association with personal factors, mental health, and professional identity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 10th to November 10th, 2020 and included 2,182 first-year college students at Wannan Medical College, China. The smartphone addiction test, professional identity, and a 12-item general health questionnaire were used for this cross-sectional survey. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) was employed to examine the correlations between smartphone addiction and mental health and professional identity. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the factors influencing smartphone addiction. Of the 2,182 students, 866 (39.7%) were identified as having smartphone addiction. The logistic regression analysis shows that four factors (professional identity scale, poor mental health, smartphone use before sleep, and perceived study pressure) were significantly associated with smartphone addiction. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study suggests that smartphone addiction is common among Chinese freshmen medical students. Smartphone addiction was common among the freshmen medical students surveyed. The findings imply that promotional programs, aimed at enhancing mental health and professional identity among freshmen medical students, help to reduce smartphone addiction in this population.","output":"Smartphone addiction and its associated factors among freshmen medical students in China: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An update on the 2005 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) Consensus Statement on blood donor infectious disease screening was presented at the 2015 ACVIM Forum in Indianapolis, Indiana, followed by panel and audience discussion.

Excessive crowding in homes, dubbed overcrowding, is one measure of quality of life because overcrowding can lead to adverse outcomes such as stunted child development, adverse mental health, and an increased risk in spreading infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This paper makes use of an exogenous increase in the supply of Section 8 housing vouchers in a panel setting to ascertain the effectiveness of a program provided at the federal level in tackling housing overcrowding throughout the nation. Estimation of a linear probability model shows that vouchers reduce the incidence of overcrowding: a 10% increase in the supply of vouchers reduces the likelihood a housing unit is overcrowded by 0.081 percentage points. The mechanism behind the effect is also shown to correspond to anecdotes about overcrowding: households experiencing misfortune, financial difficulties, or similar circumstances double-up with more established households, so that a voucher enables the troubled household to move into more suitable living arrangements.","output":"Housing vouchers reduce residential crowding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel corona virus, named COVID-19, has spread rapidly to other countries like Italy, Iran and South Korea and affected all people, especially health-care providers. Therefore, due to the rapid spread of the disease in Iran, the aim of the present study was to explore psychological distress experienced by Iranian health-care providers in the first few weeks of the corona virus outbreak. METHODS: The present qualitative study was conducted on 18 Iranian health-care providers exposed to COVID ? 19 using a content analysis method. Purposeful sampling was used to select the participants and continued until data saturation was reached. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and then the qualitative data were analyzed through direct content analysis. RESULTS: By analyzing 236 primary codes, two main categories were extracted from the experiences of health-care providers during corona virus outbreak. The first category included Occupational demands with three sub-categories: nature of illness, Organizational demands and social demands. The second category was Supportive resources included personal support and social support. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study found that there were some barriers and challenges to medical personnel exposed to COVID-19 that caused psychological distress.

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as Long COVID syndrome, is the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms long after viral infection. In addition to physical symptoms, those with PASC experience changes in mental health, but few studies have empirically examined these effects. The current study investigated mood and cognitive functioning in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. We recruited 100 male and female adults (M ?= ?30 years old) with no history of mood or cognitive impairment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan. 2020). Half of the subjects were healthy controls (i.e., no prior COVID-19 infection) and half had received a past COVID-19 diagnosis (ascertained by PCR or antibody test) but were no longer infectious. Participants completed self-reported measures of stress, depression, and anhedonia, as well as the Attention Network Test (ANT), a behavioural measure of attentional alerting, orienting and executive functioning. Relative to controls, depression and anhedonia were significantly higher in the past-COVID group. Selective impairment in attention was observed in the past-COVID group, marked by deficits in executive functioning while alerting and orienting abilities remained intact. Effects were most pronounced among individuals diagnosed 1C4 months prior to assessment. There were no group differences in pandemic-related experiences with respect to social interaction, social distancing, or isolation. The past-COVID group scored significantly higher on perceived stress; however, this did not moderate any effects observed on mood or cognition. These findings implicate a protracted reaction to the virus, possibly via prolonged inflammation, contributing to sustained mood dysregulation and cognitive impairment.

The knowledge surrounding the prevalence and determinants of sarcopenia in older medical patients is scarce, and it is unknown whether specific biomarkers can predict physical deconditioning during hospitalisation. We hypothesise that a combination of clinical, functional and circulating biomarkers can serve as a risk stratification tool and can (i) identify older acutely ill medical patients at risk of prolonged hospital stays and (ii) predict changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and function during hospitalisation. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The Copenhagen PROTECT study is a prospective cohort study consisting of acutely ill older medical patients admitted to the acute medical ward at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. Assessments are performed within 24 hours of admission and include blood samples, body composition, muscle strength, physical function and questionnaires. A subgroup of patients transferred to the Geriatric Department are included in a smaller geriatric cohort and have additional assessments at discharge to evaluate the relative change in circulating biomarker concentrations, body composition, muscle strength and physical function during hospitalisation. Enrolment commenced 4 November 2019, and proceeds until August 2021.

METHODS DEFINITIVE LE, a US/European multicenter study, assessed the effectiveness of directional atherectomy using SilverHawk/TurboHawk systems for treatment of peripheral artery disease in the superficial femoral, popliteal, and infrapopliteal arteries. Of the 800 patients enrolled in the study, only the 598 claudicant patients (mean age 69.510.4 years; 336 men) who were classified at baseline as Rutherford category 1-3 were eligible for this subset analysis. Of these, 46.8% (280/598) had diabetes. Follow-up to 12 months included duplex ultrasound examination, functional assessments, and adverse event evaluations. Independent angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories assessed primary patency and secondary endpoints; a clinical events committee adjudicated adverse events. RESULTS Although diabetics had significantly more baseline comorbidities, 12-month primary patency (77.0%) was no different than for nondiabetics (77.9%; superiority p=0.98; noninferiority p<0.001) across all anatomic territories treated. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was no different between diabetics (83.8%) and nondiabetics (87.5%) overall (p=0.19) or by lesion locations. Secondary clinical outcomes (Rutherford category, ankle-brachial index, and walking impairment) improved at 12 months for both diabetics and nondiabetics. CONCLUSION Noninferior 12-month patency rates demonstrate that directional atherectomy is an effective treatment in diabetic as well as nondiabetic claudicants. Directional atherectomy remains an attractive treatment option, improving luminal diameters without stents, which preserves future treatment options for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with progressive, diffuse vascular disease.","output":"A Comparison of Clinical Outcomes for Diabetic and Nondiabetic Patients Following Directional Atherectomy in the DEFINITIVE LE Claudicant Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses comprise a large group of RNA viruses with diverse host specificity. The emergence of highly pathogenic strains like the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the discovery of two new coronaviruses, NL-63 and HKU1, corroborates the high rate of mutation and recombination that have enabled them to cross species barriers and infect novel hosts. For that reason, the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that are effective against several members of this family is highly desirable. This goal can be accomplished by designing inhibitors against a target, such as the main protease 3CL(pro) (M(pro)), which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. Here 3CL(pro) derived from the SARS-CoV was used as the primary target to identify a new class of inhibitors containing a halomethyl ketone warhead. The compounds are highly potent against SARS 3CL(pro) with K(i)'s as low as 300 nM. The crystal structure of the complex of one of the compounds with 3CL(pro) indicates that this inhibitor forms a thioether linkage between the halomethyl carbon of the warhead and the catalytic Cys 145. Furthermore, Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies of these compounds have led to the identification of a pharmacophore that accurately defines the essential molecular features required for the high affinity.","output":"Development of Broad-Spectrum Halomethyl Ketone Inhibitors Against Coronavirus Main Protease 3CL(pro)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to over 1,000,000 deaths worldwide. Hospitals responded by expanding services to accommodate the forecasted rise in COVID-19-related admissions.

METHODS: Data were extrapolated retrospectively from two separate 6-week periods in 2019 and 2020 (1st AprilC13th May) using electronic records of patients referred to the orthopaedic team. Soft tissue injuries were included where a confirmed diagnosis was made with radiological evidence. Patients were excluded if no orthopaedic intervention was required. Data were compared between the two time periods. RESULTS: There were fewer attendances to hospital in 2020 compared with 2019 (178 vs. 328), but time from presentation to surgery significantly increased in 2020 (2.94 days vs. 4.91 days, p = 0.009).

Given the elevated risk of STIs and HIV for African American women, there is an urgent need to identify innovative strategies to enhance adoption and maintenance of STI and HIV preventive behaviors. Texting is a promising technology for creating preventive maintenance interventions (PMIs) that extend the efficacy of the original intervention. However, little guidance in the public health literature is available for developing this type of application. OBJECTIVE: We describe a formative pilot study that incorporates user experience (UX) methods to design and test PMI texts for Afiya, an original evidence-based intervention (EBI) specifically designed for African American adolescent females. The purpose of this study is to describe the adaptation process of the health educator-lead phone calling to text-based communication. METHODS: The formative process followed the ADAPT-ITT framework for adapting EBI and using them in a new setting, for a new target population, or a modified intervention strategy. This study presents the details of how the phases of the ADAPT-ITT framework were applied to the design of the adaptation. An advisory board (AB) from the target population was constituted, consisting of six African American women ages of 18 - 24 years, participating in formative activities for 12 weeks, involving components of the PMI design. As Afiya included a telephone-based PMI, developers of the original Afiya consultation scripts crafted the initial design of the SMS-based text and texting protocol. The AB participated in the one-day Afiya workshop, followed by 4 weeks of texting PMI messages, a mid-course focus group, followed by 4 more weeks of texting PMI messages, ending with a final focus group. At the advisory board's request, this phase included an optional, additional week of text-based PMI messages. RESULTS: The methods provided a rich source of data and insights into the fundamental issue involved when constructing SMS-based PMI for this target population, and for this EBI. Prior contact and context are essential, as the health educator was identified as a key persona in the process and the messages were situated in the original (workshop) context. Narrative adaptations for personas emerged from AB discussions. Suggestions on how to expand the PMI to current, specific social contexts indicated the use of narrative analysis is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: The use of existing EBI incorporating telephone-based PMI scripts facilitated the initial design of the texts, with subsequent narrative analysis of the AB data providing additional adjustments given the actual context. Post-analysis revealed that personas would offer insight and opportunities for persona-specific modification of texting narratives.","output":"Assessing African American Adolescent Texting in Context: Using ADAPT-ITT to modify a telephone-based HIV prevention intervention for SMS-delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing have gained importance in the last few years to obtain atomic structures of drug targets. Obtaining atomic-resolution 3D structure better than ~2.5 ? is a standard approach in pharma companies to design and optimize therapeutic compounds against drug targets like proteins. Protein crystallography is the main technique in solving the structures of drug targets at atomic resolution. However, this technique requires protein crystals which in turn is a major bottleneck. It was not possible to obtain the structure of proteins better than 2.5 ? resolution by any other methods apart from protein crystallography until 2015. Recent advances in single-particle cryo-EM and 3D image processing have led to a resolution revolution in the field of structural biology that has led to high-resolution protein structures, thus breaking the cryo-EM resolution barriers to facilitate drug discovery. There are 24 structures solved by single-particle cryo-EM with resolution 2.5 ? or better in the EMDataBank (EMDB) till date. Among these, five cryo-EM 3D reconstructions of proteins in the EMDB have their associated coordinates deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB), with bound inhibitor/ ligand. Thus, for the first time, single-particle cryo-EM was included in the structure-based drug design (SBDD) pipeline for solving protein structures independently or where crystallography has failed to crystallize the protein. Further, this technique can be complementary and supplementary to protein crystallography field in solving 3D structures. Thus, single-particle cryo-EM can become a standard approach in pharmaceutical industry in the design, validation, and optimization of therapeutic compounds targeting therapeutically important protein molecules during preclinical drug discovery research.

The evaluation of PIK3CA gene mutations was performed by real-time PCR for four mutations (H1047L; E542K, E545K, and E545D). Thirty-seven cases were found to harbour PIK3CA mutations (39%), with the E545D mutation (73%) more frequently detected. There were no significant associations between the mutational status and HPV status (74% WT and 68% MUT were HPV (+); p = 0.489) or overall survival (OS) (3-year OS: WT 54% and MUT 65%; p = 0.090). HPV status was the only factor significantly associated with both OS and disease-free survival (DFS), with HPV (+) patients having consistently better outcomes (3-year OS: HPV (+) 65% and HPV (-) 36%; p = 0.007; DFS HPV (+) 83% and HPV (-) 43%; p = 0.001).

Further, we chose 25 important molecular signatures as potential biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity. The prediction power was validated using corresponding urine samples and plasma samples from new COVID-19 patient cohort, with AUC reached to 0.904 and 0.988, respectively. In conclusion, our omics data proposed not only potential therapeutic targets, but also biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.","output":"Multi-platform omics analysis reveals molecular signature for COVID-19 pathogenesis, prognosis and drug target discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on cardiac surgery patients. Significant reductions in access to surgical treatment have forced surgeons to prioritise patients and follow strict COVID-19 protocols to protect surgeons, staff, and patients.(1) Nosocomial infections among Cardiac Surgery patients have been reported and are associated with a high mortality.(2) As a COVID-19 tertiary care centre and a tertiary cardiac centre, we tried to balance the need to operate on urgent cardiac cases while protecting patients and staff from COVID-19. During the first wave of the pandemic, a total of 579 surgeries were performed. We report findings from an outbreak of four nosocomial infections. All patients tested negative within 24 hours of surgery or admission. Three patients were positive following surgery, suggesting an overall nosocomial rate during the first wave of 0.5% (3/579). One patient admitted for evaluation tested positive during mass screening. Two of the four patients died following respiratory complications. No healthcare worker (HCW) or family member with direct contact with these patients tested positive for COVID-19. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection is uncommon when adhering to safety protocols. Although uncommon, the mortality rate is high (50%) in our series.

Recreational noise pollution, especially unpredictable and intermittent sounds, and its effects on wildlife and biodiversity have been poorly studied. Researchers have paid very little attention to the effect of noisy traditional festivals (fireworks and powder-guns). This study aimed to explore the effect of these recreational activities on the juvenile productivity of an urban avian bioindicator: the house sparrow. We studied five pairs of localities in the Valencia Region (E Spain) with noisy traditional festivals. Each pair was composed of one locality with festivals during the breeding season and the closest similar locality, but with festivals outside the reproductive period (controls). Both locality types were sampled twice each spring (May-June of 2019 and 2020). Sampling dates were selected as 15 and 30 days after noisy festivals ended, while the control localities were sampled 1 day after the census of their correspondent town pair with noisy breeding season festivals. The ratio of the juveniles/adults detected during surveys in the influence area of festivals (100-m buffer around the parades route) was used as a house sparrow breeding success proxy. Data were analysed using GLMM: year (2019/2020), festivals season (breeding/non-breeding), survey (15/30 days), and their interactions were included as fixed factors. Pair of localities and locality nested within the pair were random factors. In 2019, juvenile productivity was lower in the towns with noisy traditional festivals during the breeding season than in the control towns. The 2020 festivals were cancelled due to COVID-19. In spring 2020, house sparrow juvenile productivity was the same in both town groups.

This study examined the impact of COVID-19 response measures on changes in violence against women and children (VAWC) service utilisation across European countries. Methods: : A rapid assessment design was used to compile data including: a survey distributed across WHO Europe Healthy Cities Networks and Violence Injury Prevention Focal Points in WHO European Region member states;and, a scoping review of media reports, journal articles and reports. Searches were conducted in English and Russian and covered the period between 1 January 2020 and 17 September 2020. Data extracted included: country;violence type;service sector;and change in service utilisation during COVID-19. All data pertained to the period during which COVID-19 related public health measures were implemented compared to a period before restrictions were in place. Results: : Overall, findings suggested that there was a median reported increase in VAWC service utilisation of approximately 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Crucially however, change in service utilisation differed across sectors. After categorising each estimate as reflecting an increase or decrease in VAWC service utilisation, there was a significant association between sector and change in service utilisation;the majority of NGO estimates (95.1%) showed an increase in utilisation, compared to 58.2% of law enforcement estimates and 42.9% of health and social care estimates. Conclusions: : The variation across sectors in changes in VAWC service utilisation has important implications for policy makers in the event of ongoing and future restrictions related to COVID-19 and more generally during other times of prolonged presence in the home. The increased global attention on VAWC during the pandemic should be used to drive forward the agenda on prevention, increase access to services, and implement better data collection mechanisms to ensure the momentum and increased focus on VAWC during the pandemic is not wasted.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 and Associated Measures On Health, Police and Non-Government Organisation Service Utilisation Related to Violence Against Women and Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine stimulates the humoral response.Our study aimed to compare the intensity of the humoral immune response, measured bySARS-CoV-2 IgG, SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and S-RBD neutralizing IgG antibody levels, afterCOVID-19 vaccination versus after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted online, using the AUDIT-C questionnaire for alcohol use, the Fagerstr?m Test for Nicotine Dependence, and qualitative questions about alcohol, tobacco, cannabis use and gambling. Results were analyzed using the SPSS v.26 software. Results: Of N = 1365 responders, 300 abstained completely. During lockdown: 43.7% of alcohol users reported drinking less or abstain, followed by a lower mean score in AUDIT-C (p &lt; 0.001), 1/3 of tobacco smokers reported that they smoked more, confirmed by a difference in Fagerstrom Test scores (p &lt; 0.001). 67.4% of cannabis users reported abstinence and 71.4% of gamblers answered that they played less or not at all (females &gt; males, p = 0.031).

RESULTS In all patients, age 65 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60, p = 0.012), operation time 300 min (OR: 3.05, p = 0.013) and thickness of transected pancreas (OR: 1.37, p < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for clinically relevant PF. A receiver operating curve analysis revealed the optimum cut-off values of thickness to be 14 mm with stapler closure and 17 mm with the clamp-crushing method. There were no significant differences regarding PF between the stapler closure and clamp-crushing methods in the thin (<14 mm) and very thick pancreas (17 mm) groups (p = 0.822, p = 0.072). In contrast, stapler closure was the only independent risk factor for developing PF in the moderately thick (14, <17 mm) pancreas group (OR: 6.75 and p = 0.004, respectively).

Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) decreases sympathetic renal efferent and afferent nerve activity. METHODS Obese spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs-ob) were subjected to RDN at the age of 34 weeks (SHRs-ob + RDN) and were compared with sham-operated SHRs-ob and their normotensive lean controls (Ctrs). Blood pressure was measured by telemetry. Kidney and heart function were determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Renal and cardiac remodeling were characterized by immunohistochemical analyses. Animals were killed at the age of 48 weeks. RESULTS In SHRs-ob, RDN attenuated the progressive increase in blood pressure and preserved a mean blood pressure of 1567mm Hg compared with 2208mm Hg in sham-operated SHRs-ob at 100 days after RDN, whereas heart rate, body weight, and metabolic parameters remained unchanged. Renal catecholamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were significantly reduced after RDN, suggesting effective renal denervation. Progression of renal dysfunction as characterized by increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and reduced glomerular filtration rate were attenuated by RDN. In SHRs-ob, renal perfusion was significantly reduced and normalized by RDN. Cardiac fibrosis and cardiac diastolic dysfunction measured by MRI and invasive pressure measurements were significantly attenuated by RDN. CONCLUSIONS In SHRs-ob, progressive increase in blood pressure and progression of renal injury and cardiac remodelling are mediated by renal sympathetic activation as they were attenuated by RDN.","output":"Progression of kidney injury and cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats: the role of renal sympathetic innervation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The systematic identification of host genetic risk factors is essential for the understanding and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS In this multicenter, IVT-registry-based study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, ECASS-II definition), 3-month mortality and 3-month functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching and inverse probability weighted analyses. RESULTS Among 10,074 IVT-treated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher NIHSS and glucose on admission and more often female sex, prior stroke and prior functional dependence than non-SaO patients.

Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance.

From January 1 to December 23, 2019, a total of 46 patients with chronic sinus tract wounds, who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the Wound Healing Center of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, including 23 males and 23 females, aged 18-81 (4821) years. On admission, computer tomography (CT) imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to examine the shapes of wound sinus tract and classify the wounds, and the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by CT imaging (hereinafter referred to as reference lengths) were recorded; the lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds were examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy and measured. The wounds with and without obviously curved sinus tract were classified into curve group and straight group respectively, and the deviation rates between the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy or hard endoscopy and the reference lengths (hereinafter referred to as deviation rates of lengths) in each group were calculated and compared. The differences between the deviation rates of lengths examined by soft endoscopy and hard endoscopy and the deviation rate of reference lengths (0) in each group were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. Results: CT imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that there were 4 types of wound sinus tract, including tubular (36/46), lamellar (4/46), club-mallet (4/46), and irregular (2/46). Tubular wounds were further divided into type I (23/36), type L (4/36), and type Y (9/36). Wounds with type I tubular, lamellar, and club-mallet sinus tract were classified into linear group (31/46), while those with type Y tubular, type L tubular, and irregular sinus tract were classified into curve group (15/46). In linear group, the deviation rates of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy were 0. In curve group, the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by soft endoscopy was 0 (0, 0.58%), which was significantly lower than 41.18% (31.68%, 48.41%) examined by hard endoscopy, Z=-3.408, P<0.01; the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy (4019)% was significantly higher than the deviation rate of reference lengths (t=8.343, P<0.01), while the deviation rate of the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy was similar to the deviation rate of reference lengths (Z=-1.342, P>0.05). Conclusions: Compared with hard endoscopy, soft endoscopy can observe the internal characteristics of chronic sinus tract wounds in a wider range in the clinical examination of this kind of wound, especially for the exploration of curved chronic sinus tract wounds. The promotion of this method will be conducive to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic sinus tract wounds.","output":"[Application value of soft endoscopy and hard endoscopy in the clinical examination of chronic sinus tract wounds with different shapes]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Teleconsultation has been widely utilised during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CLE lesions can have signs of skin damage including dyspigmentation, scarring, atrophy and/or alopecia. Disease damage secondary to CLE can be cosmetically disfiguring and causes patients significant distress. While many current treatments for CLE focus primarily on reducing inflammation, there are few options for managing disease damage. Providers currently lack strong guidance on managing CLE damage due to the paucity of literature on this topic. Because of this knowledge gap, we aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about the pathogenesis and management of signs of disease damage in CLE. METHODS: In this narrative review, Pubmed, Ovid Medline, and Google scholar were searched for relevant articles assessing pathogenesis and treatment of disease damage. RESULTS: Therapeutic options for CLE damage, including hyperpigmentation (laser and camouflage), hypopigmentation (melanocyte grafting and camouflage), scarring (laser, dermabrasion and camouflage), atrophy (filler, fat transplantation and flap procedures) and scarring alopecia (hair transplantation and camouflage) were identified. We found that investigations of therapeutics for CLE disease damage primarily consist of case reports and small case series. Reported adverse events due to treatment for CLE disease damage range from temporary erythema and discomfort to disease reactivation and pigmentary defects. CONCLUSIONS: There are various treatments for disease damage for each sign of disease damage.

However, there is a lack of applications that can offer accurate predictions of asthma exacerbation using the weather triggers and demographic characteristics to give tailored response to users. This paper proposes an optimised Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model to predict asthma exacerbation based on personalised weather triggers. Methods C With the aim of integrating weather, demography, and asthma tracking, an mHealth application was developed where users conduct the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to identify the chances of their asthma exacerbation. The asthma dataset consists of panel data from 10 users that includes 1010 ACT scores as the target output. Moreover, the dataset contains 10 input features which include five weather features (temperature, humidity, air-pressure, UV-index, wind-speed) and five demography features (age, gender, outdoor-job, outdoor-activities, location). Results C Using the DNNR model on the asthma dataset, a score of 0.83 was achieved with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)=1.44 and Mean Squared Error (MSE)=3.62. It was recognised that, for effective asthma self-management, the prediction errors must be in the acceptable loss range (error<0.5). Therefore, an optimisation process was proposed to reduce the error rates and increase the accuracy by applying standardisation and fragmented-grid-search. Consequently, the optimised-DNNR model (with 2 hidden-layers and 50 hidden-nodes) using the Adam optimiser achieved a 94% accuracy with MAE=0.20 and MSE=0.09. Conclusions C This study is the first of its kind that recognises the potentials of DNNR to identify the correlation patterns among asthma, weather, and demographic variables. The optimised-DNNR model provides predictions with a significantly higher accuracy rate than the existing predictive models and using less computing time. Thus, the optimisation process is useful to build an enhanced model that can be integrated into the asthma self-management for mHealth application.","output":"Optimised deep neural network model to predict asthma exacerbation based on personalised weather triggers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To establish and promote the non-contact doctor-patient interactive diagnosis and treatment mode based on mobile internet for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with moxibustion therapy, and to observe the feasibility and effectiveness of the model in the pandemic.

At present we have neither medicine nor vaccine to prevent this pandemic. Lockdowns, curfews, isolations, quarantines, and social distancing are the only ways to mitigate their infection. This is badly affecting the mental health of people. Hence, there is an urgent need to address this issue. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel Betacorona virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which has emerged in the city of Wuhan in China and declared a pandemic by WHO since it affected almost all the countries the world, infected 24,182,030 people and caused 825,798 death as per data are compiled from John Hopkins University (JHU). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive (+) sense RNA of a30a?kb nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence similarity (a79 %) with SARS-CoV. Envelope and nucleocapsids are two evolutionary conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 having a sequence identity of about 96 % and 89.6 %, respectively as compared to SARS-CoV. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Transmission of this virus in the human occurs through the respiratory tract and decreases the respiration efficiency of lungs. Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation period of 2-14 days. The virus first infects the lower airway and bind with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of alveolar epithelial cells. Due to the unavailability of drugs or vaccines, it is very urgent to design potential vaccines or drugs for COVID-19. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic play an important role in designing potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The suitable vaccine selects for SARS-CoV-2 based on binding energy between the target protein and the designed vaccine. The stability and activity of the designed vaccine can be estimated by using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. This review mainly focused on the brief up to date information about COVID-19, molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathways involved during COVID-19 infection. It also covers potential vaccine design against COVID-19 by using various computational approaches.

In this report, we described a COVID-19-positive case who had COVID-related complications and iatrogenic left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm after central venous catheter insertion. Case Presentation. A 58-year-old male patient presented with a high-grade fever, myalgia, and shortness of breath due to COVID-19 infection. He required mechanical ventilation support and hemodialysis. He also developed uneventful deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction. As a complication of central line insertion, the patient developed pseudoaneurysm that originated from the subclavian artery with significant bleeding and large hematoma. Balloon-assisted percutaneous thrombin injection was done under ultrasound guidance. The patient was extubated 2 days later with no evidence of flow in the pseudoaneurysm. However, he lost movement in the left arm secondary to the compression of the brachial plexus from the pseudoaneurysm/hematoma, and therefore, 1.5 litres of the hematoma was evacuated in the operating room through a lateral left chest wall incision along the anterior axillary line to relieve the compression over the brachial plexus. The patient declined surgical reconstruction of the brachial plexus, and the flaccid paralysis of the arm did not recover during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is a case of unusual complications of COVID infection and iatrogenic left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm postcentral vein cannulation.

Although telehealth has the potential to improve access to mental health care, telehealths effectiveness for suicide-related outcomes remains relatively unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the escalated distribution of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VAs) video-enabled tablets during the COVID-19 pandemic and rural veterans mental health service use and suicide-related outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included rural veterans who had at least 1 VA mental health care visit in calendar year 2019 and a subcohort of patients identified by the VA as high-risk for suicide. Event studies and difference-in-differences estimation were used to compare monthly mental health service utilization for patients who received VA tablets during COVID-19 with patients who were not issued tablets over 10 months before and after tablet shipment. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2021 to February 2022. EXPOSURE: Receipt of a video-enabled tablet. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mental health service utilization outcomes included psychotherapy visits, medication management visits, and comprehensive suicide risk evaluations (CSREs) via video and total visits across all modalities (phone, video, and in-person). We also analyzed likelihood of emergency department (ED) visit, likelihood of suicide-related ED visit, and number of VAs suicide behavior and overdose reports (SBORs). RESULTS: The study cohort included 13 180 rural tablet recipients (11 617 [88%] men; 2161 [16%] Black; 301 [2%] Hispanic; 10 644 [80%] White; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [13.4] years) and 458 611 nonrecipients (406 545 [89%] men; 59 875 [13%] Black or African American; 16 778 [4%] Hispanic; 384 630 [83%] White; mean [SD] age, 58.0 [15.8] years). Tablets were associated with increases of 1.8 psychotherapy visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.17), 3.5 video psychotherapy visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.27-0.31), 0.7 video medication management visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.055-0.062), and 0.02 video CSREs per year (monthly coefficient, 0.002; 95% CI, 0.002-0.002). Tablets were associated with an overall 20% reduction in the likelihood of an ED visit (proportion change, ?0.012; 95% CI, ?0.014 to ?0.010), a 36% reduction in the likelihood of suicide-related ED visit (proportion change, ?0.0017; 95% CI, ?0.0023 to ?0.0013), and a 22% reduction in the likelihood of suicide behavior as indicated by SBORs (monthly coefficient, ?0.0011; 95% CI, ?0.0016 to ?0.0005). These associations persisted for the subcohort of rural veterans the VA identifies as high-risk for suicide. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of rural US veterans with a history of mental health care use found that receipt of a video-enabled tablet was associated with increased use of mental health care via video, increased psychotherapy visits (across all modalities), and reduced suicide behavior and ED visits. These findings suggest that the VA and other health systems should consider leveraging video-enabled tablets for improving access to mental health care via telehealth and for preventing suicides among rural residents.","output":"Mental Health Service Use, Suicide Behavior, and Emergency Department Visits Among Rural US Veterans Who Received Video-Enabled Tablets During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimers disease (AD), and idiopathic Parkinsons disease (IPD) are the neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Cognitive impairment is on the forefront in AD. However, IPD is a movement disorder. Inflammation was suggested to have an effect in the pathophysiology of these two diseases. NeutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR) was shown to be a possible marker showing the peripheral inflammation. We aimed to investigate the NLR of patiens with the diagnosis of AD, and IPD, and individuals with no neurodegenerative disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients with the diagnosis of IPD, and 94 with diagnosis of AD, and 61 healthy controls were included into the study. All the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were retrospectively obtained from the hospital automated database system. RESULTS: The NLR in the IPD group was found statistically significantly higher compared with the control group and the AD group (p < 0.001, p = 0.04, respectively). The age-adjusted values were statistically analyzed because of age difference. No statistically significant difference was detected between AD and control groups in terms of NLR (p = 0.6). The age-adjusted NLR value in the Parkinsons group was found significantly higher compared to the control group (p = 0.02) and Alzheimers group (p = 0.03). DISCUSSION: Chronic inflammation has an important role in the emergence and progression of the chronic neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS.

Data regarding clinical profile of hospitalised elderly with COVID-19 in Indonesia were still lacking. Older people are at-risk population in the pandemic, whom we should pay attention to.MethodsThis single centre descriptive study utilised complete data of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in Indonesia's national general hospital from April to late August 2020. The data consisted of clinical characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, multimorbidity, and mortality outcome.ResultsAmong elderly patients (n=44), a majority of patients were aged 60-69 years (68%), were male (66%), and had no history of close contact with COVID-19 patient (86%). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath (classic symptoms of COVID-19), whereas the most common chronic diseases were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy. Multimorbidity was only found in 14% of patients, all of whom remained alive following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death rate among elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in this study was 23%, and male older adults contributed to 90% of death cases.ConclusionMale patients dominated both confirmed cases and death cases among elderly with COVID-19. Classic symptoms of COVID-19 were only found in about half of the study patients. Non-survivors had higher percentage of the classic symptoms of COVID-19 than survivors. Atypical COVID-19 presentations are possible in older adults. We postulated that immunosenescence and sex-specific immunoregulatory function play an important role in causing death in this study cohort.

This is partly due to the lack of clinical presentation during the early stages of primary infection and the elusive nature of BLV transmission. This study sought to validate a near-complete genomic sequencing approach for reliability and accuracy before determining its efficacy in characterizing the sequence identity of BLV proviral genomes collected from a pilot study made up of 14 animals from one commercial dairy herd. These BLV-infected animals were comprised of seven adult dam/daughter pairs that tested positive by ELISA and qPCR. The results demonstrate sequence identity or divergence of the BLV genome from the same samples tested in two independent laboratories, suggesting both vertical and horizontal transmission in this dairy herd.

However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers.

The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197-5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344-3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.

Over the past 30 years, the PCs have had great translational applications, but the physiological roles of PC7, the seventh member of the family, are still obscure. Searching for new substrates of PC7, a quantitative proteomics screen for selective enrichment of N-glycosylated polypeptides secreted from hepatic HuH7 cells identified two human type-II transmembrane proteins of unknown function(s): Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 4 (CASC4) and Golgi Phosphoprotein of 130 kDa (GPP130/GOLIM4). Concentrating on CASC4, its mutagenesis characterized the PC7/Furin-shedding site to occur at KR(66)NS, in HEK293 cells. We defined PC7 and Furin trafficking and activity, and demonstrated that CASC4 shedding occurs in acidic endosomes and/or in the trans-Golgi Network. Our data unraveled a cancer-protective role for CASC4, because siRNA silencing of endogenous CASC4 expression in the invasive triple-negative breast cancer human cell line MDA-MB-231 resulted in a significantly increased cellular migration and invasion. Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing CASC4 exhibited reduced migration and invasion, which can be explained by an increased number of paxillin-positive focal adhesions. This phenotypic cancer-protective role of CASC4 is reversed in cells overexpressing an optimally PC7/Furin-cleaved CASC4 mutant, or upon overexpression of the N-terminally convertase-generated membrane-bound segment. This phenotype was associated with increased formation of podosome-like structures, especially evident in cells overexpressing the N-terminal fragment. In accord, breast cancer patients data sets show that high CASC4 and PCSK7 expression levels predict a significantly worse prognosis compared to high CASC4 but low PCSK7 levels. In conclusion, CASC4 shedding not only disrupts its anti-migratory/invasive role, but also generates a membrane-bound fragment that drastically modifies the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in an enhanced cellular migration and invasion. This phenotype might be clinically relevant in the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","output":"Shedding of cancer susceptibility candidate 4 by the convertases PC7/furin unravels a novel secretory protein implicated in cancer progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A primary question in dengue virus (DENV) biology is the molecular strategy for recruitment of host cell protein synthesis machinery. Here, we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV plus- and minus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translation capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV plus-strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV plus-strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV plus-strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likely cis encoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely, the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication while minimizing the activation of antiviral and proteostatic stress response pathways.IMPORTANCE DENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER-compartmentalized life cycle; thus, targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Dengue Virus Selectively Annexes Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Translation Machinery as a Strategy for Co-opting Host Cell Protein Synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phosphothreonine antibody was used to explore reversible thylakoid protein phosphorylation in vivo in evolutionally divergent organisms with oxygenic photosynthesis.

Asymptomatic cases are common and so it is difficult to accurately identify infected cases to support surveillance and case detection. Diagnostic test developers are working to meet the global demand for accurate and rapid diagnostic tests to support disease management. However, the focus of many of these has been on molecular diagnostic tests, and more recently serologic tests, for use in primarily high-income countries. Low- and middle-income countries typically have very limited access to molecular diagnostic testing due to fewer resources. Serologic testing is an inappropriate surrogate as the early stages of infection are not detected and misdiagnosis will promote continued transmission. Detection of infection via direct antigen testing may allow for earlier diagnosis provided such a method is sensitive. Leading SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers include spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, envelope protein, and membrane protein. This research focuses on antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein due to the number of monoclonal antibodies that have been developed for therapeutic research but also have potential diagnostic value. In this study, we assessed the performance of antibodies to the spike glycoprotein, acquired from both commercial and private groups in multiplexed liquid immunoassays, with concurrent testing via a half-strip lateral flow assays (LFA) to indicate antibodies with potential in LFA development. These processes allow for the selection of pairs of high-affinity antispike antibodies that are suitable for liquid immunoassays and LFA, some of which with sensitivity into the low picogram range with the liquid immunoassay formats with no cross-reactivity to other coronavirus S antigens. Discrepancies in optimal ranking were observed with the top pairs used in the liquid and LFA formats.

This study aims to investigate whether wearing an FPP3/PPE during work in the intensive care unit (ICU) affects the blood saturation (SpO2), the heart rate (HR), and the well-being of HCWs, as depicted by a score scale.MethodsThe study included a group of 21 volunteers, staff nurses, students and consultants (including 16 females (76%), with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range 21-27), range 20-59 years).We applied a counterbalanced crossover designa self-controlled trial. Each subject served as his own control and performed the test two times: they wore the FFP3/PPE for a three-hour shift in the ICU and then did not wear the FFP3/PPE for 3 hours. To record the SpO2 and HR in real time, we used a Nellcor PM10N (Coviden, USA) portable monitoring system. Additionally, every 30 minutes during the shift and control run, each subject completed a questionnaire concerning their well-being, with a score scale to evaluate for headaches, shortness of breath, perspiration, fatigue, and thirst.ResultsThe mixed model demonstrated that working with an FFP3/PPE compared to not working with an FFP3/PPE caused a significant, but still within normal ranges, influence on the level of SpO2, with a mean decrease of -1.43%. The highest reduction in the SpO2 was 2.29%, and occurred after 150 minutes of work. We also found a significant increase in the HR at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after starting work.

The dental management of children has become even more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of Turkish pediatric dentists who have been providing dental treatments to children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: After receiving ethical approval, this cross-sectional study was conducted using the Google Forms online survey instrument. An online questionnaire link was sent to all the members of the Turkish Society of Paediatric Dentistry by e-mail and through social media. Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test; a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 200 pediatric dentists participated in this study and most of them (82%) only performed emergency dental treatments, whereas 18.5% performed both emergency and routine dental practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority (72.5%) of pediatric dentists prescribed antibiotics and analgesics to their patients who were not cooperative with non-pharmacological behavior management techniques. The findings of the current study showed that the Turkish pediatric dentists had a good level of knowledge about COVID-19, satisfactorily conducted most of the infection control measures before and after the dental treatments, and attached importance to the use of PPEs; however, infection control measures during the dental treatments could be implemented better. Conclusions: Along with all precautions, the vaccination of healthcare workers and requesting a recent test result from patients showing a lack of COVID-19 disease before dental appointments could be used as effective infection control measures. Additionally, pediatric dentists should continue to follow local and universal guidelines, and education programmes should be frequently implemented in order to keep their COVID-19 management strategies up to date.","output":"Clinical Experience, Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice of Turkish Pediatric Dentists during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responsible tourism implies that all actors involved in tourism take responsibility for their actions The concept of responsible tourism has been extensively addressed in tourism research and practice However, studies analyzing the tourists contribution to responsible tourism have been neglected Considering that tourists have the potential to contribute to economic, environmental socio-cultural, and institutional sustainability, this study focuses on the role tourists can play in responsible tourism It also examines how responsible behavior among tourists has been triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic Thus, drawing on a planned behavior perspective by concentrating on the tourist contribution to sustainable tourism, responsible tourism behavior is investigated by means of 19 semi-structured interviews The study found that tourists are not only sensitive to sustainability but that they also behave responsibly both on site and in their travel choices At the same time, tourists pass the buck to suppliers and providers by requesting rules, information and opportunities for responsible tourism to be created In this regard, implications for theory and practice can be derived by informing suppliers and providers about their requested responsibilities, as well as by adding a crisis perspective to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)","output":"Exploring the Role of Tourists: Responsible Behavior Triggered by the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have mental health implications for both people with neurocognitive disorder and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS: The study included caregivers of patients with mild (Na=a13) and major (Na=a54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS: Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (pa=a0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (pa< a0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (pa=a0.003) and avoidance symptoms (pa=a0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (pa=a0.022).

Because tegafur-uracil is effective on cancers with LVI, we conducted a multi-center single-arm phase II study to estimate the efficacy of adjuvant tegafur-uracil in patients with LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC. METHODS Patients with completely resected LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC were registered. LVI was diagnosed by consensus of two of three pathologists. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 2 years of oral tegafur-uracil at 250 mg/m2/day. Fifty-five patients from 7 institutions were enrolled from June 2007 to September 2012. RESULTS Among the 52 eligible patients, 36 (69.2%) completed the treatment course. There were 39 male and 13 female patients. The observation period was calculated as 562 to 3107 days using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. The 5-year overall and relapse free survival rates were 94.2 and 88.5% respectively, which were significantly better than that of any other studies conducted on patients with LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC. Notably, the overall survival rate was 15% better than that of our prior retrospective study. The retrospective analysis of stage IA NSCLC patients who had received an operation in the same period revealed that the 5-year overall survival rate of the LVI positive group was 73.6% when adjuvant chemotherapy was not applied. Among 55 safety analysis sets, 4 cases of grade 3 hepatic function disorder (9.1%) and 5 cases of grade 2 anorexia (10.9%) were most frequently observed. No grade 4 adverse effects were encountered. CONCLUSION A 2-year course of oral tegafur-uracil administration is feasible and might have a significant benefit in the adjuvant treatment of LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC.

We evaluate the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected preeclamptic women. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the potential of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), dolutegravir (DTG) and remdesivir (RDV) in drug repurposing and their safety in pregnancy complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In HIV infection, the trans-activator of transcription protein, which has homology with vascular endothelial growth factor, impairs angiogenesis, leading to endothelial injury and possible PE development despite neutralization of their opposing immune states. Markers of ED show strong evidence supporting the adverse role of ART in PE development and mortality compared to treatment-na?ve pregnancies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) to induce ED and hypertension, thereby mimicking angiotensin II-mediated PE in severe cases of infection. Upregulated ACE 2 in pregnancy is a possible risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PE development. The potential effectiveness of LPV/r against COVID-19 is inconclusive; however, defective decidualization, along with elevated markers of ED, was observed. Therefore, the safety of these drugs in HIV-positive pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 requires attention. Despite the observed endothelial protective properties of DTG, there is a lack of evidence of its effects on pregnancy and COVID-19 therapeutics.

Vaccination may have a negative impact on the reproductive organs and tissues due to the development of an autoimmune process involving the gonads. Currently, there are some studies on the effect of vaccination against coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV2 on the male and female reproductive function. The absence of a negative effect of vaccination on spermatogenesis in men has already been demonstrated in the results of three studies. Objective. To evaluate the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine on spermatogenesis and the level of antiphospholipid antibodies in men. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 45 men who were vaccinated against COVID-19 with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V). The criteria for inclusion in the study were the age from 18 to 55 years, the absence of a previous history of COVID-19, a negative RT-PCR result in SARS-CoV-2 testing, negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG results prior to vaccination, and the absence of severe somatic diseases. The patients were examined twice: immediately before vaccination and 90 days after the first dose was injected. We evaluated spermogram parameters, determined the levels of FSH, LH, TSH and total testosterone, and analyzed blood for IgM and IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) to cardiolipin (aCL), 2-glycoprotein-1 (a?2-GP1), annexin V (aAnV), phosphatidylserine (aPS), as well as IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using enzyme immunoassay. Results. There were no significant changes in the parameters of spermogram and hormone levels before and after vaccination;men with moderate impairment of spermatogenesis (oligoasteno-and/or teratozoospermia) did not show considerable changes either. The level of aPL after vaccination did not increase compared to the baseline level. Besides, there was no correlation between the dynamics of the level of antisperm antibodies, aPL and spermogram parameters. These findings indirectly indicate that there are no changes in the reproductive function associated with this autoimmune factor after vaccination in men. Conclusion.

Several recently published studies emphasize the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes, thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually solved in the recent years.This review will summarize the most recent technological developments and application of mRNA vaccines in clinical trials and discusses the results, challenges and future directions with a special focus on the induced innate and adaptive immune responses.","output":"Clinical and immunological effects of mRNA vaccines in malignant diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With nearly three-fourths of the U S population isolated in their homes between early March and the end of May, almost all of whom regularly watch television (TV), it was no surprise that companies began to purchase airtime on major television networks to advertise (ad) their brands and showcase their empathy with the populace But how would the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic curve have changed had these same dollars been allocated to proven preventive interventions?

Rhinolophu s bats are presumed to be natural progenitors of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses. Initially pangolin was thought to be the source of spillover to human, but they might get infected from human or other animal species. So, the virus spillover pathways to humans remain unknown. Human-to-animal transmission has been testified in pet, farmed, zoo and free-ranging wild animals. Infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings like, mink-to-mink, and mink-to-cat transmission. Animal-to-human transmission is not a persistent pathway, while mink-to-human transmission continues to be illuminated. Multiple companion and captive wild animals were infected by emerging alpha variant of concern (B.1.1.7 lineage) whereas Asiatic lions were infected by delta variant, (B.1.617.2). To date, multiple animal species- cat, ferrets, non-human primates, hamsters, and bats, showed high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in experimental condition, while swine, poultry, cattle showed no susceptibility. The founding of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animal reservoirs can confronts the control of the virus in humans and might carry a risk to the welfare and conservation of wildlife as well.

The preclass preparation resources and the active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to solely online teaching. Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform. Instead of small group discussions in the classroom, teams interacted in Zoom Breakout Rooms. Rather than taking exams in-person during scheduled class time, students submitted exams online. Additionally, students prerecorded their project presentations instead of presenting them live during the last week of classes.

Objective: To determine whether symptoms and laboratory results on the first day of COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with development of a case cluster in a congregant setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of trainees with COVID-19 from May 11 through August 24, 2020, was conducted at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, the primary site of entry for enlistment in the US Air Force. Symptoms and duration, known contacts, and cycle threshold for trainees diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were collected. A cycle threshold value represents the number of nucleic acid amplification cycles that occur before a specimen containing the target material generates a signal greater than the predetermined threshold that defines positivity. Cohorts with 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection were defined as clusters. Participants included 10a?613 trainees divided into 263 parallel cohorts of 30 to 50 people arriving weekly for 7 weeks of training. Exposures: All trainees were quarantined for 14 days on arrival. Testing was performed on arrival, on day 14, and anytime during training when indicated. Protective measures included universal masking, physical distancing, and rapid isolation of trainees with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between days of symptoms, specific symptoms, number of symptoms, or cycle threshold values of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent transmission within cohorts. Results: In this cohort study of 10a?613 US Air Force basic trainees in 263 cohorts, 403 trainees (3%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 in 129 cohorts (49%). Among trainees with COVID-19 infection, 318 (79%) were men, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 20 (19-23) years; 204 (51%) were symptomatic, and 199 (49%) were asymptomatic. Median (IQR) cycle threshold values were lower in symptomatic trainees compared with asymptomatic trainees (21.2 [18.4-27.60] vs 34.8 [29.3-37.4]; P < .001). Cohorts with clusters of individuals with COVID-19 infection were predominantly men (204 cohorts [89%] vs 114 cohorts [64%]; P < .001), had more symptomatic trainees (146 cohorts [64%] vs 53 cohorts [30%]; P < .001), and had more median (IQR) symptoms per patient (3 [2-5] vs 1 [1-2]; P < .001) compared with cohorts without clusters. Within cohorts, subsequent development of clusters of 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection compared with those that did not develop clusters was associated with cohorts that had more symptomatic trainees (31 of 58 trainees [53%] vs 43 of 151 trainees [28%]; P = .001) and lower median (IQR) cycle threshold values (22.3 [18.4-27.3] vs 35.3 [26.5-37.8]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US Air Force trainees living in a congregant setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, higher numbers of symptoms and lower cycle threshold values were associated with subsequent development of clusters of individuals with COVID-19 infection. These values may be useful if validated in future studies.","output":"Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Transmission Among US Air Force Trainees in a Congregant Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible mice is an animal model for human demyelinating diseases. Previously we described an altered and diminished pattern of central nervous system disease in immunocompetent SJL/J mice infected with a variant virus.

Here we characterize the variant virus by ELISA and neutralization assays and by sequencing selected regions of the viral RNA genome and relate the alteration to disease. The variant virus contains one single point mutation within a neutralizing epitope of VP- 1. This nucleotide change lead to an amino acid replacement at amino acid 101 of VP-1, a threonine (wild type) to an isoleucine (variant). Model building based on sequence alignments and the known structure of the related Mengo virus indicates that the altered amino acid is located in an exposed loop on the surface of the virus at the periphery of a site that has been proposed to be the receptor binding site. The results of ELISA, neutralization assay, and direct RNA sequencing provide for the first time an opportunity to precisely map an important structural determinant of neurovirulence.","output":"Alteration of amino acid 101 within capsid protein VP-1 changes the pathogenicity of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Having been confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kingdom of Eswatini has had to adopt both soft and hard response measures The constitutional emergency response framework had not envisaged the type of emergency brought about by COVID-19, forcing the state to enact extraordinary regulatory measures Unprecedented emergency powers have been conferred on state functionaries Questions have arisen as to the nature of these emergency powers, the manner in which these powers have been exercised and the absence of special oversight mechanisms The response measures and regulations have had an unparalleled impact on lives and livelihoods of Emaswati This article explores the nature of emergency powers in the laws of Eswatini, and the particular effects of the COVID-19 regulations on human rights This article commences with an analysis of constitutional emergency powers in Eswatini and the limitations thereof, and considers the question of why the state did not invoke a constitutional state of emergency The article proceeds to examine the nature of statutory emergency powers under the Disaster Management Act, and considers whether there are effective legal limitations on the exercise of executive authority and effective safeguards against the abuse of power The article then deals with the particular impact of the COVID-19 response legal framework on human rights protection In this regard, the article advances examples of situations where rights have been infringed Finally, the article proposes that the states response measures should continuously endeavour to mitigate the long-term impact on human rights ? 2020, Pretoria University Law Press All rights reserved","output":"Eswatinis legislative response to COVID-19: Whither human rights?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Involvement of macrophages in the SARS-CoV-2-associated cytokine storm, the excessive secretion of inflammatory/anti-viral factors leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, is unclear.

Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, and vaccination is a middle-term solution.This perspective covers the chemistry and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and potential pharmacological interventions of the coronavirus pandemic, including discussion of the different drug modalities such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The most likely scenario for a short-term solution of the COVID-19 crisis is the multiple drug repurposing approaches currently being pursued.","output":"Chemistry and Biology of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State-of-The-Art nanopore sequencing enables rapid and real-Time identification of novel pathogens, which has wide application in various research areas and is an emerging diagnostic tool for infectious diseases including COVID-19 Nanopore translocation enables de novo sequencing with long reads (&gt; 10 kb) of novel genomes, which has advantages over existing short-read sequencing technologies Biological nanopore sequencing has already achieved success as a technology platform but it is sensitive to empirical factors such as pH and temperature Alternatively, ?ngstr?m-and nano-scale solid-state nanopores, especially those based on two-dimensional (2D) membranes, are promising next-generation technologies as they can surpass biological nanopores in the variety of membrane materials, ease of defining pore morphology, higher nucleotide detection sensitivity, and facilitation of novel and hybrid sequencing modalities Since the discovery of graphene, atomically-Thin 2D materials have shown immense potential for the fabrication of nanopores with well-defined geometry, rendering them viable candidates for nanopore sequencing membranes Here, we review recent progress and future development trends of 2D materials and their ?ngstr?m-and nano-scale pore-based nucleic acid (NA) sequencing including fabrication techniques and current and emerging sequencing modalities In addition, we discuss the current challenges of translocation-based nanopore sequencing and provide an outlook on promising future research directions Copyright ?

Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01).

Two extensive forest vegetation survey datasets are explored, using ordination and classification, for evidence of in situ regeneration by Pinus strobus (Eastern white pine) and P. resinosa (Red pine). Ordination of tree species contributions to total basal area in 320 upland northern hardwood\\\\ conifer stands produced distinct stand groups for P.banksiana, P. resinosa, P. strobus and mesic hardwoods in an ascending sequence along the first axis. Quercus rubra (red oak), Q. alba (white oak) and tolerant conifer groups formed segregates from the hardwood complex along the second axis. P. strobus mixes with all other forest types, but P. resinosa is restricted to its own group. Seedlings and trees of P. strobus are more abundant than saplings, which are restricted to the pine and oak forests. Therefore, seed production, dispersal and seedling establishment seem to be less of a barrier to in situ regeneration by P. strobus than subsequent survival and growth. Canonical correspondence analysis of 170 pine\\\\dominated stands from the Canadian Shield of Ontario, in which tree species variables are segmented into height\\\\class pseudo\\\\ species, yielded no linear relationship between environmental features or stand structure and seedling densities of P. strobus. However, total tree basal area appears to impose an upper limit to seedling density on the forest floor. Strong correlations emerged between pine seedling density and understorey vegetation. Stand classification of the understorey vegetation, using constrained indicator species analysis, yielded distinct high and low seedling groups. Low pine seedling density was associated with abundant broadleaved shrubs, herbs and seedlings as well as feathermosses and tolerant conifers. High seedling density could not be ascribed to the presence of seedbed taxa, such as Polytrichum, but is ascribed to the absence of competition and other forms of inhibition in the understorey vegetation and down through the canopy profile. In situ regeneration of P. strobus does, therefore, occur but conditions over the forest landscape are largely restrictive.","output":"In situ regeneration of Pinus strobus and P. resinosa in the Great Lakes forest communities of Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The literature agrees on the impact of post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents of seriously ill children but there is less clarity about the real extent and gender differences of this psychopathological risk.

OBJECTIVE: In this review, we present a synthesis of the updated evidence on PTSD rates in parents of children with severe diseases. We also aim to try to understand if research in this field has been refined over time with the long-term intent to better face the new challenges of Covid-19 in the paediatric field.

The studies show that carriers with mild or no symptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on the disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the time-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably different in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the effect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the meta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties, and symptom development duration are investigated to establish a centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A convex traffic volume optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak. The control process is done by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality and then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume (motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case scenarios in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.","output":"Centrality-Based Traffic Restriction in Delayed Epidemic Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing homes (NH) for the elderly have been particularly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic mainly due to their hosted vulnerable populations and poor outbreak preparedness. In Belgium, the medical humanitarian organization Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) implemented a support project for NH including training on infection prevention and control (IPC), (re)-organization of care, and psychosocial support for NH staff. As psychosocial and mental health needs of NH residents in times of Covid-19 are poorly understood and addressed, this study aimed to better understand these needs and how staff could respond accordingly. METHODS: A qualitative study adopting thematic content analysis. Eight focus group discussions with direct caring staff and 56 in-depth interviews with residents were conducted in eight purposively and conveniently selected NHs in Brussels, Belgium, June 2020. RESULTS: NH residents experienced losses of freedom, social life, autonomy, and recreational activities that deprived them of their basic psychological needs. This had a massive impact on their mental well-being expressed in feeling depressed, anxious, and frustrated as well as decreased meaning and quality of life. Staff felt unprepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic; lacking guidelines, personal protective equipment and clarity around organization of care. They were confronted with professional and ethical dilemmas, feeling 'trapped' between IPC and the residents' wellbeing. They witnessed the detrimental effects of the measures imposed on their residents. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the insights of residents' and NH staff at the height of the early Covid-19 pandemic. Clearer outbreak plans, including psychosocial support, could have prevented the aggravated mental health conditions of both residents and staff. A holistic approach is needed in NHs in which tailor-made essential restrictive IPC measures are combined with psychosocial support measures to reduce the impact on residents' mental health impact and to enhance their quality of life.","output":"How to bring residents' psychosocial well-being to the heart of the fight against Covid-19 in Belgian nursing homes-A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors present the case of a young man victim of a traffic accident during the SARS-CoV-2 confinement, having presented a fracture of the femoral shaft that was soon complicated by respiratory failure with oxygen desaturation.

Thus, by this current study, we investigated the HCV NS3/4A inhibitory and host immune-modulatory activity of phytocompounds from T. chebula through in silico strategies involving network pharmacology and structural bioinformatics techniques. To start with, the phytochemical dataset of T. chebula was curated from biological databases and the published literature. Further, the target ability of the phytocompounds was predicted using BindingDB for both HCV NS3/4A and other probable host targets involved in the immune system. Further, the identified targets were docked to the phytochemical dataset using AutoDock Vina executed through the POAP pipeline. The resultant docked complexes with significant binding energy were subjected to 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in order to infer the stability of complex formation. During network pharmacology analysis, the gene set pathway enrichment of host targets was performed using the STRING and Reactome pathway databases. Further, the biological network among compounds, proteins, and pathways was constructed using Cytoscape 3.6.1. Furthermore, the druglikeness, side effects, and toxicity of the phytocompounds were also predicted using the MolSoft, ADVERpred, and PreADMET methods, respectively. Out of 41 selected compounds, 10 were predicted to target HCV NS3/4A and also to possess druglike and nontoxic properties. Among these 10 molecules, Chebulagic acid and 1,2,3,4,6-Pentagalloyl glucose exhibited potent HCV NS3/4A inhibitory activity, as these scored a lowest binding energy (BE) of ?8.6 kcal/mol and ?7.7 kcal/mol with 11 and 20 intermolecular interactions with active site residues, respectively.

This molecule antagonizes the function of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to promote proMMP-2 maturation. Here, we attempt to clarify the mechanism underlying RECK functions. First, we found that RECK forms a complex with MT1-MMP and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Notably, RECK increases the amount of MT1-MMP that associates with detergent-resistant membranes during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, perturbation of membrane cholesterol significantly affected the function of RECK in suppressing MT1-MMP function. These findings indicate that RECK possibly regulates MT1-MMP function by modulating its behavior on the cell surface as well as by enzymatic action; this prompted us to find another molecule whose behavior in detergent-resistant membranes is influenced by RECK. Subsequently, we found that RECK interacts with CD13/aminopeptidase N. Further, we found that RECK inhibits the proteolytic activity of CD13 in a cholesterol perturbation-sensitive manner. Finally, we examined whether RECK influences the behavior of MT1-MMP and CD13 during their internalization from the cell surface. In the absence of RECK, MT1-MMP and CD13 were internalized along with the markers of clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis. However, interestingly, in the presence of RECK these molecules were internalized preferentially with an endocytic marker that is neither clathrinnor caveolae-dependent, indicating that RECK modulates endocytic pathways of MT1-MMP and CD13. This modulation was correlated with the accelerated internalization and decay of MT1-MMP and CD13.

METHODS: We performed a literature review using PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane and a manual search of national and international societies for management recommendations for urogynaecological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Nine guidance documents and 17 articles, including 10 reviews, were included. Virtual clinics are recommended for new and follow-up patients, to assess and initiate treatment, as well as triage patients who require face-to-face appointments. Outpatient investigations such as urodynamics and cystoscopy for benign indications can be deferred. Prolapse and continence surgery should be suspended, except in specific circumstances such as procidentia with upper tract complications and failed pessaries. There is no evidence to support a particular route of surgery, but recommendations are made to minimise COVID-19 transmission.

We designed a descriptive cohort study including 90 successive ICU COVID-19 patients admitted between March and May 2020 and 90 successive non-COVID-19 patients admitted between March and May 2019. In this study, the CED resulting from all radiological examinations was calculated and clinical characteristics predictive of higher exposure risk identified. The number of radiological examinations was 12.0 (5.0-26.0) [median (interquartile range) in COVID-19 vs.4.0 (2.0-8.0) in non-COVID-19 patient (P < 0.001)]. The CED during a four-month period was 4.2 mSv (1.9-11.2) in the COVID-19 vs. 1.2 mSv (0.13-6.19) in the non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In the survivors, the CED in COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19 patients was 100 mSv in 3% vs. 0%, 10-100 mSv in 23% vs. 15%, 1-10 mSv in 56% vs. 30% and <1 mSv in 18% vs. 55%. The CED (P < 0.001) and CED per ICU hospitalization day (P = 0.004) were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients.

In the present work, a novel thermophilic extradiol dioxygenase from Thermomonospora curvata DSM43183 was cloned, expressed, and characterized by phylogenetic and biochemical analyses. This enzyme exhibited excellent thermo-tolerance, displaying optimal activity at 50 C, remaining >40% activity at 70 C. Structural modeling and molecular docking demonstrated that both active center and pocket-construction loops locate at the C-terminal domain. Site-specific mutants D285A, H205V, F301V based on a rational design were obtained to widen the entrance of substrates; resulting in significantly improved catalytic performance for all the 3 mutants. Compared to the wild-type, the mutant D285A showed remarkably improved activities with respect to the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, catechol, and 3-chlorocatechol, by 17.7, 6.9, and 3.7-fold, respectively. The results thus verified the effectiveness of modeling guided design; and confirmed that the C-terminal loop structure indeed plays a decisive role in determining catalytic ring-opening efficiency and substrate specificity of the enzyme.

Telehealth visits allowed the continued care for outpatients and thus the preoperative screening for bariatric candidates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tele-screening on the multidisciplinary obesity teams decision (MDD) for bariatric surgery: disapproval, direct approval, or a recommendation for a prehabilitation program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital data were collected from patients who underwent face-to-face or tele-screening for bariatric surgery between April and December 2020. The tele-screening cohort was then compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients with face-to-face consultations. A chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: After propensity matching, 396 patients remained for analysis. The majority received preoperative prehabilitation advice in both the tele-screening and face-to-face group (51% versus 50%). Although not significant, there were more direct approvals and fewer denials in the face-to-face group (p = 0.691). The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed no significant impact of tele-screening on the MDD result. CONCLUSION: Tele-screening in bariatric centers is feasible; the multidisciplinary teams decision was not significantly different between tele-screening and face-to-face screening which encourages the use of tele-screening in the future. An insignificant amount of fewer direct approvals and more denials were observed in the tele-screening group, which should be taken into account in future and larger case studies.

The subsequent increase in referrals for pectus excavatum repair provided large patient series for clinical analyses to better define underlying physiologic impairments and stimulated surgeons to develop technical improvements to enhance the safety and effectiveness of pectus excavatum repair. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical assessment, diagnostic imaging, and cardiorespiratory testing of patients with pectus excavatum have helped to characterize physiologic impairments associated with severe pectus excavatum and to define inclusion criteria for surgical repair. Appropriate timing of repair is important to minimize complications, especially recurrence. Evidence of improved cardiorespiratory function after pectus excavatum repair has been presented. As a result of numerous technical improvements, safe and effective operative correction of pectus excavatum has been reported for both the Nuss procedure and open repair. SUMMARY The findings presented in this review provide objective evidence of the cardiorespiratory impairment associated with severe pectus excavatum.

We sought to identify factors affecting initial humoral immune response to SARS-Cov-2 vaccines among patients with IBD. DESIGN: In this prospective cohort of SARS-CoV-2 immunized patients with IBD, we evaluated associations between participant age, sex, vaccine type, and medication use and the presence of detectable anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody and quantitative antibody level. RESULTS: 1909 participants were included (1123, 692, and 94 received BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S respectively) of whom 96% achieved a positive antibody response. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with lack of antibody response were older age (p=0.043), BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273 (OR 2.1, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.0-3.9), and combination therapy with anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and 6MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.4-7.3).

METHODS Multiple regression analysis estimated the influence of extra-cerebral oxygenation as exemplified by skin oxygenation (Sskin O2 ) on Sc O2 in 21 healthy subjects exposed to whole-body exercise in hypoxia (Fi O2 = 12%; n = 10) and normoxia (n = 12), whole-body heating, hyperventilation (n = 21), administration of norepinephrine with and without petCO2 -correction (n = 15), phenylephrine and head-up tilt (n = 7). Sc O2 was assessed simultaneously by NIRO-200NX (Sniro O2 ) and INVOS-4100 (Sinvos O2 ). Arterial (Sa O2 ) and jugular bulb oxygen saturations (Sj O2 ) were obtained.

Clinical data on patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study evaluated risk factors for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH), infected with SARS-CoV-2 in three countries in different clinical settings. COVID-19 was clinically classified as to be mild-to-moderate or severe. RESULTS: Of 175 patients, 49 (28%) had severe COVID-19 and 7 (4%) patients died. Almost all patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in 94%, HIV RNA was below 50 copies/mL prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In the univariate analysis, an age 50 years or older, a CD4+ T cell nadir of < 200/l, current CD4+ T cells < 350/l and the presence of at least one comorbidity were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19. No significant association was found for gender, ethnicity, obesity, a detectable HIV RNA, a prior AIDS-defining illness, or tenofovir (which was mainly given as alafenamide) or protease inhibitor use in the current ART. In a multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with risk for severe COVID-19 was a current CD4+ T cell count of < 350/l (adjusted odds ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.44, p=0.01). The only factor associated with mortality was a low CD4 T cell nadir.

Participants included older adults older than 70 years (N = 6). PROCEDURE Focus group questions pertained to (1) the SP experience, (2) thoughts and emotions throughout the SP experience, and (3) applicability of workshop content and SP experience to personal life. The focus group lasted 90 min, was digitally recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Authors independently coded transcripts to identify categories and supporting quotations. Categories and subcategories were condensed and modified through iterative discussions. Descriptive content analysis was utilized for data analysis.

Abnormal activation of RAS upregulates angiotensin II (Ang-II) and contributes to severe manifestations of COVID-19. Although RAS inhibitors (RASi) are a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, they have been associated (in some animal studies) with an increase in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, current medical practice does not recommend curtailing RASi to protect hypertensive patients from COVID. On the contrary, there is clinical evidence to support a beneficial effect of RASi for hypertensive patients in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise mechanism for this is unclear. In this paper, we hypothesize that RASi reduces the severity of COVID-19 by promoting ACE2-AT1R complex formation at the cell surface, where AT1R mediates the major vasopressor effects of Ang-II. Furthermore, we propose that the interaction between ACE2 and AT1R impedes binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, thereby allowing ACE2 to convert Ang-II to the more beneficial Ang(1-7), that has vasodilator and anti-inflammatory activity. Evidence for ACE2-AT1R complex formation during reduced Ang-II comes from receptor colocalization studies in isolated HEK293 cells, but this has not been confirmed in cells having endogenous expression of ACE2 and AT1R. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks the kidney, as well as the heart and lung, our hypothesis for the effect of RASi on COVID-19 could be tested in vitro using human proximal tubule cells (HK-2), having ACE2 and AT1 receptors. Specifically, colocalization of fluorescent labelled: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ACE2, and AT1R in HK-2 cells can be used to clarify the mechanism of RASi action in renal and lung epithelia, which could lead to protocols for reducing the severity of COVID-19 in both hypertensive and normotensive patients.","output":"Hypothesis for renin-angiotensin inhibitor mitigation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are the safest and most effective gene delivery vehicles to drive long-term transgene expression in gene therapy.

These patients developed pneumomediastinum before or during orotracheal intubation (OTI) or without OTI. The four patients were three men and one woman with a mean age of 60.5 years (48C74 years). No patients had a known history of lung disease or traumatic events, except for one patient who had a history of smoking, but who was without parenchymal disease. All intubations were performed without complications. No cases of pneumomediastinum occurred after tracheostomy, and none of the patients had tomographic or bronchoscopic evidence of tracheal injury. Although the pneumomediastinum observed in our cases was apparently not related to a violation of the aerodigestive track, this complication was associated with a worse prognosis.

This includes current and evolving research exploring migration and Covid-19, initiated in March 2020 when the first cases of Covid-19 were identified in Southern Africa. The aim is for these findings to catalyse a new and evolving researh agenda to inform the development and implementation of appropriate pandemic responses in a region associated with some of the highest levels of inequality globally. To this end, an evolving research agenda should be responsive to current needs. We suggest that, in SADC, priority research should focus on improving our understanding of (1) the political factors influencing the (dis)connections between migration and health governance structures in the context of Covid-19, and how to overcome these in the context of a pandemic; and (2) the motivations for and implications of a vaccine passport system on movement within and beyond the SADC region. This requires a reactive, cross-disciplinary, regional research network. In a context where funding for research is increasingly inaccessible, this requires innovative, informal, collaborative engagement.","output":"Global health (security), immigration governance and Covid-19 in South(ern) Africa: An evolving research agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cell immunity, such as CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses, plays a vital role in controlling the virus infection and pathological damage. Several studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins could serve as ideal vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating the T cell responses. In the current study, based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and distribution of host human leukocyte antigen (HLA), we predicted the possible epitopes for the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Firstly, the current study retrieved the SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein sequences from the NCBI Database. Then, using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource, we predicted the CTL epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins according to worldwide frequency distributions of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles (>1%). Our results predicted 90 and 106 epitopes of N and S proteins, respectively. Epitope cluster analysis showed 16 and 34 respective clusters of SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, which covered 95.91% and 96.14% of the global population, respectively. After epitope conservancy analysis, 8 N protein epitopes and 6 S protein epitopes showed conservancy within two SARS-CoV-2 types. Of these 14 epitopes, 13 could cover SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS-like coronavirus. The remaining epitope (KWPWYIWLGF(1211-1220)) could cover MERS coronavirus. Finally, the 14-epitope combination could vaccinate 89.60% of all individuals worldwide. Our results propose single or combined CTL epitopes predicted in the current study as candidates for vaccines to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection and development.","output":"COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine T cell epitope prediction analysis based on distributions of HLA class I loci (HLA-A, -B, -C) across global populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The fast spread of the virus has led to a significant reduction in the numbers of elective procedures especially cosmetic interventions. Although many measures have been carried out to offload the health care system, it is unclear whether these changes had an effect on general population perception toward undergoing cosmetic procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the perception of Saudis toward undergoing a cosmetic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online survey consisting of two parts was used, with a series of questions about cosmetic procedures, in general, and cosmetic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular. The survey included Saudis (age 18 to 60 years) with access to social media. RESULTS: A total of 563 respondents participated in this survey. The vast majority were women (86.9%) and were between 18 and 24 years old (38.7%). Some 27.4% considered a cosmetic procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, only 11.9% underwent any. In the majority of the participants (86%), the pandemic did not change their minds about having a cosmetic procedure. About 49.7% agreed that fear of contracting the virus would be a factor for not undergoing a cosmetic procedure during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Clear differences in the engagement and perception of cosmetic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic exist among Saudis. More studies are needed to explore the effects of pandemics on aesthetic practice and to find ways to perform elective procedures in a safe way.","output":"Perception of Cosmetic Procedures among Saudis during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is necessary to make informed public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. PCR assays have received global attention, facilitating a rapid understanding of variant dynamics because they are more accessible and scalable than genome sequencing. However, as PCR assays target only a few mutations, their accuracy could be reduced when these mutations are not exclusive to the target variants. Here we introduce PRIMES, an algorithm that evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific PCR assays across different geographical regions by incorporating sequences deposited in the GISAID database. Using PRIMES, we determined that the accuracy of several PCR assays decreased when applied beyond the geographic scope of the study in which the assays were developed. Subsequently, we used this tool to design Alpha and Delta variant-specific PCR assays for samples from Illinois, USA. In silico analysis using PRIMES determined the sensitivity/specificity to be 0.99/0.99 for the Alpha variant-specific PCR assay and 0.98/1.00 for the Delta variant-specific PCR assay in Illinois, respectively. We applied these two variant-specific PCR assays to six local sewage samples and determined the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant of either the wild type, the Alpha variant, or the Delta variant. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the spike (S) gene amplicons of the Delta variant-dominant samples, we found six mutations exclusive to the Delta variant (S:T19R, S:156/157, S:L452R, S:T478K, S:P681R, and S:D950N). The consistency between the variant-specific PCR assays and the NGS results supports the applicability of PRIMES. IMPORTANCE Monitoring the introduction and prevalence of variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) in a community can help the local authorities make informed public health decisions. PCR assays can be designed to keep track of SARS-CoV-2 variants by measuring unique mutation markers that are exclusive to the target variants. However, the mutation markers may not be exclusive to the target variants because of regional and temporal differences in variant dynamics. We introduce PRIMES, an algorithm that enables the design of reliable PCR assays for variant detection. Because PCR is more accessible, scalable, and robust for sewage samples than sequencing technology, our findings will contribute to improving global SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance.","output":"Design of SARS-CoV-2 Variant-Specific PCR Assays Considering Regional and Temporal Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coagulopathies are one of the obstetric complications affecting the period of pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does exercise at various intensities produce aerosols in significant quantities? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this experimental study, subjects were eight healthy volunteers (six men, two women) who were 20 to 63 years old. The 20-minute test protocol of 5 minutes rest, four 3-minute stages of exercise at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of age-predicted heart rate reserve, and 3 minutes active recovery was performed in a clean, controlled environment. Aerosols were measured by four particle counters that were place to surround the subject. RESULTS: Age averaged 41  14 years. Peak heart rate was 173  17 beat/min (97% predicted); peak maximal oxygen uptake was 33.9  7.5 mL/kg/min; and peak respiratory exchange ratio was 1.22  0.10.

Methods: From February 5 to March 8, 2020, 73 patients (male to female, ratio of 43:30; mean age, 51 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and followed up until discharge from three institutions in China. The patients were divided into the severe and non-severe groups according to treatment option. The patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, single ground-glass opacity (GGO) CT scores, single consolidation CT scores, single reticular CT scores and the amounts of zones involved were reviewed by 2 radiologists. These features were analyzed for temporal changes. Results: In non-severe group, total CT scores (median, 9.5) and the amounts of zones involved were slowly increased and peaked in disease week 2. In the severe group, the increase was faster, with scores also peaking at 2 weeks (median, 20). In both groups, the later parameters began to decrease in week 4 (median values of 9 and 19 in the non-severe and severe groups, respectively). In the severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were reticular (median single reticular CT score, 10) and consolidation (median single consolidation CT score, 7). In the non-severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were GGO (median single GGO CT score, 7) and reticular (median single reticular CT score, 4).

DESIGN: The study was planned prospectively and observationally. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients older than 18 years old, polymerase chain reaction test positive, with signs of pneumonia on tomography, and hospitalized were included in the study. ICU need, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in-hospital mortality were considered as primary endpoints. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were taken from patients three times for angiotensin II levels. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Angiotensin II levels were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The SPSS 24.0 program (Statistics Program for Social Scientists, SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data. A total of 112 patients were included in the study, of which 63.4% of the patients were men. The serum angiotensin II levels were statistically significantly lower in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with the healthy control group (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance between the serum angiotensin II levels measured at three different times (p > 0.05). The serum angiotensin II levels of the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were found to be statistically significantly lower than those without acute respiratory distress syndrome in three samples collected at different clinical periods (p < 0.05).

In a time of crisis, continued access to and delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (M-OUD) is essential to save lives. However, prior to COVID-19, large variability in M-OUD adoption existed across the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) and it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this divide. For the past two years, our team worked with eight VHA facilities to enhance adoption of M-OUD through a multi-component implementation intervention. This commentary explores these providers' responses to COVID-19 and the subsequent impact on their progress toward increasing adoption of M-OUD. Briefly, the loosening of regulatory restrictions fostered accelerated adoption of M-OUD, rapid support for telehealth offered a mechanism to increase M-OUD access, and reevaluation of current practices surrounding M-OUD strengthened adoption. Overall, during the COVID-19 crisis, facilities and providers responded positively to the call for increased access to M-OUD and appropriate care of patients with OUD. The VHA providers' responses and continued progress in enhancing M-OUD amidst a crisis may, in part, be attributable to their participation in an implementation effort prior to COVID-19 that established resources, expert support, and a community of practice. We anticipate the themes presented are generalizable to other healthcare systems grappling to deliver care to patients with OUD during a crisis.

Whether PCT can detect secondary bacterial infections or reflect target tissue injury in this setting is still unclear. Here we performed a meta-analysis to review the prognostic value of PCT for severe disease and adverse outcome events in COVID-19.Methods: We searched relevant publications in online databases. Studies were included if they reported categorical data according to disease severity and/or outcomes. We analysed extracted data using fixed or random-effects meta-analysis models, as appropriate, depending on the presence of significant heterogeneity. Results: Data from 14 studies (3492 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, 163 of 256 patients with elevated PCT had severe disease (63.7%) compared with 553 of 2047 with negative PCT (27.0%) (OR: 5.92; 95% CI: 3.20 to 10.94). Elevated PCT was also associated with adverse outcomes (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 7.37 to 23.1). PCT was increased in 22.8% and 30.6% of patients with the severe course and adverse outcome, respectively. Rates of secondary bacterial infections ranged from 4.7% to 19.5% and were associated with increased risk of severe course or fatal outcomes (OR: 20.8; 95% CI: 11.6 to 37.4). Conclusions: Elevated PCT levels could identify a subset of COVID-19 patients at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcome.

The adverse interactions between HPT, obesity and COVID-19 are currently being witnessed globally and represent a collision of pandemics. Understanding the burden that this non-communicable disease (NCD) poses in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa (SA), would help in developing improved public healthcare strategies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden of HPT in all the districts of KZN over a 6-year period. METHODS: HPT data are routinely collected from all KZN public health facilities (both clinics and hospitals) as part of the District Health Information System (DHIS). In this retrospective study, we accessed HPT records from the DHIS over a period of 6 years (2014 - 2019, inclusive). Data collected included the number of patients screened, diagnosed and initiated on therapy for HPT, together with the number of obese patients. RESULTS: The slopes for HPT screening were positive at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (considerably more at clinics than hospitals, with a difference in elevations of slopes of p&lt;0.001), with a significantly greater percentage of the population having been screened at rural clinics than at hospitals (difference in elevation of slopes p&lt;0.001). A significantly greater number of patients aged &lt;40 years (p&lt;0.001) were being screened for HPT at clinics than at hospitals (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20), while hospitals screened considerably more patients aged &#8805;40 years in 2017 - 2018 (p&lt;0.001). The numbers of new hypertensives diagnosed and having treatment initiated were on an upward slope at both clinics and hospitals, with clinics having a greater elevation of slope than hospitals (p&lt;0.001), irrespective of patient age. A significantly greater number of patients aged &#8805;40 years (p&lt;0.05) were diagnosed with HPT at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20). KZN clinics remained the first port of call for known hypertensives throughout the study period. Obesity was prevalent at both clinic and hospital level, although figures were significantly higher at clinics. Over 80% of the obesity burden was carried by the rural clinics and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and chronic management of HPT occur mainly at rural clinic level. The SA government needs to heed these findings and redirect resources (staffing and equipment) to this level.

Influenza is a virus with respiratory symptoms, fever, and systemic symptoms very similar to COVID 19. Various public health measures have been taken by governments and health authorities to prevent and control the pandemics. This study aimed to review the economic evaluation of public health measures against COVID-19 and influenza pandemics. Methods: : We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify full economic evaluation studies on Influenza and COVID-19 pandemic published from 1998-2020. We built an exhaustive database search strategy. The search was done in Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE databases, and grey literature. We extracted data from selected studies using a structured data collection form after conducting a risk of bias assessment. Narrative summary tables were used to present the result and characteristics of eligible studies. Furthermore, we converted findings of studies that reported their outcome in costs per case averted and death averted into costs per life-year gained. All cost and Cost-effectiveness ratios were converted to 2019 US dollars using the exchange rate and GDP deflator. The study was registered in PROSPERO with registration No. CRD42020192384. Results: : The review revealed that most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries, and only few of the studies were on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Stockpiling drugs for the treatment of sick patients was found cost-effective in most of the studies. Treatment with antiviral drugs and vaccination were found very cost-effective. The addition of school closure to other interventions was considered cost-effective only for a pandemic with a high case fatality ratio. Almost all interventions were sensitive to the infectivity and severity of the pandemic. Most of the studies were also cost-effective from the societal perspective indicating a higher net societal benefit from the pandemic prevention and control strategies. Conclusion: In conclusion, most of the interventions were cost-effective under various scenarios while school closure was cost-effective under a 'high case-fatality 'ratio' scenario only. Furthermore, the level of the pandemic's infectivity and severity were the key drivers of the cost-effectiveness of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"An economic evaluation of Influenza and COVID -19 pandemic prevention and control interventions: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assess the role of banks in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a large and unprecedented small business support program enacted as a response to the Covid-19 crisis in the US. The PPP administered over $525 billion in loans and grants to small businesses through the banking system. First, we provide empirical evidence of heterogeneity in the allocation of PPP funds. Firms that are larger and less affected by the Covid-19 crisis received loans earlier, even in a within-bank analysis. Second, we develop a model of PPP allocation through banks that is consistent with the data. We show that research designs based on bank or regional shocks in PPP disbursement, common in the empirical literature, cannot directly identify the overall effect of the program. Bank targeting implies that these designs can, at best, recover the effect of the PPP on a set of firms that is endogenous, changes over time, and is systematically different from the overall set of firms that receive PPP loans. We propose and implement a model--based estimation method of the overall effect of the program and find that the PPP saved 7.5 million jobs.","output":"Bank Incentives and the Impact of the Paycheck Protection Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many potential biomarkers in nephrology have been studied, but few are currently used in clinical practice.

Follow-up included 48 participants. Machine learning was used to correlate OPN with other factors to classify patients by GN type. The resulting algorithm had an accuracy of 87% in differentiating IgAN from other GNs using urinary OPN levels only. A lesser effect for discriminating MN and LN was observed. However, the lower number of patients and the phenotypic heterogeneity of MN and LN might have affected those results. OPN was significantly higher in IgAN at baseline than in other GNs and therefore might be useful for identifying patients with IgAN. That observation did not apply to either patients with IgAN at follow-up or to patients with other GNs. OPN seems to be a valuable biomarker and should be validated in future studies.

However, much of the existing literature emphasizes relationships and synergy rather than structural components of CBPR. This study introduces and tests new theoretical mechanisms of the CBPR Conceptual Model to address this limitation. METHODS Three-stage online cross-sectional survey administered from 2016 to 2018 with 165 community-engaged research projects identified through federal databases or training grants. Participants (N = 453) were principal investigators and project team members (both academic and community partners) who provided project-level details and perceived contexts, processes, and outcomes. Data were analyzed through structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparison analysis. RESULTS Commitment to Collective Empowerment was a key mediating variable between context and intervention activities. Synergy and Community Engagement in Research Actions were mediating variables between context/partnership process and outcomes. Collective Empowerment was most strongly aligned with Synergy, while higher levels of Structural Governance and lower levels of Relationships were most consistent with higher Community Engagement in Research Actions. CONCLUSIONS The CBPR Conceptual Model identifies key theoretical mechanisms for explaining health equity and health outcomes in community-academic partnerships. The scholarly literature's preoccupation with synergy and relationships overlooks two promising practices-Structural Governance and Collective Empowerment-that interact from contexts through mechanisms to influence outcomes.

However, the disruption of essential services due to the current Covid-19 pandemic can lead to a reversal of these gains in malaria control unless targeted, evidence-based interventions are implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The extent to which malaria services have been disrupted has not been fully characterized. This study was conducted to assess the impact of Covid-19 on malaria services in Rwanda. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted in three purposively selected districts in Rwanda. The quantitative data included malaria aggregated data reported at the health facility level and the community level. The data included the number of malaria tests, uncomplicated malaria cases, severe malaria cases, and malaria deaths. The qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions with community members and community health workers, as well as in-depth interviews with health care providers and staff working in the malaria programme. Interrupted time series analysis was conducted to compare changes in malaria presentations between the pre-Covid-19 period (January 2019 to February 2020) and Covid-19 period (from March 2020 to November 2020). The constant comparative method was used in qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-Covid-19 period, there was a monthly reduction in patients tested in health facilities of 4.32 per 1000 population and a monthly increase in patients tested in the community of 2.38 per 1000 population during the Covid-19 period. There was no change in the overall presentation rate for uncomplicated malaria. The was a monthly reduction in the proportion of severe malaria of 5.47 per 100,000 malaria cases. Additionally, although healthcare providers continued to provide malaria services, they were fearful that this would expose them and their families to Covid-19. Covid-19 mitigation measures limited the availability of transportation options for the community to seek care in health facilities and delayed the implementation of some key malaria interventions. The focus on Covid-19-related communication also reduced the amount of health information for other diseases provided to community members. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in patients increasingly seeking care in the community and poses challenges to maintaining delivery of malaria services in Rwanda. Interventions to mitigate these challenges should focus on strengthening programming for the community and home-based care models and integrating malaria messages into Covid-19-related communication. Additionally, implementation of the interrupted interventions should be timed and overlap with the malaria transmission season to mitigate Covid-19 consequences on malaria.","output":"The impact of Covid-19 on malaria services in three high endemic districts in Rwanda: a mixed-method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dalam tulisan kali ini peneliti akan membahas mengenai pemanfatan cabang keilmuan Kecerdasan Buatan (Artificial Intelegence) yakni pembelajaran dalam (Deep Learning) untuk mengidentifikasi obyek visual Lung CT Scan Images Dataset suspect COVID-19 dengan membandingkannya antara kondisi sehat dan kondisi kritis selama masa inkubasi virus ini.

However, there has been considerable evidence implicating the nervous system in COVID-19 infection. This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, WHO Coronavirus database, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and Web of Science databases was carried out in August 2020. Original studies involving patients who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 in their CSF were included. Key search terms encompassed all variations of COVID-19 AND Cerebrospinal Fluid. RESULTS: A total of 525 studies were identified. Fifty-six full-text articles were assessed, of which 14 were included. In total, 14 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their CSF. 21.4% (3/14) of patients had negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs despite a positive CSF sample. About 14.2% (2/14) of patients who initially had positive NP swabs developed neurological deterioration after a supposed recovery as indicated by their negative NP swabs, but their CSF still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Common symptoms were headache (42.8%; 6/14), fever (35.6%; 5/14), vomiting (28.6%; 4/14), cough (28.6; 4/14), visual disturbances (28.6%; 4/14), diarrhea (21.4%; 3/14), and seizures (21.4%; 3/14). Four patients (28.6%) were admitted to ICU, one (7.14%) was admitted to a rehabilitation facility, and two (14.3%) died.

We aimed to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and residents in LTCFs. METHODS: We did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF. Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with >20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked surveyCtest dataset. FINDINGS: 9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (564%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160 033 residents and 248 594 staff members. The weighted period prevalence of infection was 105% (95% CI 99C111) in residents and 38% (34C42) in staff members. 2724 (531%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (91%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks. The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 080 [95% CI 075C086], p<00001) and staff (070 [065C077], p<00001), and of large outbreaks (059 [038C093], p=0024) were significantly lower in LTCFs that paid staff statutory sick pay compared with those that did not. Each one unit increase in the staff-to-bed ratio was associated with a reduced odds of infection in residents (082 [078C087], p<00001) and staff (063 [059C068], p<00001. The odds of infection in residents (130 [123C137], p<00001) and staff (120 [113C129], p<00001), and of outbreaks (256 [194C349], p<00001) were significantly higher in LTCFs in which staff often or always cared for both infected or uninfected residents compared with those that cohorted staff with either infected or uninfected residents. Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (101 [101C101], p<00001) and staff (100 [100C101], p=00005), and of outbreaks (108 [105C110], p<00001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020). The odds of infection in residents (119 [112C126], p<00001) and staff (119 [110C129], p<00001), and of large outbreaks (165 [107C254], p=0024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit. Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 165 [156C174], p<00001) and staff (185 [172C198], p<00001), and of outbreaks (233 [172C316], p<00001) and large outbreaks (242 [167C351], p<00001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers. Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (133 [128C138], p<00001) and staff (148 [141C156], p<00001), and of outbreaks (184 [148C230], p<00001) and large outbreaks (162 [124C211], p=00004). INTERPRETATION: Half of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents. Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.

Current evidence suggests that infectious virus is not typically released from adults after 5 days of illness, however, little is known about the extent to which virus is deposited by infected individuals into the environment and whether deposited virus has the ability to infect new hosts. Further information about the deposition of viable influenza virus in the immediate vicinity of patients with pandemic influenza is fundamental to our understanding of the routes and mechanisms of transmission. OBJECTIVES To collect data on patients infected with pandemic H1N1 2009 (swine flu). Primary objectives were to correlate the amount of virus detected in a patient's nose with that recovered from his/her immediate environment, and with symptom duration and severity. Secondary objectives were to describe virus shedding and duration according to major patient characteristics: adults versus children, and those with mild illness (community patients) versus those with more severe disease (hospitalised patients). METHODS Adults and children, both in hospital and from the community, who had symptoms of pandemic H1N1 infection, were enrolled and visited every day during follow-up for a maximum of 12 days. Symptom data was collected and samples were taken, including nose swabs and swabs from surfaces and objects around patients. Samples of air were obtained using validated sampling equipment. The samples were tested for the presence of pandemic H1N1 virus, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect virus genome and an immunofluorescence technique to detect viable virus. RESULTS Forty-three subjects were followed up, and 19 of them were subsequently proven to be infected with pandemic H1N1 virus. The median duration of virus shedding from the 19 infected cases was 6 days when detection was performed by PCR, and 3 days when detection was performed by a culture technique. Over 30% of cases remained potentially infectious for at least 5 days. Only 0.5% of all community and none of the hospital swabs taken revealed virus on surfaces. Five subjects had samples of the air around them collected and virus was detected by PCR from four; some of the air particles in which virus was detected were small enough to be inhaled and deposited deep in the lungs. LIMITATION Small number of subjects recruited. CONCLUSIONS The finding that over 30% of infected individuals have infectious virus in their noses for 5 days or more has infection control implications. The data suggest that contact transmission of pandemic influenza via fomites may be less important than previously thought, but transmission via bioaerosols at short range may be possible, meaning that high-level personal protective equipment may be needed by health-care workers when attending patients with pandemic influenza. Further work is being undertaken to consolidate these findings, as they have important potential implications for the protection of health-care workers and the formulation of advice to households, nationally and internationally.","output":"Virus shedding and environmental deposition of novel A (H1N1) pandemic influenza virus: interim findings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biosensors enable observation and understanding of latent physiological occurrences otherwise unknown or invasively detected. Wearable biosensors monitoring physiological constructs across a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions have become an important trend in innovative research methodologies. Within substance use research, explorations of biosensor technology commonly focus on identifying physiological indicators of intoxication to increase understanding of addiction etiology and to inform treatment recommendations. In this review, we examine the state of research in this area as it pertains to treatment of alcohol use disorders specifically highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge with recommendations for future research. Annually, alcohol use disorders affect approximately 15 million individuals. A primary focus of existing wearable technology-based research among people with alcohol use disorders is identifying alcohol intoxication. A large benefit of wearable biosensors for this purpose is they provide continuous readings in a passive manner compared with the gold standard measure of blood alcohol content (BAC) traditionally measured intermittently by breathalyzer or blood draw. There are two primary means of measuring intoxication with biosensors: gait and sweat. Gait changes have been measured via smart sensors placed on the wrist, in the shoe, and mobile device sensors in smart phones. Sweat measured by transdermal biosensors detects the presence of alcohol in the blood stream correlating to BAC. Transdermal biosensors have been designed in tattoos/skin patches, shirts, and most commonly, devices worn on the ankle or wrist. Transdermal devices were initially developed to help monitor court-ordered sobriety among offenders with alcohol use disorder. These devices now prove most useful in continuously tracking consumption throughout clinical trials for behavioral treatment modalities. More recent research has started exploring the uses for physical activity trackers and physiological arousal sensors to guide behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. While research has begun to demonstrate wearable devices' utility in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals aiming to cutdown on their drinking, monitoring sustained abstinence in studies exploring contingency management for alcohol use disorders, and facilitating engagement in activity-based treatment interventions, their full potential to further aid in understanding of, and treatment for, alcohol use disorders has yet to be explored.","output":"Alcohol Use Disorder in the Age of Technology: A Review of Wearable Biosensors in Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D (XPD) is a UV-sensitive syndrome and a rare incurable genetic disease which is caused by the genetic mutation of the excision repair cross-complementation group 2 gene (ERCC2).

Cultured cells derived from patients with XPD (XPD R683W cells) demonstrate a reduced nucleotide excision repair (NER) ability. We hope to ameliorate clinical symptoms if we can identify candidate agents that would aid recovery of the cells NER ability.

We present the results of a scoping review which combines the use of a novel artificial-intelligence-(AI)-assisted Medline search tool with two other traditional literature search methods. We illustrate this novel approach with a case study to identify and map the range of conditions (clinical presentations, complications, coinfections and health problems) associated with gonorrhoea infection. METHODS: To fully characterize the range of health outcomes associated with gonorrhoea, we combined a high yield preliminary search with a traditional systematic search, then supplemented with the output of a novel AI-assisted Medline search tool based on natural language processing methods to identify eligible literature. RESULTS: We identified 189 health conditions associated with gonorrhoea infection of which: 53 were identified through the initial high yield search; 99 through the systematic search; and 124 through the AI-assisted search. These were extracted from 107 unique references and 21 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD 9/10) or Read codes. Health conditions were mapped to the urogenital tract (n = 86), anorectal tract (n = 6) oropharyngeal tract (n = 5) and the eye (n = 14); and other conditions such as systemic (n = 61) and neonatal conditions (n = 7), psychosocial associations (n = 3), and co-infections (n = 7). The 107 unique references attained a Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) score of 2++ (n = 2), 2+ (14 [13%]), 2- (30 [28%]) and 3 (45 [42%]), respectively.

In this uncertain situation, we used data from a nationwide survey in Japan during February 2021, following the Japanese governments initial phase of COVID-19 vaccination. Our results show that 47% of the respondents are willing to take a vaccine once it is available, while 22% are not willing and another 31% remain indecisive. Our ordered probit regression results show that demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral variables such as gender, age, subjective health status, children, household income, household assets, financial literacy, future anxiety, and myopic view of the future are associated with willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings suggest that Japans government should not adopt a one-size-fits-all policy to promote the vaccination program, but rather target people with specific socioeconomic backgrounds who are less willing and more hesitant to take a vaccine.","output":"Willing or Hesitant?

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic. Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen.

In addition, it satisfied the OECD principles for QSAR validation. The model was validated thoroughly and fulfilled the threshold values of a battery of statistical parameters (e.g. r 2 = 0.87, Q 2 loo = 0.82). The derived model is successful in identifying many atom-pairs as important structural features that govern the anti-SARS-CoV activity of peptide-type compounds.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in forensic settings causing a serious deterioration of the primary psychiatric disorder. Aims: Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD and the role of traumatic experiences and abuse in the development of severe psychiatric disorders in a sample of psychiatric offenders. Methods: Fifty-three patients admitted in Italian high intensity therapeutic facilities-the Residenze per l'Esecuzione delle Misure di Sicurezza (REMS)-were evaluated with the Trauma Experience Checklist (TEC) and the Millon Clinical Multiaxal Inventory (MCMI-III) to study lifetime traumatic memories and general psychopathology, respectively. Results: Preliminary findings show that about 41% (N = 22) of psychiatric offenders were affected by PTSD, often not due to a single episode but to multiple lifetime traumas. Therefore, lifetime traumatic experiences and specifically sexual abuse are significant risk factors for the development of a personality disorder, which is present in the 38% (N = 20) of the sample. Conclusions: The high PTSD prevalence and the strong association found between trauma and abuse with the development of a personality disorder emphasizes the importance of an early evaluation and intervention on traumatic experiences in this difficult population of psychiatric patients; in fact, the treatment of psychiatric offenders is actually vague and devoid of scientific evidence.

Disparities in maternal health services utilization can constitute a major obstacle in the reduction of maternal mortality in Mali and indicates a lack of equity in the Malian health system. Literature on maternal health inequity has explored structural and individual factors influencing outcomes but has not examined inequities in health facility distribution within districts with moderate geographic access. The purpose of this article is to examine disparities in education and geographic distance and how they affect utilization of maternal care within the Slingu health district, a district with moderate geographic access to care, near Bamako, Mali. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional survey with cluster sampling in the Slingu health district. Maternal health services characteristics and indicators were described. Association between dependent and independent variables was verified using Kendalls tau-b correlation, Chi square, logistic regression with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Gini index and concentration curve were used to measure inequity. RESULTS: Most respondents were 20 to 24 years old. Over 31% of our sample had some education, 65% completed at least four ANC visits, and 60.8% delivered at a health facility. Despite this evidence of healthcare access in Slingu, disparities within the health district contribute to inadequate utilization among approximately 40% of the women in our sample. The concentration index demonstrated the impact of inequity in geographic access, comparing women residing near and far from the referral care facility.

AIMS: This paper is aimed at narratively reviewing various articles related to mental-health aspects of children and adolescents impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and enforcement of nationwide or regional lockdowns to prevent further spread of infection. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a review and collected articles and advisories on mental health aspects of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected articles and thematically organized them. We put up their major findings under the thematic areas of impact on young children, school and college going students, children and adolescents with mental health challenges, economically underprivileged children, impact due to quarantine and separation from parents and the advisories of international organizations. We have also provided recommendations to the above. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need for planning longitudinal and developmental studies, and implementing evidence based elaborative plan of action to cater to the psycho social and mental health needs of the vulnerable children and adolescents during pandemic as well as post pandemic. There is a need to ameliorate children and adolescents access to mental health support services geared towards providing measures for developing healthy coping mechanisms during the current crisis. For this innovative child and adolescent mental health policies policies with direct and digital collaborative networks of psychiatrists, psychologists, paediatricians, and community volunteers are deemed necessary.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 and Lockdown on Mental Health of Children and Adolescents: A Narrative Review with Recommendations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esta nota tcnica argumenta que o rigor das medidas de distanciamento social no Brasil deixou de diminuir a partir de 8-10 de maio, interrompendo uma tendncia de diminuio que vinha ocorrendo ao longo das semanas anteriores.

Little is known about the protective factors of this infection, which is equally distributed between genders and different ages while severe and poor prognosis cases are strongly associated to old males and the presence of comorbidities. Thus, preventive measures aiming at reducing the number of infection and/or their severity are strongly needed. Vitamin D has got great attention and has been claimed as potentially protective against the infection since it may be associated with immunocompetence, inflammation, aging, and those diseases involved in determining the outcomes of COVID-19. This narrative review aims at collecting the literature available on the involvement of the vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the putative utility of vitamin D supplementation in the therapeutics. It emerges that a poor vitamin D status seems to associate with an increased risk of infection whereas age, gender and comorbidities seem to play a more important role in COVID-19 severity and mortality. While randomized control trials are needed to better inquire into this topic, vitamin D supplementation may be useful beside its potential effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.","output":"Is there a link between vitamin D status, SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the popularity, reach, and variable accessibility of online platforms as channels for informal education by higher-education institutions (HEIs), it becomes practically and theoretically important to better understand the factors that affect the impact and reach of any such Internet-delivered ICT informal learning.

The objective of this study was to identify links between hMPV and influenza virus infections among children with influenza-like illness. METHOD This study was conducted in 2 influenza seasons (2002-2003 and 2003-2004) at 2 pediatric outpatient clinics in Niigata city, Japan. Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected from influenza-like illness patients, and hMPV and influenza were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A nucleotide sequence of 352 nucleotides segment of the F gene was performed. RESULTS A total of 765 influenza viruses and 84 hMPV were identified from 1498 nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates by virus isolation and RT-PCR, respectively. hMPV-positive rates in patients with influenza-like illness were 5.7 and 5.2% in the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 seasons, respectively. Epidemic curves of influenza and hMPV patients showed similar patterns with peaks in February in 2 influenza seasons. hMPV infections occurred frequently in infants and school children. Approximately 46% of hMPV patients were coinfected with influenza A viruses, but those coinfected cases were not clinically distinct from the others. No coinfection with influenza B viruses was found. Phylogenetic analysis of the hMPV fusion gene sequences revealed that 2 distinct hMPV cocirculated and that completely identical strains in subgroup A were observed over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS HMPV plays an important pathogenic role in patients with influenza-like illness in winter seasons, often in coinfections with influenza A viruses.","output":"Prevalence of human metapneumovirus and influenza virus infections among Japanese children during two successive winters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every day, a large number of people will use a hospital, creating a main air quality problem which may mean the risk of airborne infectious disease contamination in outpatient rooms, and affects human health TB, COVID-19, MERS, and SARS are a hazardous communicable disease which are spread from person to person through the air or the aerosol in different ways, such as through coughing, spitting, sneezing, speaking, or through wounds US scientists in the laboratory have shown that the virus can live in an aerosol and remain infectious for at least 3 hours A new human coronavirus now known as the serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly known as HCoV-19) emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and is now triggering a pandemic COVID-19, TB, MERS and SARS - threats and opportunities progress against deadly infection make more people sick in the hospital Therefore, we should be aware of the care and control of these diseases Consequently, good air quality management is required to control and reduce possible infected air, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration In this research, a mathematical model for the risk analysis of airborne infectious disease in an outpatient room is proposed Not only considering one type of person but also in this research, people are considered according to personal classifications There are 4 types - patient, relative, worker, and outsider, staying in an outpatient room, which is in accordance with the real world Air quality control manipulations are simulated using the inlet and outlet ventilation rates adjustment under the condition of a number of surrounding people with a personal classified factor The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) is used to approximate the model solution The proposed numerical model can be used to describe the dynamical dispersion of airborne infectious disease in an outpatient room The results of the model are satisfactory, and it will be able to control airborne disease in more complicated structures [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Engineering Letters is the property of Newswood Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A Mathematical Model for the Risk Analysis of Airborne Infectious Disease in an Outpatient Room with Personal Classification Factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many tangled normative and technical questions involved in evaluating the quality of software used in epidemiological simulations.

The world health organization declared it as public health emergency of international concern on January 2020 and later declared as pandemic on 11 March 2020.One of the high risk groups for COVID 19 disease are people residing in urban overcrowded slums and as most of the population is migrant, they are less aware of the pandemic and have less access to health care facilities. Vaccinating these high risk groups can decrease disease burden and control the ongoing pandemic.

Methodology: A community based cross sectional study was conducted in Urban slums belonging to Urban Health and Training Centre, Department of community medicine, Akash Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bengaluru Rural District, Karnataka, India. After obtaining Institutional ethical clearance and informed consent from study participants, data was collected from 1638 participants, fulfilling inclusion criteria using a predesigned, pretested, structured questionnaire. Data was entered in Microsoft excel and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Chi square test and Fischers exact test was applied and p <0.05 considered as statistically significant. Results: In the present study, 35.5% (583 out of 1638) of the study participants had taken COVID Vaccine, of which 533 (91.42%) were partially vaccinated and remaining 50 (8.5%) were fully Vaccinated. Majority i.e. 98.45% have taken vaccine at Govt health centers. 63.65% vaccinated with Covishield reported adverse events, whereas 18.6% vaccinated with Covaxin reported adverse events. Adverse events were more likely to be reported by women (74.7%) compared to men (58.6%) , this observation was consistent across all age groups. Vaccination coverage was high among 18 to 45 years age group (37.75%), males (64.86%), Christians (47.05%) followed by Hindus (43.56%), graduates (95.67%), clerical and skilled workers (70.75%), Upper middle socioeconomic class (72.41%). This difference was statistically significant. Our study reported Break through infections in 7 out of total 583 vaccinated with a prevalence of 1.2%. The break through infections was very high among partially vaccinated (85.71%) as compared to fully vaccinated individuals (14.28%). This was observed among those vaccinated with Covaxin only. Conclusion: The COVID 19 vaccine coverage was low in urban slums. The prevalence of Break through infections in our study was higher as compared to available data/reports in the country. Break through infections was very high among partially vaccinated as compared to fully vaccinated individuals. This study on break through infections on COVID vaccination is first study in South India on general population. The most important factor for vaccine hesitancy is the occurrence of mild or serious adverse effects following immunization, and this may be the biggest challenge in the global response against the pandemic.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional substudy using data from the Investigating Novel Predictions of Hypoglycemia Occurrence using Real-world Models panel survey. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: Americans 18C90 years old with type 1 or 2 diabetes taking insulin and/or secretagogues were conveniently sampled from a probability-based internet panel. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: A structured, COVID-19-specific questionnaire was administered to assess the impact of the pandemic (irrespective of infection) on socioeconomic, behavioural/clinical and psychosocial aspects of glycaemic management. RESULTS: Data from 667 respondents (type 1 diabetes: 18%; type 2 diabetes: 82%) were analysed. Almost 25% reported A1c values 8.1%. Rates of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia were 0.68 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.96) and 2.75 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.1) events per person-month, respectively. Ten respondents reported a confirmed or probable COVID-19 diagnosis. Because of the pandemic, 24% of respondents experienced difficulties affording housing; 28% struggled to maintain sufficient food to avoid hypoglycaemia; and 19% and 17% reported challenges accessing diabetes therapies and testing strips, respectively. Over one-quarter reported issues retrieving antihyperglycaemics from the pharmacy and over one-third reported challenges consulting with diabetes providers. The pandemic contributed to therapeutic non-adherence (14%), drug rationing (17%) and reduced monitoring (16%).

Methods: Hospitalized pediatric patients, 0-11 years of age, with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) were selected from 1 April 2020 through 30 September 2021 in the US Premier Healthcare Database Special Release (PHD SR). Patient characteristics, hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital costs, hospital charges, and COVID-19-associated readmission outcomes were evaluated and stratified by age groups (0-4, 5-11), four COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage, and three sequential calendar periods. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the US HealthVerity claims database and restricting the analyses to primary discharge code. Results: Among 4,573 hospitalized pediatric patients aged 0-11 years, 68.0% were 0-4 years and 32.0% were 5-11 years, with a mean (median) age of 3.2 (1) years; 56.0% were male, and 67.2% were covered by Medicaid. Among the overall study population, 25.7% had immunocompromised condition(s), 23.1% were admitted to the ICU and 7.3% received IMV. The mean (median) hospital LOS was 4.3 (2) days, hospital costs and charges were $14,760 ($6,164) and $58,418 ($21,622), respectively; in-hospital mortality was 0.5%.

However, based on published data and documents, the identification of CPV and its variant in clinically symptomatic individual dogs in Thailand through Asia is limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the emergence of CPV and to consequently establish the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the CPV strains from 209 dogs showing respiratory distress in Thailand. RESULTS: This study identified and described the full-length CPV genome from three strains, designated herein as CPV_CP13 TH/2015, CPV_CP82 TH/2016 and CPV_SR1 TH/2016, that were isolated from six dogs out of 209 dogs (2.9%) with respiratory illness in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three Thai CPV strains (CPV TH strains) belong to the CPV subgroup A and form a novel lineage; proposed as the Asian prototype. Specific mutations in the deduced amino acids of these CPV TH strains were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence, suggesting potential substitution sites for subtype classification. Results of intragenic recombination analysis revealed that CPV_CP82 TH/2016 is a recombinant strain, where the recombination event occurred in the L gene with the Italian prototype CPV Bari/100C12 as the putative major parent. Selective pressure analysis demonstrated that the majority of the nucleotides in the G/glycoprotein were under purifying selection with evidence of positive selection sites. CONCLUSIONS: This collective information on the CPV TH strains is the first evidence of CPV emergence with genetic characterization in Thailand and as first report in Asia, where homologous recombination acts as a potential force driving the genetic diversity and shaping the evolution of canine pneumovirus.

Although the WHO has recommended preventive measures to limit its spread, Brazil has neglected most of these recommendations, and consequently, our country has the second largest number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide. In addition, recent studies have shown the relationship between socioeconomic inequalities and the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Herein, we aimed to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of mortality and lethality rates of COVID-19 in a region of high social vulnerability in Brazil (Northeast region) during the first year of the pandemic. A segmented log-linear regression model was applied to assess temporal trends of mortality and case fatality rate (CFR) and according to the social vulnerability index (SVI). The Local Empirical Bayesian Estimator and Global Moran Index were used for spatial analysis. We conducted a retrospective spaceCtime scan to map clusters at high risk of death from COVID-19. A total of 66,358 COVID-19Crelated deaths were reported during this period. The mortality rate was 116.2/100,000 inhabitants, and the CFR was 2.3%. Nevertheless, CFR was > 7.5% in 27 municipalities (1.5%). We observed an increasing trend of deaths in this region (AMCP = 18.2; P = 0.001). Also, increasing trends were observed in municipalities with high (N = 859) and very high SVI (N = 587). We identified two significant spatiotemporal clusters of deaths by COVID-19 in this Brazilian region (P = 0.001), and most high-risk municipalities were on the coastal strip of the region. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that the pandemic has been responsible for several deaths in Northeast Brazil, with clusters at high risk of mortality mainly in municipalities on the coastline and those with high SVI.","output":"Spatiotemporal Pattern of COVID-19CRelated Mortality during the First Year of the Pandemic in Brazil: A Population-based Study in a Region of High Social Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite high level of health care need amongst people experiencing homelessness, poor access is a major concern. This is sometimes due to organisational and bureaucratic barriers, but also because they often feel stigmatised and treated badly when they do seek health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required social distancing measures have caused unprecedented disruption and change for the organisation of primary care, particularly for people experiencing homelessness. Against this backdrop there are many questions to address regarding whether the recent changes required to deliver services to people experiencing homelessness in the context of COVID-19 will help to address or compound problems in accessing care and inequalities in health outcomes. METHODS: An action led and participatory research methodology will be employed to address the study objectives. Interviews with people experiencing homelessness were will be conducted by a researcher with lived experience of homelessness. Researchers with lived experience are able to engage with vulnerable communities in an empathetic, non-judgemental way as their shared experience promotes a sense of trust and integrity, which in turn encourages participation in research and may help people speak more openly about their experience. The experiences of health professionals and stakeholders delivering and facilitating care for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic will also be explored. DISCUSSION: It is important to explore whether recent changes to the delivery of primary care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compromise the safety of people experiencing homelessness and exacerbate health inequalities. This could have implications for how primary healthcare is delivered to those experiencing homelessness not only for the duration of the pandemic but in the future.","output":"Exploring the experiences of changes to support access to primary health care services and the impact on the quality and safety of care for homeless people during the COVID-19 pandemic: a study protocol for a qualitative mixed methods approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to reveal the differences in the community structure of AOA between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil, to provide a theoretical basis for further study on the relationship between halophyte rhizosphere soil microorganisms and salt tolerance.

race. It is reported that SARS-CoV2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS-CoV. To explore the reason of increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV2 compared to SARS-CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)at the beginning of membrane-fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS-CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting Molecular Recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS-corona virus.

Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a conserved and major component of S. aureus cell wall. However, it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen. In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP27, which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of PGN. After immunization with MAP27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time, anti-MAP27 serum bound directly to S. aureus or PGN. Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of BALB/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge. The percentage of IFN-(+)CD3(+) T cells and IL-17(+)CD4(+) T cells in spleen, as well as the levels of IFN-, IL-17A/F and CCL3 in spleen and lung, significantly increased in the MAP27-immunized mice after infection. Moreover, in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated S. aureus with splenocytes isolated from MAP27-immunized mice stimulated the production of IFN- and IL-17A/F. Our findings demonstrated that MAP27, as a thymus-dependent antigen, is efficient at eliciting T cell-mediated responses to protect mice from S. aureus infection.

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched on April 16, 2020, to extract published articles that reported the outcomes of cancer in COVID-19 patients. The search terms were coronavirus and clinical characteristics with no language or time restrictions. We identified 512 published results and 13 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 3775 patients, of whom 63 (166%) had a cancer. The pooled estimates of ICU admission in COVID 19 patients with and without cancer were 40% versus 842%.The odds ratio of ICU admission rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups was 2.88 with a 95% CI of 118 to 701 (p = 0026). The pooled estimates of death rate in COVID -19 patients with and without cancer were 2083% versus 782%.

To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of cancers and to estimate the achievement of the main indicators of a cancer service in case of the Nizhny Novgorod Region. Subjects and methods. In the Nizhny Novgorod Region, data on the detection and registration of COVID-19 in patients with malignant neoplasms (MNs) were analyzed on the basis of data of the information and analytical system (IAS) ?Cancer Registry 6S?. Results. As of December 31, 2020, there were a total of 99.477 cancer patients, including 1.470 confirmed COVID-19 cases, accounting for 1.5% of all the registered patients with MNs. Among the cancer patients with COVID-19, the females were 1.6 times more likely to be ill than the males. Analyzing the age structure of cancer patients with COVID-19 revealed that the older ablebodied persons (61.6%) were more likely to get sick than younger ones (38.0%). Cancer concurrent with COVID-19 led to a severe course of COVID-19 in 15.9% of cases and resulted in death of cancer patients in 17.8% of cases. The older able-bodied patients were more likely to die, which accounted for 89.3% of the total number of died cancer patients with COVID-19. In the structure of the causes of death of cancer patients with COVID-19, the latter comes first (51.3%), MNs ranked next (33.0%), circulatory system diseases occupied the third place (13.0%), and other causes ranked fourth (2.7%). According to the 2020 results, the Nizhny Novgorod Region during the COVID-19 pandemic displayed a 0.4% increase in the mortality rate from neoplasms, including that from malignant ones, a 5.0% decrease in the proportion of MNs detected at Stages 1-2, a 22.0% reduction in active detection rates, and a 21.0% rise in neglect rates.

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and demographic features of COVID-19 outside Wuhan. Methods A single-center case series of 136 consecutive (from January 16 to February 17, 2020) patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, China, was retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. Results Of the 136 patients (median age, 49 years; interquartile range [IQR], 33C63 years; range, 0.3C83 years), 91 (67%) had been to Wuhan or contacted persons from Wuhan. Forty-five (33.1%) were familial clusters. The median incubation period was 6 days (IQR: 4C11 days). All children had an exact exposure history, family members with COVID-19, and Mild/Moderate symptoms at admission. Among the 64 elderly patients, 14 (21.9%) had no exposure history, and 43 (67.2%) had a chronic illness. All 11 (8.1%) Severe/Very severe illness at onset cases and 5 (3.7%) fatal cases were elderly patients. The duration from symptom onset to admission was positively correlated with the duration from symptom onset to endpoint. Overall, patients with a longer incubation period had more severe outcomes.

In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA viruses. METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(+) plasmid, generating pET47b(+)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.","output":"Internal control for real-time polymerase chain reaction based on MS2 bacteriophage for RNA viruses diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current epidemic situation due to COVID-19 is a public health disaster worldwide.

Methods Over a 2-month period, contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and severe inflammatory state. Results Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range, 2C16 years). Comorbidities were present in 28%, including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one-third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin-6 median, 135pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median, 5284ng/mL). Mean BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) was elevated (5743pg/mL).

Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19. METHODS: A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic.

Twenty type 1 diabetes adult participants established on insulin pump therapy used the CBX IIS for two 7-day test periods while wearing a Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitor. RESULTS Participants were able to wear the CBX IIS for an average of 6.61.4 days. Eighty-eight percent (36/41) of sets were worn for 7 days. No serious adverse events were reported. Five infusion sets failed prematurely due to: unresolvable hyperglycaemia (3); hyperglycaemia with elevated ketones (1); or infection (1). Median time in range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) was 62% [54--76]. Average glucose levels per day of infusion set wear showed a statistically significant increase over time (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary observations confirm the tolerability of the prototype CBX IIS for extended wear, albeit with a deterioration in glucose control after the third day.

Here, we present a new network-based methodology to analyze COVID-19 data measures containing spatial and temporal features and its application on a real dataset. The goal of the methodology is to analyze sets of homogeneous datasets (i.e. COVID-19 data taken in different periods and in several regions) using a statistical test to find similar/dissimilar datasets, mapping such similarity information on a graph and then using a community detection algorithm to visualize and analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of data. We evaluated diverse Italian COVID-19 data made publicly available by the Italian Protezione Civile Department at https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/. Furthermore, we considered the climate data related to two periods and we integrated them with COVID-19 data measures to detect new communities related to climate changes.

Since their introduction in 2011, they have become increasingly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis has driven institutions to examine such innovative solutions to manage patient care. The current controversies include quantifying safety outcomes, such as potential delayed or missed injuries, inadequate treatment, and medicolegal claims. Questions also exist regarding the potential for cost reductions and efficiencies that may be achieved. Physical distancing has limited the number of face-to-face consultations, so this review was conducted to determine if virtual fracture clinics can provide an acceptable alternative in these challenging times. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The aim of this systematic review was to describe (1) adverse outcomes, (2) cost reductions, and (3) efficiencies associated with the virtual fracture clinic model. METHODS: A systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted from database inception to March 2020. The keywords \\"virtual\\" or \\"telemedicine\\" or \\"telehealth\\" or \\"remote\\" or \\"electronic\\" AND \\"fracture\\" or \\"trauma\\" or \\"triage\\" AND \\"clinic\\" or \\"consultation\\" were entered, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria included adults and children treated for injuries by a virtual clinic model at the initial review. Eligible injuries included injuries deemed to not need surgical intervention, and those able to be treated remotely using defined protocols. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients reviewed by telemedicine using video links or in person at the initial review. Initially, 1065 articles were identified, with 665 excluded as they did not relate to virtual fracture clinics. In all, 400 articles were screened for eligibility, and 27 full-text reviews were conducted on 18 studies (30,512 virtual fracture clinic encounters). Three subdomains focusing on adverse outcomes, cost reductions, and efficiencies were recorded. The term adverse outcomes was used to describe any complications, further surgeries, re-referrals back to the clinic, or deviations from the protocols. Efficiency described the number of patients reviewed and discharged using the model, savings in clinic slots, reduced waiting times, or a reduction in consumption of resources such as radiographs. All studies were observational and the quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool, which demonstrated a median score of 6  1.8, indicating moderate quality. RESULTS: Six studies reported adverse outcomes in detail, with events ranging from inappropriate splinting, deviations from protocols, and one patient underwent an osteotomy for a malunion. Efficiency varied from direct discharge proportions of 18% in early studies to 100% once the virtual fracture clinic model was more established. Cost reductions compared with estimates derived from conventional fracture clinics varied from USD 53 to USD 297 and USD 39,125 to USD 305876 compared with traditional fracture clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual fracture clinics may provide a means to treat patients remotely, using agreed-upon protocols. They have an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to the possibility to provide ongoing care in an otherwise challenging setting. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long-term effects on patients, institutions, and health care systems.

Primary method of transmission was firstly thought to be animal to human transmission. However, it has been observed that the virus is transmitted from human to human via respiratory droplets. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from patient stools, suggesting a possible gastrointestinal (GI) involvement. Most commonly reported clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Interestingly, a small percentage of patients experience GI symptoms with the most common being anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The presence of viral RNA in stools is also common and fecal tests can be positive even after negative respiratory samples. The exact incidence of digestive symptoms is a matter of debate. The distribution of Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptors in multiple organs in the body provides a possible explanation for the digestive symptoms mechanism. Cases with solely GI symptoms have been reported in both adults and children. Viral RNA has also been detected in stool and blood samples, indicating the possibility of liver damage, which has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The presence of chronic liver disease appears to be a risk factor for severe complications and a poorer prognosis, however data from these cases is lacking. The aim of this review is firstly, to briefly update what is known about the origin and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but mainly to focus on the manifestations of the GI tract and their pathophysiological background, so that physicians on the one hand, not to underestimate or disregard digestive symptoms due to the small number of patients exhibiting exclusively this symptomatology and on the other, to have SARS-CoV-2 on their mind when the gastroenteritis type symptoms predominate.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: Pathophysiology and manifestations from the gastrointestinal tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted acute stroke care logistics, including delays in hyperacute management and decreased monitoring following endovascular therapy (EVT).

METHODS: This is an observational cohort study including all patients evaluated for an acute stroke between March 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (pandemic cohort) and 2019 (reference cohort) in a high-volume Canadian academic stroke center. We collected baseline characteristics, acute reperfusion treatment and management metrics. For EVT-treated patients, we assessed the modified Rankin score (mRS) at 90 days. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on a 90-day favourable functional status (defined as mRS 0C2) and death using multivariable logistic regressions. RESULTS: Among 383 and 339 patients included in the pandemic and reference cohorts, baseline characteristics were similar. Delays from symptom onset to evaluation and in-house treatment were longer during the early first wave, but returned to reference values in the subsequent months. Among the 127 and 136 EVT-treated patients in each respective cohort, favourable 90-day outcome occurred in 53/99 (53%) vs 52/109 (48%, p=0.40), whereas 22/99 (22%) and 28/109 (26%, p=0.56) patients died.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal liver tests on admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 1611 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through July 31, 2020 in 38 different Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters, including liver function tests, on admission and during hospitalization. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We fit multivariable logistic regression models, further post-estimation effect through margins and inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Overall, 57.8% of the patients were male with a mean age of 52.3 years, 8.5% had chronic liver disease and 3.4% had cirrhosis. Abnormal liver tests on admission were present on 45.2% (CI 42.7C47.7) of the cohort (n = 726). Overall, 15.1% (CI 13.4C16.9) of patients died (n = 244). Patients with abnormal liver tests on admission presented higher mortality 18.7% (CI 15.9C21.7), compared to those with normal liver biochemistries 12.2% (CI 10.1C14.6); P < .0001).

They have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated Spike than the original virus. It is possible that novel variants with abilities of enhanced transmissibility and/or immunoevasion will appear in the near future and perfectly escape from vaccine-elicited immunity. Therefore, the current vaccines may need to be improved to compensate for the viral evolution. For this purpose, it may be beneficial to take advantage of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of CTLs on the viral control in COVID-19, and CTLs target a wide range of proteins involving comparatively conserved non-structural proteins. Here, we identified twenty-two HLA-A*24:02-restricted CTL candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV-2 using computational algorithms, HLA-A*24:02 transgenic mice and the peptide-encapsulated liposomes. We focused on pp1a and HLA-A*24:02 because pp1a is relatively conserved and HLA-A*24:02 is predominant in East Asians such as Japanese. The conservation analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of 7 out of the 22 epitopes were hardly affected by a number of mutations in the Sequence Read Archive database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The information of such conserved epitopes might be useful for designing the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that is universally effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variants by the induction of both anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies and CTLs specific for conserved epitopes.

However, there are currently no studies in the country that provide a quantitative assessment of the ability of the disease to spread during these outbreaks. This limits our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease especially for planning and implementing quantifiable and cost-effective control measures. To fill this gap, the basic reproduction number, R(0), for bubonic plague was estimated in this study, using data from the 2015 Nyimba district outbreak, in the Eastern province of Zambia. R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infectious individual during their infectious period in an entirely susceptible population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Secondary epidemic data for the most recent 2015 Nyimba district bubonic plague outbreak in Zambia was analyzed. R(0) was estimated as a function of the average epidemic doubling time based on the initial exponential growth rate of the outbreak and the average infectious period for bubonic plague. R(0) was estimated to range between 1.5599 [95% CI: 1.382C1.7378] and 1.9332 [95% CI: 1.6366C2.2297], with average of 1.7465 [95% CI: 1.5093C1.9838].

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A convenience sample of therapists (physical and occupational) and students were enrolled in pairs in a cohort study with pre- versus post-training comparisons. The intervention was a hybrid of self-study and hands-on practice paired with remote feedback for ten intermediate and advanced manual wheelchair skills. Participants practiced with self-selected frequency and duration, uploading a session log and video(s) to an online platform. A remote trainer provided asynchronous feedback prior to the next practice session. Capacity and confidence in completing the ten skills were evaluated using the Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q). Knowledge of wheelchair skills training and motor learning was assessed using a 62-item Knowledge Test. Secondary outcome measures included skill achievement, as confirmed by submitted video recordings, and participant feedback about the training. RESULTS: Across 41participants, scores were higher at follow-up compared to baseline for WST-Q capacity (73.9  19.1 vs 16.8  15.6, p < 0.001), WST-Q confidence (80.1  12.2 vs 47.6  18.2, p = 0.003) and knowledge (70.8  7.5 vs 67.0  5.4, p = 0.004).

SARS-CoV-2 induces syncytia when the viral spike (S) protein on the surface of an infected cell interacts with receptors on neighboring cells. Syncytia may potentially contribute to pathology by facilitating viral dissemination, cytopathicity, immune evasion, and inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern possess several mutations within the S protein that enhance receptor interaction, fusogenicity and antibody binding. In this review, we discuss the molecular determinants of S mediated fusion and the antiviral innate immunity components that counteract syncytia formation.

Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that >80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with transient wheeze that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype.

Many of these patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for invasive ventilation and are at significant risk of developing a secondary, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). OBJECTIVES: To study the incidence of VAP and bacterial lung microbiome composition of ventilated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we compared the incidence of VAP and secondary infections using a combination of microbial culture and a TaqMan multi-pathogen array. In addition, we determined the lung microbiome composition using 16S RNA analysis in a subset of samples. The study involved 81 COVID-19 and 144 non-COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation in a single University teaching hospital between March 15th 2020 and August 30th 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to develop VAP than patients without COVID (Cox proportional hazard ratio 2.01 95% CI 1.14-3.54, p = 0.0015) with an incidence density of 28/1000 ventilator days versus 13/1000 for patients without COVID (p = 0.009). Although the distribution of organisms causing VAP was similar between the two groups, and the pulmonary microbiome was similar, we identified 3 cases of invasive aspergillosis amongst the patients with COVID-19 but none in the non-COVID-19 cohort. Herpesvirade activation was also numerically more frequent amongst patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of VAP, which is not fully explained by the prolonged duration of ventilation.

The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively). Co-infection with multiple viruses was found in 92 samples (45.1%) and 29 samples (29.9%), respectively; this was most frequent in the 12C24 months age group. The most frequently observed co-infection patterns were RSVRhinovirus (23 patients, 11.3%, GENDRES cohort) and RSVbocavirus / bocavirusinfluenza (5 patients, 5.2%, UK cohort).

Infected patients may then develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiovascular (CV) complications. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its bioactive metabolites favorably modulate inflammation and EC function. These benefits of EPA may contribute to reduced CV events as reported in outcome trials (REDUCE-IT). Currently, EPA is being tested in patients with or at risk for COVID-19. This study tested the effects of either EPA pre- or post-treatment on global protein expression in human pulmonary ECs under conditions of inflammation using the cytokine IL-6 to simulate conditions of advanced viral infections. METHODS: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were pre-treated with either EPA (40 M) or IL-6 (12 ng/mL) for 2 hr and then treated with IL-6 or EPA, respectively, for 24 hr in media with 2% FBS. Proteomic analysis was performed using LC/MS to assess relative protein expression levels. Only significant (p< 0.05) changes in protein expression between treatment groups >1-fold were analyzed. Expression of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) was separately measured with immunochemistry. RESULTS: HMVEC-L pre- and post-treated with EPA during challenge with IL-6 showed significant changes in 100 (49/51 up/down) and 441 (229/212 up/down) proteins, respectively, compared with IL-6 treatment alone. Among the 31 proteins that were significantly modulated by both EPA pre- and post-treatment, thioredoxin reductase 1 increased relative to IL-6 alone, while matrix metalloproteinase 1 and fibronectin both decreased. Other proteins, such as hypoxia up-regulated protein 1, were differentially modulated by EPA relative to IL-6 (increased in pre-treatment, decreased in post-treatment). Finally, EPA significantly reduced sICAM- 1expression by 41% and 12% compared with IL-6 alone in the pre- and post-treatment models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EPA favorably modulates the expression of multiple inflammatory and cytoprotective proteins during inflammation. These studies support a broad anti-inflammatory effect of EPA on pulmonary ECs that may have therapeutic implications for patients at risk for ARDS due to infectious agents including SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses.","output":"Eicosapentaenoic acid favorably modulates protein expression in pulmonary endothelial inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Population-based seroprevalence studies offer comprehensive characterization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, but barriers exist and marginalized populations may not be captured.

METHODS: Data were collected on decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination in Maryland from 24 May through 30 November 2020 from whom a blood specimen could be collected. Those with available blood specimens were tested with the CoronaCHEK lateral flow antibody assay. We assessed monthly seroprevalence compared to the statewide estimated number of cases and proportion of positive test results (testing positivity). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of demographic characteristics, homelessness, and manner of death with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Among 1906 decedents, 305 (16%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Monthly seroprevalence increased from 11% to 22% over time and was consistently higher than state-level estimates of testing positivity. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 2- to 3.2-fold higher seropositivity (P < .05) irrespective of sex.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to NYC Health + Hospitals / Bellevue Hospital from March 9(th) to April 8(th), 2020. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Primary analyses were conducted among those requiring supplemental oxygen (n = 270); half of these patients (135) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A majority were male (67.4%) and the median age was 58 years. Approximately one-third (32.6%) of hypoxic patients managed outside the ICU required non-rebreather or non-invasive ventilation. Requirement of renal replacement therapy occurred in 42.3% of ICU patients without baseline end-stage renal disease. Overall, 30-day mortality among hypoxic patients was 28.9% (53.3% in the ICU, 4.4% outside the ICU).

Factors associated with positive frailty screening tests (defined as GS < 0.8 m/s, TUGT  10 s and SRH score < 6) were assessed using logistic regression models. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This was a service evaluation and was approved as a service evaluation by the Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust HIV clinical research committee (February 2020).

Increasing energy and nutritional efficiency while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts of pork production requires the adoption of precision nutrition practices in global pork production systems. Precision swine nutrition can only be achieved by using more accurate and comprehensive methods and measures to determine the true nutri-physiological value of feed ingredients used in swine diets. There are several characteristics in some types of feed ingredients that are detrimental to swine health and performance, but they are seldom measured and deserve greater consideration. Likewise, there are also several value-added benefits provided by some functional feed ingredients that are not given enough consideration when formulating swine diets. The purpose of this review is to provide a holistic assessment of the benefits and limitations of existing chemical analysis methods and measures used to evaluate feed ingredients for swine and explore the benefits of using additional measurements to more accurately assess their true nutri-physiological value. ABSTRACT: Many types of feed ingredients are used to provide energy and nutrients to meet the nutritional requirements of swine. However, the analytical methods and measures used to determine the true nutritional and physiological (nutri-physiological) value of feed ingredients affect the accuracy of predicting and achieving desired animal responses. Some chemical characteristics of feed ingredients are detrimental to pig health and performance, while functional components in other ingredients provide beneficial health effects beyond their nutritional value when included in complete swine diets. Traditional analytical procedures and measures are useful for determining energy and nutrient digestibility of feed ingredients, but do not adequately assess their true physiological or biological value. Prediction equations, along with ex vivo and in vitro methods, provide some benefits for assessing the nutri-physiological value of feed ingredients compared with in vivo determinations, but they also have some limitations. Determining the digestion kinetics of the different chemical components of feed ingredients, understanding how circadian rhythms affect feeding behavior and the gastrointestinal microbiome of pigs, and accounting for the functional properties of many feed ingredients in diet formulation are the emerging innovations that will facilitate improvements in precision swine nutrition and environmental sustainability in global pork-production systems.","output":"Measures MatterDetermining the True Nutri-Physiological Value of Feed Ingredients for Swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While the number of pulmonary tuberculosis cases has decreased, increase in non-tuberculous mycobacterium pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is a global problem. Guideline-based therapy for NTM-PD sometimes causes complications that prevent treatment completion, and there are many cases of relapse even if the treatment can be completed. In addition to antibacterial treatment, care of host risk factors, such as aging, lean physique and immunosuppressive state, is also very important for the management of NTM-PD. In Japan, Kampo medicine, a traditional Japanese herbal formulation, used alone or in combination with standard multidrug therapy for NTM-PD, has been found to be effective for such cases. Case Presentation: A 77-year-old lean woman had been diagnosed with Mycobacterium intracellulare pulmonary infection 6 years earlier, and had received the standard multidrug treatment 5 years later at a former hospital due to worsening of her symptoms of cough, breathlessness and hemoptysis. However, the treatment was discontinued within a year due to the development of adverse events. She refused the guideline-based antibacterial treatment, and asked for Kampo medicine instead. Bukuryoshigyakuto was subsequently prescribed, which led to cough and sputum, especially hemosputum, being well controlled. With 3 years of Kampo medicine treatment, she gained weight and her hemosputum disappeared. High-resolution computed tomography images showed improvement in her lung condition, and her sputum smear culture was negative for acid-fast bacillus. Conclusion: Various kinds of Kampo medicines have been used empirically for NTM-PD in Japan. A literature review from 1992 to 2020 showed that hozais, in particular, seem to be key drugs for the treatment of host NTM-PD risk factors. Kampo medicines can contribute to comprehensive treatment for NTM-PD management that does not rely solely on antibacterial drugs.","output":"Case Report: Kampo Medicine for Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Pulmonary Disease"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,p)=>(i(),y(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/66.md","filePath":"drive/66.md"}'),R={name:"drive/66.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
