While the incidence of end-stage kidney disease continues to increase globally, the use of home dialysis remains low in most developed countries. Multiple barriers to providing home dialysis have been noted in the published literature. Amongst known challenges, gaps in clinician knowledge are potentially addressable with a focused education strategy. Recent national surveys in the United States and Australia have highlighted the need for enhanced home dialysis knowledge especially among nephrologists who have recently completed training. Traditional in-person continuing professional educational programs have had modest success in promoting home dialysis and are limited by scale and the present global COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the use of a \\"Hub and Spoke\\" model of virtual home dialysis mentorship for nephrologists based on project ECHO would support home dialysis growth.

However, numbers of infected cases, deaths, and mortality rates related to COVID-19 vary from country to country. Although many studies were conducted, the reasons of these differences have not been clarified. In this study, we comprehensively investigated 12,343 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients/individuals in six geographic areas and identified a total of 1234 mutations by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Through a hierarchical clustering based on the mutant frequencies, we classified the 28 countries into three clusters showing different fatality rates of COVID-19. In correlation analyses, we identified that ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are in a strong linkage disequilibrium, showed significant positive correlations with fatality rates (r = 0.41, P = 0.029 and r = 0.43, P = 0.022, respectively). We found that BCG-vaccination status significantly associated with the fatality rates as well as number of infected cases. In BCG-vaccinated countries, the frequency of the S 614G variant had a trend of association with the higher fatality rate. We also found that the frequency of several HLA alleles, including HLA-A*11:01, were significantly associated with the fatality rates, although these factors were associated with number of infected cases and not an independent factor to affect fatality rate in each country. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as BCG-vaccination status and a host genetic factor, HLA genotypes might affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations associated with mortality rate of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been demonstrated that salivary gland duct cells have similar receptors as ACE2-positive cells/keratin epithelial cells of the lung which have high potential to be infected by SARS-CoV 2 virus.

Prior to the pandemic, online education was providing higher education to students who were returning to study to up-skill, are employed full-time, caring for family members, living rurally or remotely and/or for whom otherwise face-to-face campus learning was not a preference or option. To understand how we can better support online students in their unique circumstances and create an optimal learning environment, we must understand the factors associated with academic achievement within an online setting. This systematic review involved a search of relevant databases published between January 2009 and May 2021 examining factors and constructs related to academic performance in online higher education settings. Across 34 papers, 23 (67.6%) explored factors and constructs related to student characteristics including cognitive and psychological, demographic, university enrolment, and prior academic performance. Twenty-one (61.8%) papers explored learning environment factors including engagement, student experience, course design, and instructor. Our overall synthesis of findings indicates that academic performance in online learning is most strongly associated with motivation (including self-efficacy), and self-regulation. We propose three main implications of our review for online learning stakeholders such as educators and designers. Firstly, we argue that the wellbeing of online learners is important to understand, and future research should explore its impact on students experience and success in online higher education. Secondly, we emphasise the importance of developing and designing online courses utilising relevant frameworks and evidence-based principles. Finally, we propose an approach to promoting improved student cognitive and psychosocial experiences (such as self-efficacy, self-regulation, and perceived support) could be achieved by creating and incorporating an online learning orientation module at the commencement of enrolment.

Strategies for vaccine development include complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in their early stages.

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study to determine the impact of food insecurity on HIV outcomes in Senegal, West Africa. METHODS: HIV-infected individuals presenting for care and initiation of ART through the Senegalese National AIDS program in Dakar and Ziguinchor were eligible for enrollment. Data were collected using interviews, clinical evaluations, laboratory analyses, and chart review at enrollment, month 6, and month 12. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between food insecurity and HIV outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 207 participants in this study, 70% were female and the median age was 37 years. The majority (69%) were food insecure at enrollment, 29% were severely food insecure, and 38% were undernourished. Nearly a third (32%) had no formal education, 23% practiced agriculture, and 40% owned livestock. The median daily food expenditure per person was $0.58. The median round trip transportation time to clinic was 90 min (IQR 30C240). The median cost of transportation to clinic was $1.74. At month 12, 69% were food insecure, 23% were severely food insecure, and 14% were undernourished. At month 12, 43% had not disclosed their HIV status; food insecurity was associated with non-disclosure of HIV-status due to fear of stigmatization and feelings of shame. Severe food insecurity was a strong predictor of loss to follow-up (OR 3.13 [1.08C9.06]) and persistent severe food insecurity was associated with virologic failure (OR 5.14 [1.01C26.29]) and poor adherence to ART 8.00 [1.11C57.57]. Poor nutritional status was associated with poor immunologic recovery (OR 4.24 [1.56C11.47]), virologic failure (OR 3.39 [1.13C10.21]), and death (OR 3.35 [1.40C8.03]). CONCLUSION: Severity and duration of food insecurity are important factors in understanding the relationship between food insecurity and HIV outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of nutritional status, socioeconomic opportunity, and self-stigmatization in the complex pathway between food insecurity and HIV outcomes. Interdisciplinary, multisectoral efforts are needed to develop and implement effective interventions to address food insecurity among people living with HIV.

The ABCD score was compared to the individualized metabolic surgery (IMS) score in terms of prediction of T2DM remission, but which of the two scoring systems is better remains controversial. METHODS: Patient data from 463 obese East Asian patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or SG with duodenojejunal bypass (SG-DJB) as a primary operation and were followed for at least 3 years were retrospectively collected from 24 institutions. The correlation between the ABCD and IMS scoring systems and the discrimination power of the models was evaluated. The cut-off point for the IMS stage of T2DM severity was also revised to adjust the scoring system to obese East Asian patients. RESULTS: The two scoring systems were significantly well correlated. The IMS scoring system showed significant differences in T2DM remission rates between the procedures in the moderate stage, but the ABCD score showed no significant differences in each category. The discrimination power of the IMS score was comparable to that of the ABCD score at both 3 and 5 years. The revised IMS scoring system showed that SG-DJB had significantly higher T2DM remission rates in the moderate stage at 5 years than RYGB or SG.

An ability to predict the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at the scale of a single large population would help to accurately assess the value of interventions designed to reduce that peak. However, current disease-dynamic theory does not provide a clear understanding of the relationship between: epidemic trajectories at the scale of interest (e.g. city); population mobility; and higher resolution spatial effects (e.g. transmission within small neighbourhoods). Here, we used a spatially-explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution to determine the effect of resolution on model-derived epidemic trajectories. We simulated an influenza-like pathogen spreading across theoretical and actual population densities and varied our assumptions about mobility using Latin-Hypercube sampling. Even though, by design, cumulative attack rates were the same for all resolutions and mobilities, peak incidences were different. Clear thresholds existed for all tested populations, such that models with resolutions lower than the threshold substantially overestimated population-wide peak incidence. The effect of resolution was most important in populations which were of lower density and lower mobility. With the expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets in the near future, our objective was to provide a framework for how to use these data correctly in a spatial meta-population model. Our results suggest that there is a fundamental spatial resolution for any pathogen-population pair.

However, it is unknown whether COVID-19 pandemic has differentially affected sleep and mental health depending on the circadian type. Here, the differences in sleep and mental health between circadian types are examined globally before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The sample collected between May and August 2020 across 12 countries/regions consisted of 19 267 adults with information on their circadian type. Statistical analyses were performed by using Complex Sample procedures, stratified by country and weighted by the number of inhabitants in the country/area of interest and by the relative number of responders in that country/area. RESULTS: Evening-types had poorer mental health, well-being, and quality of life or health than other circadian types during the pandemic. SleepCwake schedules were delayed especially on working days, and evening-types reported an increase in sleep duration. Sleep problems increased in all circadian types, but especially among evening-types, moderated by financial suffering and confinement. Intermediate-types were less vulnerable to sleep changes, although morningness protected from most sleep problems. These findings were confirmed after adjusting for age, sex, duration of the confinement, or socio-economic status during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an alarming increase in sleep and mental health problems, especially among evening-types as compared to other circadian types during the pandemic.","output":"Evening-types show highest increase of sleep and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemicmultinational study on 19 267 adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of RT-LAMP (reverse transcriptaseloop mediated isothermal amplification) has been considered as a promising point-of-care method to diagnose COVID-19. In this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. We also demonstrated that this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without any viral infection.

Orange colors should be repeated or tested by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic. RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test. All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 C.

Participants were asked to answer the dehumanization questionnaire, the mechanistic self-dehumanization scale, the human nature and human uniqueness characteristics questionnaire, and the adult attachment questionnaire. Results It was found that patients with organic disease and patients with psychosis do not perform mechanistic and animalistic dehumanization of themselves. Still, it seems that insecure attachment (anxiety and obsession) contributes positively to their mechanistic dehumanization and negatively to their mechanistic self-dehumanization. From the insecure attachment, only the dimensions of stress and obsession affect the mechanistic dehumanization.

Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined.

This presentation reviews research on how ERI moderates associations between discrimination and mental health, academics, risky health behaviors, and physical health. Research on whether ERI buffers or exacerbates the detrimental impact of discrimination differs by ERI, age, ethnic/racial group, and outcome. Methods: This presentation includes results from 2 studies. The first is a meta-analysis of over 50 studies and 18,000 participants. The second is a study focused on vicarious racismwitnessing or hearing about other individuals of ones ethnic/racial group being the target of racismexperienced among Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 600;ages 18-88 years). Results: Meta-analytic data found that having a strong overall sense of ERI conferred protection against discrimination stress, mitigating the impact of racism on health outcomes. However, results also differ by various subdimensions of ERI. Individuals who reported high levels of identity search and exploration were more negatively impacted by discrimination, and this association was most evident at age 24 years. On the other hand, individuals who reported high levels of comfort and commitment to their ethnic/racial identity were more protected from the negative impact of discrimination. Compared to Asian- and African-heritage individuals, Latinx respondents benefited from a strong ethnic/racial identity especially for risky health behaviors. Data from the second study of Asian Americans (April to June 2020) suggest that experiences of vicarious racism were associated with poorer sleep quality;this effect was attenuated for individuals reporting high levels of centrality. Conclusions: The development of an ERI offers social bonds and a sense of belonging and common fate between similar others. Existing research finds that a strong sense of ERI confers overall positive health benefits, suggesting that 1 mechanism for promoting health may be through mitigating the impact of racism among individuals who have a clear and committed sense of their ERI group membership. However, individuals who are still unclear or exploring their ERI may be particularly susceptible to the negative health impact of racism.

The role of the Fc fragment of this antibody as well as the involvement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytolysis towards protection was evaluated in vivo. Passive immunization with the Fab fragment alone (618C907 g mouse?1) was unable to confer protection in mice. Furthermore, we passively immunized with the mAb 18A2B2 SCID beige mice, which are deficient in natural killer (NK) cell activity, to ascertain the role of NK cells in the protective mechanism. These mice were free of virus 5 days following viral challenge, indicating that NK cells do not contribute significantly towards the protective action of this antibody. Moreover, passively immunized BALB c mice decomplemented with 8C10 U of cobra venom factor (CoVF) and DBA 2J mice (C5 deficient) were only partially protected. These findings suggest that in mice the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system are involved in the passive protection mechanism conferred by the non-neutralizing mAb 18A2B2.

Objective To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses. Design, Setting, and Participants This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19). Main Outcomes and Measures Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method. Results A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31).

These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners' skill retention. Future work will focus on implementing similar train-the-trainers strategies for other health professions, specialties, and high-risk or rare procedures.","output":"Rapid Dissemination of a COVID-19 Airway Management Simulation Using a Train-the-Trainers Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses highly pathogenic to humans.

The role of selenium is mainly played through selenoproteins synthesized by the selenium metabolic system. Selenoproteins have a wide range of cellular functions including regulation of selenium transport, thyroid hormones, immunity, and redox homeostasis. Selenium deficiency contributes to various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver disease, and arthropathyKashinCBeck disease (KBD) and osteoarthritis (OA). A skeletal developmental disorder, KBD has been reported in low-selenium areas of China, North Korea, and the Siberian region of Russia, and can be alleviated by selenium supplementation. OA, the most common form of arthritis, is a degenerative disease caused by an imbalance in matrix metabolism and is characterized by cartilage destruction. Oxidative stress serves as a major cause of the initiation of OA pathogenesis. Selenium deficiency and dysregulation of selenoproteins are associated with impairments to redox homeostasis in cartilage. We review the recently explored roles of selenium metabolism and selenoproteins in cartilage with an emphasis on two arthropathies, KBD and OA.

That said, the results also highlighted the importance of health literacy. It is found that even though high health literacy does not guarantee a low degree of conspiracy beliefs, low health literacy is associated with high susceptibility to both misinformation and conspiracy theories. Moreover, people who relied more on social media than mass media for COVID-19 news and reported on having been more severely affected by the pandemic were found to be more likely to have lower health literacy and higher belief in misinformation and conspiracy theories.

METHODS: Data were collected using ethnographic methods and semi\\\\structured interviews among 16 nurses working in the COVID\\\\19 ward of a rural community hospital in Japan. A grounded theory approach was used for the qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In total, 70 hours' observation and participation were completed, and 27 pages of field notes were taken and used for the analysis. In addition, 32 interviews were conducted with 16 participants. Four themes emerged from the data: preCCOVID\\\\work perceptions, overcoming fear, shadow cast by working in the COVID\\\\19 ward, and an integrated approach to the fear of COVID\\\\19. The nurses initially felt unpredictable fear. However, the establishment of standard approaches and practices for COVID\\\\19 gave them confidence in their safety and helped them regain sympathy for patients. Nevertheless, working on COVID\\\\19 cases negatively affected their activities outside of the ward, and some of them developed an identity crisis as they feared for the future. CONCLUSION: Better teamwork, comprehensive understanding of COVID\\\\19, and continuous provision of proper knowledge in rural hospitals should be driven by appropriate understanding and sympathy for nurses and patients in COVID\\\\19 wards. The results of this study can be applied to mitigate nurses' fear, improve teamwork, and ensure understanding of COVID\\\\19 by all medical staff in rural hospitals.","output":"Overcoming the challenge of COVID\\\\19: A grounded theory approach to rural nurses' experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterise the self-isolating household units (bubbles) during the COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown in New Zealand. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, an online survey was distributed to a convenience sample via Facebook advertising and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealands social media platforms and mailing list. Respondents were able to share a link to the survey via their own social media platforms and by email. Results were collected over 6 days during Alert Level 4 from respondents living in New Zealand, aged 16 years and over. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean size of a self-isolating household unit or bubble. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of households in each bubble, the proportion of bubbles containing essential workers and/or vulnerable people, and the mean number of times the home was left each week. RESULTS: 14 876 surveys were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) bubble size was 3.58 (4.63) people, with mean (SD) number of households 1.26 (0.77). The proportion of bubbles containing one or more essential workers, or one or more vulnerable persons was 45.3% and 42.1%, respectively. The mean number of times individual bubble members left their home in the previous week was 12.9 (12.4). Bubbles that contained at least one vulnerable individual had fewer outings over the previous week compared with bubbles that did not contain a vulnerable person. The bubble sizes were similar by respondent ethnicity. CONCLUSION: In this New Zealand convenience sample, bubble sizes were small, mostly limited to one household, and a high proportion contained essential workers and/or vulnerable people.

The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the epidemiological aspects of RSV (incidence, prevalence, seasonality and hospitalisation status) and the associated molecular data in the WPRO countries. Methods A systematic search was conducted in international literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science) to identify RSV-related publications from January 2000 to October 2017 in the WPR countries. Results A total of 196 studies from 15 WPR countries were included. The positivity rate for RSV among respiratory tract infection patients was 16.73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 15.12%-18.4%). The RSV-positive cases were mostly found in hospitalised compared with outpatients (18.28% vs 11.54%, P < 0.001), and children compared with adults (20.72% vs 1.87%, P < 0.001). The seasonality of RSV in the WPR countries follows the latitude, with the peak of RSV season occurring in the winter in temperate countries, and during the rainy season in tropical countries. The molecular epidemiology pattern of RSV in WPR countries was similar to the global pattern, with NA1 (RSV A) and BA (RSV B) being the predominant genotypes. Conclusions The available data on RSV are limited in several countries within the WPR, with most data focusing on children and hospitalised patients.

Development of well-tolerated regimens with high cure rates and fewer side effects is still much needed. Recently, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting more attention as biological compounds and can be a good template to develop therapeutic agents, including antiviral agents against a variety of viruses. Various AMPs have been characterized from the venom of different venomous animals including scorpions. METHODS: The possible antiviral activities of crude venoms obtained from five Egyptian scorpion species (Leiurus quinquestriatus, Androctonus amoreuxi, A. australis, A. bicolor and Scorpio maurus palmatus) were evaluated by a cell culture method using Huh7.5 cells and the J6/JFH1-P47 strain of HCV. Time-of-addition experiments and inactivation of enzymatic activities of the venoms were carried out to determine the characteristics of the anti-HCV activities. RESULTS: S. maurus palmatus and A. australis venoms showed anti-HCV activities, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) being 6.3  1.6 and 88.3  5.8 g/ml, respectively. S. maurus palmatus venom (30 g/ml) impaired HCV infectivity in culture medium, but not inside the cells, through virocidal effect. The anti-HCV activity of this venom was not inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor or heating at 60C. The antiviral activity was directed preferentially against HCV. CONCLUSIONS: S. maurus palmatus venom is considered as a good natural source for characterization and development of novel anti-HCV agents targeting the entry step. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing antiviral activities of Egyptian scorpion venoms against HCV, and may open a new approach towards discovering antiviral compounds derived from scorpion venoms.","output":"Virocidal activity of Egyptian scorpion venoms against hepatitis C virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has become a recognizable complication in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Alveolar damage in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to be the culprit in facilitating fungal invasion in COVID-19 patients, leading to a COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) phenomenon. From November 2020 to 15 February 2021, 248 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICUs, of whom ten patients (4% incidence) were classified as either probable (six) or possible (four) CAPA cases. Seven patients had positive cultural results: Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto (five), A. terreus sensu stricto (one), and A. welwitschiae (one). Five patients had positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and galactomannan (GM), and two patients had both positive cultural and GM criteria. All but two patients received voriconazole. Mortality rate was 30%. Strict interpretation of classic IPA definition would have resulted in eight overlooked CAPA cases. Broader diagnostic criteria are essential in this context, even though differentiation between Aspergillus colonization and invasive disease might be more challenging.

The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.","output":"How COVID-19 Has Globalized: Unknown Origin, Rapid Transmission, and the Immune System Nourishment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospitals.

Ambitious integrated and multifield research programs must be implemented in order to understand the causes and anticipate the consequences of loss of biodiversity. Such losses are a serious threat to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations. They have an influence on the natural balance of global biodiversity in particularly in reducing the capability of species to adapt rapidly by genetic mutations to survive in modified ecosystems. Usually, the natural immune systems of mammals (both human and animal), are highly polymorphic and able to adapt rapidly to new situations.

Rehabilitation Medicine has always played an essential role in the continuum of care, establishing functional goals while identifying patients for post-acute care planning. During this crisis, this expertise, and the overwhelming need to adapt and facilitate patient transitions, resulted in a collaborative process to efficiently assess patients for post-acute care needs. We worked closely with our skilled nursing facility, home care partners, and an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital to adapt their admissions processes to the COVID-19 patient population, all the while grappling with varying access to vital supplies, testing and manpower.

The pandemic has intensified the trend towards applications for electronic purchases and delivery services, to provide customers the facility of buying from anywhere and anytime, with great ease. However, there are some issues with these kind of purchases and delivery services. In particular, the data collected by these applications has the potential of having their security and privacy breached. Thus, trust of the service provider cannot be taken for granted. In fact, the service provider may prove to be a source of real danger to the privacy of users, especially if the service provider itself is a malicious party. Thus, it is difficult for the user to determine which applications can be trusted, and who to share their home or business location with. To solve this problem, in this research, we propose a new central platform that enables users to gather all of their (main) locations and control access to these locations in one place. Then the user can share them with other applications, such as link with hash-code included in a quick response (QR) barcode without the need to save their data in any application database. Moreover, the QR-code will be deactivated once it is used by the service provider, after the order is delivered. Therefore, the service provider will not be able to exploit the data stored in it, which means greater protection for the user's privacy. The system will offer other features for the user and the service provider as well. We have also implemented this system in a real manner to confirm its ability to improve the level of service in electronic purchase applications, in addition to improving the level of privacy of users' data. ? 2021 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can inactivate pathogens and viruses but more insight is needed into the performance of different UV wavelengths and their applications. We observed greater than a 3-log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity with a dose of 12.5 mJ/cm 2 of 254 nm UV light when the viruses were suspended in PBS, while a dose of 25 mJ/cm 2 was necessary to achieve a similar reduction when they were in an EMEM culture medium containing 2%(v/v) FBS, highlighting the critical effect of media in which the virus is suspended, given that SARS-CoV-2 is always aerosolized when airborne or deposited on a surface. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility (a measure of the effectiveness of the UV light) in a buffer such as PBS was 4.4-fold greater than that in a cell culture medium. Furthermore, we discovered the attenuation of UVC disinfection by amino acids, vitamins, and niacinamide, highlighting the importance of determining UVC dosages under a condition close to aerosols that wrap the viruses. We developed a disinfection model to determine the effect of the environment on UVC effectiveness with three different wavelengths, 222 nm, 254 nm, and 265 nm. An inverse correlation between the liquid absorbance and the viral susceptibility was observed. We found that 222 nm light was most effective at reducing viral infectivity in low absorbing liquids such as PBS, whereas 265 nm light was most effective in high absorbing liquids such as cell culture medium. Viral susceptibility was further decreased in N95 masks with 222 nm light being the most effective. The safety of 222 nm was also studied. We detected changes to the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum of human skins when the 222 nm accumulative exposure exceeded 50 J/cm 2 .The findings highlight the need to evaluate each UV for a given application, as well as limiting the dose to the lowest dose necessary to avoid unnecessary exposure to the public.","output":"Systematic Evaluating and Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 UVC Disinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The older adult population in Canada is increasing, and many will require care within an acute geriatric unit (AGU) or long-term care facility (LTCF).

Coifman, Michael J. Kane, Melissa Bishop, Lindsey M. Matt, K. Maria Nylocks and Pallavi Aurora (Emotion, Advanced Online Publication, Mar 18, 2019, np). In the article, in the Results and Discussion sections for Study 2 and in Table 6, it was stated that RSPAN scores predicted spontaneous down-regulation of negative affect from one diary signal to the next. However, because RSPAN scores are a person-level variable, it is an error to describe the results in that way. RSPAN scores cannot predict variability within person (i.e., signal to signal) but rather predict variability between person (i.e., person to person). Hence, a corrected interpretation would be to state that the RSPAN predicted levels of negative affect across the experience sampling diary, even when considering trait and state levels of affect and variability in daily stress. The analysis remains correct and the findings remain meaningful. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-14235-001.) We tested the association of 2 versions of the Reading Span Task of working memory capacity, a conventional neutral version (RSPAN-N) and an adapted task with incidental negative content (RSPAN-E), for predicting objective indicators (behavioral displays; autonomic activation) of negative emotion regulation during a laboratory provocation, as well as reported negative emotion in daily life experience sampling. Across 2 samples, both tasks demonstrated utility as estimates of spontaneous negative emotion regulation capacity, predicting down-regulation of negative emotion in daily life and during a lab challenge. In addition, scores from both tasks appear to be independent of self-reported distress, a confound often present in studies of emotion regulation. There was some incremental evidence that the RSPAN-E may have advantages over the RSPAN-N for predicting some indices of emotion processing. Together these findings provide further evidence for the role of working memory (among other executive-control abilities) in emotion regulatory processing and suggest that RSPAN tasks may have considerable potential as tools in research on emotion processing and emotion regulation in psychological health and adjustment.

For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was ?2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, ?7.0 to 2.2; P=0.35).

Having chronic kidney disease (CKD), together with related changes in diet and medication, may alter the gut microbiota and the microbial-derived uraemic metabolites that accumulate in kidney failure, and contribute to various complications including chronic diarrhoea, opportunistic infections, and drug-related colitis. Despite the high disease burden among patients with kidney replacement therapies, GI symptoms are often under-recognised and, consequently limited resources and strategies are devoted to the management of gastrointestinal complications in patients with CKD. METHODS: The CKD Bowel Health Study is a multi-centre mixed-methods observational longitudinal study to better understand the bowel health and GI symptom management in patients with CKD. The program comprises of a longitudinal study that will assess the burden and risk factors of GI intolerance in patients treated with maintenance dialysis; a semi-structured interview study that will describe experiences of GI intolerance (including symptoms, treatment, self-management) in transplant candidates and recipients; and a discrete choice experience to elicit patient preferences regarding their experiences and perspectives of various intervention strategies for the management of GI symptoms after kidney transplantation.

Qualitative economic and social impact analysis was used to identify the above types of effect on the food system on a macroscale, using Poland as an example. Information was sourced from existing data and qualitative studies. Studies show that the consequences of the pandemic for individual elements of the food system in Poland in 2020 were related to numerous disruptions in functioning, leading to uncertainty, financial losses, and interrupted transactions. The crisis under analysis also revealed modifications in these actorsbehaviours in food markets, noticeable in changes in consumption patterns and in the ways demand for food was met. Nevertheless, an analysis of the gathered information and data testifies to the food systems relative resistance to the effects of the pandemic, and also to the adaptive skills of the systems entities, especially food producers and consumers.

The H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A virus cause most of the seasonal epidemics observed in humans and are the major drivers of influenza A virus-associated mortality. The consequences of pandemic spread of COVID-19 underscore the public health importance of prospective vaccine development. Here, we show that headless hemagglutinin (HA) stabilized-stem immunogens presented on ferritin nanoparticles elicit broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses to diverse H1 and H3 viruses in nonhuman primates (NHPs) when delivered with a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AF03. The neutralization potency and breadth of antibodies isolated from NHPs were comparable to human bnAbs and extended to mismatched heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Although NHPs lack the immunoglobulin germline VH1-69 residues associated with the most prevalent human stem-directed bnAbs, other gene families compensated to generate bnAbs. Isolation and structural analyses of vaccine-induced bnAbs revealed extensive interaction with the fusion peptide on the HA stem, which is essential for viral entry. Antibodies elicited by these headless HA stabilized-stem vaccines neutralized diverse H1 and H3 influenza viruses and shared a mode of recognition analogous to human bnAbs, suggesting that these vaccines have the potential to confer broadly protective immunity against diverse viruses responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza infections in humans.","output":"Broad neutralization of H1 and H3 viruses by adjuvanted influenza HA stem vaccines in nonhuman primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To develop and test the cutting efficiency of a novel degradable glass as an alternative media to alumina powder for air abrasion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A zinc-based glass (QMZK2) was designed, produced, and evaluated with a multi-modality imaging analysis. The glass dissolution study was carried out in three acids, using ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy) at 5 different time points: 2.5, 5, 10, 60, and 240 min. The cutting efficiency of both materials was tested under the same parameters on slabs of elephant enamel. A stained fissure of a molar tooth was air abraded with the glass and evaluated with X-ray micro-tomography before and after air abrasion. RESULTS: The particle size distribution of the glass was similar to that of alumina 53 m but with a slightly greater dispersion of particle size. The shape of the particles was angular, appropriate for cutting purposes. The dissolution study showed that the glass dissolved rapidly in acidic conditions at all time points. Between the two variables, pressure and powder flow, pressure was found to influence the cutting speed to a greater extent than powder flow. CONCLUSIONS: Alumina powder was found to perform significantly better in 4 of the 9 conditions tested on elephant enamel, QMZK2 in one, and no significant differences were found for the rest of the 4 conditions. The QMZK2 seems to offer promising results as an alternative material to alumina.

In fact, improper splinting not only necessitates replacement, but splint-related soft tissue complications are the second most common iatrogenic cause for referral to plastic surgery. Improper splinting techniques include inadequate molding of plaster/fiberglass splints, inadequate padding over bony prominences, excessive compressive forces from elastic bandages applied too aggressively, and/or pressure areas created by applying padding and casting material in varying joint positions. While clinicians commonly pad bony prominences to minimize skin pressure, the effect of joint position on skin pressure and, more specifically, changing joint position, is understudied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate anterior ankle skin pressure secondary to joint position change during splinting. Methods: Following ethics approval by our institutional review board, various constructs of lower extremity, short-leg splints were applied to two healthy subjects (2 limbs total in this preliminary data set) with an underlying pressure transducer (Tekscan I- Scan system (Tekscan Inc, South Boston, MA, USA) on the skin surface centered on the anterior ankle on the tibialis anterior tendon. All subjects underwent anterior ankle surface pressure assessment when padding was applied in maximum plantar flexion and neutral position for conventional short leg splints application. Percent change from initial contact pressure centered on the tibialis anterior with either Webril (Covidien/Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland), or Specialist Cotton Blend Cast Padding (BSN Medical, Charlotte, NC, USA) were calculated. Neutral position of the foot/ankle will be confirmed with goniometer. Results: There were 2 limbs total that were analyzed for the presentation of pilot data for this study. The percent change in anterior ankle contact pressure when padding was applied in maximum plantarflexion (PF) and then placed in neutral was increased at least two-fold without the addition of plaster and subsequently with the addition of plaster in lower extremity short leg splints (Figure 1). Conclusion: In this pilot data, we report significant increases in anterior ankle contact pressures when splint padding is applied in plantar-flexion and re-positioned into neutral during splint application which may precipitate iatrogenic pressure ulcers in patients sustaining foot/ankle trauma. This data, though preliminary, underscores the importance in proper splinting techniques for all clinicians that manage lower extremity trauma (eg, orthopaedic surgery, emergency medicine, urgent care, etc).","output":"Anterior Ankle Skin Surface Pressures in Lower Extremity Splints: Minimizing Insult after Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is essential to consider challenges previously faced and addressed while developing a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively.

Kabuki syndrome type 1 (MIM# 147920) and Kabuki syndrome type 2 (MIM# 300867), can be associated with neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. PATIENT PRESENTATION: We report a female Italian (Sicilian) child, born preterm at 35 weeks gestation, with persistent hypoglycemia. Peculiar facial dysmorphisms, neonatal hypotonia, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia raised suspicion of Kabuki syndrome. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was confirmed with glucagon test and whole-exome sequencing (WES) found a novel heterozygous splicing-site mutation (c.674-1G > A) in KMT2D gene. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was successfully treated with diazoxide. At 3 months corrected age for prematurity, a mild global neurodevelopmental delay, postnatal weight and occipitofrontal circumference growth failure were reported.

In contrast, adults can have an overactive, dysregulated and less effective innate response that leads to uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokine production and tissue injury. More recent exposure to other viruses and routine vaccines in children might be associated with protective cross-reactive antibodies and T cells against SARS-CoV-2. There is less evidence to support other mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the age-related difference in outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including pre-existing immunity from exposure to common circulating coronaviruses, differences in the distribution and expression of the entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and difference in viral load.","output":"Why Does the Severity of COVID-19 Differ With Age?: Understanding the Mechanisms Underlying the Age Gradient in Outcome Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism has been increasingly recognized by its imaging and syndromic manifestations in the literature.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS After exposure to an index patient whose fatal illness was characterized by fever and hemorrhage at a primary care hospital and regional tertiary care hospital's isolation ward, secondary cases with febrile illness who were suspected of being exposed were tested for antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing for A. phagocytophilum DNA. Potential sources of exposure were investigated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cases with serological or PCR evidence of HGA were compared with uninfected contacts to define the attack rate, relative risk of illness, and potential risks for exposure during the provision of care to the index patient. RESULTS In a regional hospital of Anhui Province, China, between November 9 and 17, 2006, a cluster of 9 febrile patients with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels were diagnosed with HGA by PCR for A. phagocytophilum DNA in peripheral blood and by seroconversion to A. phagocytophilum. No patients had tick bites. All 9 patients had contact with the index patient within 12 hours of her death from suspected fatal HGA while she experienced extensive hemorrhage and underwent endotracheal intubation.

The present study aimed to describe the psychological impact of the crisis on our sample of young Swiss men and to examine differences due to their linguistic region, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and living arrangements.MethodBased on an ongoing cohort study, we assessed a general-population sample of young Swiss men (n = 2345;average 29 years old) shortly before (from April 2019) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (between 13 May and 8 June 2020). This was a unique opportunity to estimate the crisis psychological impact in form of depression, perceived stress and sleep quality (assessed before and during COVID-19), and any crisis-induced fears, isolation or psychological trauma. Associations of psychological impact with living arrangements, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and linguistic region (German-speaking vs French-speaking) were investigated using linear regression models. FindingsBy the time participants responded to our questionnaire, less than 1% had been tested positive for COVID-19, 2.6% had been tested negative, and 14.7% had had some COVID-19 symptoms but had not been tested. About 8.2% of the sample reported at least some symptoms of psychological trauma ( 24 points on the Impact of Event Scale). On average, participants reported higher levels of fear for others (43.6% at least moderate) and economical fear (12.7% at least moderate) than fear for themselves (5.8% at least moderate). Those living alone and those who reported having COVID-19 symptoms themselves, or knowing someone with symptoms, reported higher overall psychological impact in the form of depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation. Associations with linguistic region varied by outcome, with higher levels of depression and fear in French-speaking regions and higher levels of perceived stress and isolation in German-speaking regions. InterpretationThe crisis had a considerable impact on the psychological well-being of our sample of young Swiss men, and some groups were more affected than others: those living alone and those who had shown COVID-19 symptoms themselves;or had known someone with symptoms, may have felt a greater psychological impact from the crisis.

The best way to ensure the survival and safety of everyone involved in field-based learning is to adapt and integrate technology. In response to this problem, numerous innovations in learning technology that lead to the virtualization of the learning environment have begun to emerge. However, the various application products developed have fallen short of the expectations of students. As a result, in order to design the optimal virtual application for use in fieldbased learning, a needs analysis must be done. This study offers an understanding of student needs for virtual field-based learning applications. An online survey of 140 active university students was carried out to do so. The results showed that students require applications with sophisticated features that resemble the real world for the implementation of online field-based learning. They expect the incorporation of online meeting features, 360 Virtual Reality Panorama, access to learning videos, augmented reality, learning materials, chatbox, and multimedia into the software that will be developed. ? 2022.

OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%C23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

Data on respiratory viral infections in children with cancer are limited. METHODS A long-term, prospective, multicenter study was carried out in Finland searching for respiratory viruses in febrile children with leukemia. For this purpose, 138 febrile episodes in 51 children with leukemia were analyzed. Twelve types of respiratory viruses were searched for by viral culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS Evidence of a respiratory viral infection was found in 61 of 138 febrile episodes (44%), accounting for an incidence of 0.8 (range, 0-2.4) per person year at risk during the treatment of leukemia. The most common viruses detected were rhinovirus (22%), respiratory syncytial virus (11%), human bocavirus (5%), and influenza A virus (4%). Dual viral infections were detected in 12 cases (9%). Half of the children had respiratory symptoms with cough being the most common symptom. Two children developed pneumonia. The mean duration of fever was 2.6 (SD 1.7) days in children with respiratory viral infection and 2.1 (SD 1.3) days in children without evidence of viral infection (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses are found commonly during febrile episodes in children with leukemia. The detection of viruses permits the use of available antiviral agents, may explain a poor response to antimicrobial agents, and minimizes the proportion of febrile episodes without possible etiologic agents in children with leukemia.","output":"Respiratory viral infections in children with leukemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of May 14, 2020, Italy has been one of the red hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Evidence Integration Triangle (EIT)-4-BPSD in nursing homes was a pragmatic Hybrid III trial of an implementation strategy to help staff use evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions to prevent and manage BPSD. This study aimed to describe and explore the stakeholders perceptions of the process to implement the EIT-4-BPSD strategy including its utility, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation in real-world settings. METHODS: EIT-4-BPSD was a multi-layer implementation strategy that engaged nursing home stakeholder groups to define community specific goals towards reducing BPSD over a 12-month period. Stakeholder groups from nursing homes that completed all 12-months of the implementation strategy were invited to participate in this process evaluation study. Qualitative data from focus group transcripts were analyzed using a conventional content analysis. Emerging codes were sorted into categories, then organized in meaningful clusters based on the domains of the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. RESULTS: The EIT-4-BPSD implementation strategy was completed in 21 nursing homes; 93 stakeholders participated in focus groups. Over half of participating nursing homes reported meeting their BPSD goals as expected or more. Challenges, facilitators, and contextual factors reported by stakeholder members explains variability in the implementation of EIT-4-BPSD strategy in 11 key categories: family; staff; organizational; staff, environmental, and resident outcomes; utility of EIT resources; adoption barriers and facilitators; care process adaptations; and future planning. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders offered guidance on salient factors influencing the feasibility and utility of EIT-4-BPSD adoption and implementation to consider in future implementation research that aims to improve behavioral well-being in NH residents living with dementia. Engagement of family and staff at all levels of the organization (Management, leadership, and direct care); and measurement of staff, environmental, and resident outcomes were perceived as critical for future implementation success. While regulations, finances, and competing demands on staff time were perceived as reducing implementation success.

It often affects their close social relationships, and this is especially true when these individuals are no longer in close proximity to their family members and friends. Although face-to-face communication may be limited after relocation, computer-mediated communication can assist in maintaining and developing existing relationships. It may even help individuals initiate new social relationships. In the present study, we investigated the role of communication behavior with friends for perceived friendship quality among children and adolescents who recently experienced residential relocation. Based on a representative survey study of families in Germany, we selected parents having moved with their child (8 to 14 years) to another village or town within the last 24 months. In total, 57 parents who had recently moved C majority of whom were mothers C allowed their child to participate in the phone interview. These participants were, on average, 11 years of age, and 58% of them were male. The children answered questions about their communication behavior and the friendships they had with their three current best friends. Using multilevel analysis, we found that children and adolescents who more often communicated face-to-face with their friends also more intensively used computer-mediated technologies to stay in touch. However, the findings further revealed that computer-mediated communication has the potential to remove limitations in existing friendships in the event of relocation.

The potential of the plasmids to inhibit PDCoV replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, virus titers, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The cytopathogenicity assays demonstrated that pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N protected ST cells against pathological changes with high specificity and efficacy. The 50% tissue culture infective dose showed that the PDCoV titers in ST cells treated with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were reduced 13.2- and 32.4-fold, respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that the amount of viral RNA in cell cultures pre-transfected with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N was reduced by 45.8 and 56.1%, respectively.

Conversion of non-clinical space into medical units designated for Covid-19 patients became necessary to accommodate this mandate. METHODS: Non-clinical space was converted into medical units at multiple campuses of a large academic hospital system over 1 week. The conversion required construction to deliver basic care including oxygen supplementation. Creation of provider workspaces, handwashing areas, and colour-coded infection control zones was prioritized. Selection criteria were created with a workflow to determine appropriate patients for transfer into converted space. Staffing of converted space shifted as hospitalizations surged. RESULTS: The unit was open for 18 days and accommodated 170 unique patients. Five patients (2.9%) required transfer to a higher level of care. There were no respiratory arrests, cardiac arrests, or deaths in the new unit. CONCLUSION: Converting non-clinical space to a medical unit was accomplished quickly with staffing, workflow for appropriate patients, few patients who returned to a higher level of care, and no respiratory or cardiac arrests or deaths on the unit.","output":"Creation of a medical ward from non-clinical space amidst the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, contact clustering in social bubbles may allow extending contacts beyond the household at minimal additional risk and hence has been considered as part of modified lockdown policy or a gradual lockdown exit strategy. We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. Methods: ? We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate social bubble strategies (where two households form an exclusive pair) for households including children, for single occupancy households, and for all households. We test the sensitivity of results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. Results: Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case, social bubbles reduced fatalities by 42% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to above the epidemic threshold of R=1. Strategies allowing households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles increased the reproduction number by less than 11%. The corresponding increase in mortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is focussed in older adults irrespective of inclusion in social bubbles. Conclusions: ? If managed appropriately, social bubbles can be an effective way of extending contacts beyond the household while limiting the increase in epidemic risk.","output":"The effectiveness of social bubbles as part of a Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy, a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the CEO of a firm that helps organizations improve performance through culture and learning, and as someone who has spent the past 12 years coaching thousands of individual leaders, staff members, and physicians at hundreds of hospitals and health systems, I have seen both the positive effects of resilience and the negative effects of a lack of resilience.

These studies have often utilized definitions of myocardial injury that are not guideline-based and thus, not applicable to the U.S. patient population. METHODS: The current study is a two-part investigation of the effect of myocardial injury on the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The first part is a retrospective analysis of 268 patients admitted to our healthcare system in Toledo, Ohio, U.S.; the second part is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all similar studies performed within the U.S. RESULTS: In our retrospective analysis, patients with myocardial injury were older (mean age 73 vs. 59 years, P 0.001), more likely to have hypertension (86% vs. 67%, P 0.005), underlying cardiovascular disease (57% vs. 24%, P 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (26% vs. 10%, P 0.004). Myocardial injury was also associated with a lower likelihood of discharge to home (35% vs. 69%, P 0.001), and a higher likelihood of death (33% vs. 10%, P 0.001), acute kidney injury (74% vs. 30%, P 0.001), and circulatory shock (33% vs. 12%, P 0.001).

The causes of necrozoospermia are multiple: they can be related to testicular and/or post-testicular damage. Additionally, these causes most often involve the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) which can reduce the chances of spontaneous pregnancy or affect the outcome of assisted reproductive technologies. OBJECTIVE To focus on potential etiologies of necrozoospermia, its diagnosis and its therapeutic management especially before the employment of ICSI. METHODS Authors searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google and Institutional websites for medical subheading terms and free text words referred to \\"necrozoospermia\\", \\"sperm vitality\\", \\"sperm viability\\", \\"sperm DNA fragmentation\\" and \\"ICSI\\". RESULTS We identified twelve main etiologies of necrozoospermia responsible for either a decrease of sperm vitality, a mild a moderate or a severe necrozoospermia. In case of a confirmed decreased vitality, a thorough check-up should be conducted and if available, etiological treatment should be proposed. Therapeutic management could also include repeated ejaculations, drug treatments, the use of ICSI with ejaculated or surgically extracted spermatozoa in case of a non-treatable necrozoospermia. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The potential causes of necrozoospermia should be investigated because many of them could be corrected, thus avoiding the use of ICSI.

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on patients affected by COVID-19 who were admitted at our center. Our study included patients with no, mild, and moderate symptoms (nonsevere cases). Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients were excluded considering the difficulty in procuring the fundus image by the handheld camera due to patients positioning. Patients with systemic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and severe anemia) known to cause retinopathy were also excluded. Bedside anterior segment examination, fundus examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus imaging of each patient using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera was done by a trained ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: In a cohort of 138 patients, 94 (68.1%) were men and 44 (31.9%) were women. A total of 276 eyes were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 38.51  14.4 years.

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH2-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2'-OH at the 3'-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2'-OH, have a blocked 2'-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.","output":"A library of nucleotide analogues terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by polymerases of coronaviruses that cause SARS and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The presence of many asymptomatic COVID-19 cases may increase the risks of disease dissemination, mainly for physicians.

METHODS: We developed a 15-item online questionnaire on Sudden Olfactory Loss (SOL) and COVID-19 that was administered during March 2020 to Italian general practitioners registered to a social media group. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty responses were received. SOL was identified as a significant sign of infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly aged between 30 and 40 years, even in the absence of other symptoms. SOL was present as an initial symptom in 46.7% of subjects, and in 16.7%, it was the only symptom. Among the COVID-19 confirmed cases, SOL occurred as the only symptom in 19.2% of patients.

The main objective is to analyze OHCA survival in the Lombardy region by highlighting the factors related to both the victims characteristics and the chain of survival. METHODS: All OHCAs were grouped into four pre-established periods in 2019 (14-23 January; 15-24 April; 15-24 July; 14-23 October). Following the Utstein method, we selected witnessed OHCAs with presumed cardiac etiology. The outcome of each case was collected in four moments in time: Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), Emergency Department (ED), 24 hours and 30 days. The neurological outcome 30 days after OHCA was also investigated and stratified with the Cerebral Performance Category Score (CPC). RESULTS: We selected 456 cases of OHCA with witnessed cardiac etiology. ROSC was achieved in 121 cases (26.5%), survival in the Emergency Departments in 110 patients (24.1%), after 24 hours in 86 (18.86%) and after 30 days in 72 (15.8%).

Only about 30% of the fresh water total is available on earth, in groundwater and surface water, for drinking and other daily human activities as well as industrial and agricultural activities. Further, 20% of the available fresh water is not available to humans living in remote areas, 60% of fresh water cannot be captured, as it comes at inconvenient times and places (e.g., monsoons and floods), and 18% of fresh water is contaminated by human activities. Only about 2% of fresh water is available for usage. Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities.

The pandemic situation may make difficult to prioritize patients with allergies diseases (AD), face-to-face evaluation, and moreover concern about the possible COVID-19 diagnosis, since COVID-19 shared many symptoms in common with AD. Being COVID-19 a novel disease, everyone is susceptible; there are some advances on vaccine and specific treatment. We evaluate existing literature on allergic diseases (AD): allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, drug allergy, and skin allergy, and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between AD and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between AD and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19. AD patients should minimize hospital and face-to-face visits, and those who have used biologics and allergen immunotherapy should continue the treatment. It is essential to wear personal protective equipment for the protection of health care workers.

A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology C Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head & neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure. CONCLUSION: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible. Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy.

Randomised controlled trials have recently shown that there are no meaningful benefits of these two therapies in hospitalised patients. Uncertainty remains regarding the potential harmful impact of these therapies as very early treatments and their burden to the health care system. The present study investigated the length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality, and costs of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or their combination in comparison with standard of care among patients hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS This retrospective observational cohort study took place in the Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland (n = 840) between 26 February and 31 May 2020. Demographics, treatment regimens, comorbidities, the modified National Early Warning Score (mNEWS) on admission, and contraindications to COVID-19 treatment options were assessed. Outcomes included LOS, in-hospital mortality, and drug and LOS costs. RESULTS After successful propensity score matching, patients treated with (1) hydroxychloroquine, (2) lopinavir/ritonavir or (3) their combination had on average 3.75 additional hospitalisation days (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37C6.12, p = 0.002), 1.23 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI ?1.24 C 3.51, p = 0.319), and 4.19 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI 1.52C5.31, p <0.001), respectively, compared with patients treated with the standard of care. Neither experimental therapy was significantly associated with mortality. These additional hospital days amounted to 1010.77 additional days for hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine combined with lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in an additional cost of US$ 2,492,214 (95%CI US$ 916,839C3,450,619).

RESULTS: The study included 488 patients (median age 68 years). At presentation, 24.6% of patients were hyponatremic, mainly due to hypovolemia, and 5.3% hypernatremic. Hypernatremia two days after admission and exposure to hypernatremia at any timepoint during hospitalization were associated with a 2.34-fold (95% CI 1.08 - 5.05, p=0.0014) and 3.05-fold (95% CI 1.69 - 5.49, p<0.0001), respectively, increased risk of death compared to normonatremia.

Recent evidence indicates that even though most pregnant have a mild or asymptomatic course, a severe course of COVID-19 and a higher risk of progression to diseases have also been described, along with a heightened risk for pregnancy complications. Yet, vertical transmission of the virus is rare and the possibility of placental SARS-CoV-2 infection as a prerequisite for vertical transmission requires further studies. We here assessed the severity of COVID-19 and onset of neonatal infections in an observational study of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Our placental analyses showed a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 viral expression ex vivo in term placentae under acute infection. No viral placental expression was detectable in convalescent pregnant women. Inoculation of placental explants generated from placentas of non-infected women at birth with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro revealed inefficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in different types of placental tissues, which provides a rationale for the low ex vivo viral expression. We further detected specific SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in pregnant women within a few days upon infection, which was undetectable in cord blood. Our present findings confirm that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare, likely due to the inefficient virus replication in placental tissues. Despite the predominantly benign course of infection in most mothers and negligible risk of vertical transmission, continuous vigilance on the consequences of COVID-19 during pregnancy is required, since the maternal immune activation in response to the SARS-CoV2 infection may have long-term consequences for childrens health.","output":"Inefficient Placental Virus Replication and Absence of Neonatal Cell-Specific Immunity Upon Sars-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients who were incidentally diagnosed with Covid-19 in the postoperative period. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed 826 open cardiac surgeries in five tertiary centers. Most of the surgeries were elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (93.8%). A preoperative RT-PCR test and transcutaneous oxygen saturation were routinely investigated prior to surgery. We also investigated whether the patients already received Covid-19 treatment or had any contact with a Covid-19 patient in the last two weeks. We analyzed high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), d-dimer, and fibrinogen, which plays a main role in the activation of procoagulant state after surgeries. RESULTS Acute lung injury related to Covid-19 activation was observed in 48 out of 826 patients (5.8%). The median age of 48 patients was 63.912.4 years. Euro-Score and body mass index (BMI) were 6.11.1 and 29.24.1kg/m2, respectively. RT-PCR test results were positive in 29 patients (60.4%). We performed thoracic computed tomography (CT) in all patients with or without positive RT-PCR test results. Thoracic CT images showed that there was a different degree of ARDS (mild, moderate, and serious). The median time of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was 93.214.6 min. in on-pump surgery (IQR, 68-155 min.). Common symptoms included dyspnea (N = 22; 45.8%) and fever (N = 12; 25%). Eleven patients needed readmission to ICU. Compared with non-admitted to ICU patients, ICU patients were higher comorbidities and severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, high blood d-dimer and fibrinogen). We also detected significantly low oxygen saturation, hypercapnia, and severe acidosis in readmitted patients. Radiologic investigations showed that there were severe ARDS with bilateral pneumonic infiltration resistant to medical treatment in 6 out of 11 patients who died (54.5%). CONCLUSION Diffuse pneumonic infiltration related to Covid-19 may develop in asymptomatic cardiac surgery patients with negative RT-PCR test results. Immunologic disorders resulting from ECC, physiologic distress, and anesthesia may activate Covid-19 during the incubation period. We need randomized clinical trials to explain Covid-19 activation in the latent period of the virus, and clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery.","output":"The Outcomes of Patients Incidentally Confirmed with Covid-19 After Cardiac Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macrophages (M) are central players in mediating proinflammatory and immunomodulatory functions.

While the biobanking community is in general committed to such principles, little is known about precisely which governance strategies biobanks adopt to meet those objectives. We conducted an exploratory analysis of governance mechanisms adopted by research biobanks, including genetic biobanks, located in Europe and Canada. We reviewed information available on the websites of 69 biobanks, and directly contacted them for additional information. Our study identified six types of commonly adopted governance strategies: communication, compliance, expert advice, external review, internal procedures, and partnerships. Each strategy is implemented through different mechanisms including, independent ethics assessment, informed consent processes, quality management, data access control, legal compliance, standard operating procedures and external certification. Such mechanisms rely on a wide range of bodies, committees and actors from both within and outside the biobanks themselves. We found that most biobanks aim to be transparent about their governance mechanisms, but could do more to provide more complete and detailed information about them. In particular, the retrievable information, while showing efforts to ensure biobanks operate in a legitimate way, does not specify in sufficient detail how governance mechanisms support accountability, nor how they ensure oversight of research operations. This state of affairs can potentially undermine biobanks trustworthiness to stakeholders and the public in a long-term perspective.

Here, in an attempt to design an efficient vaccine, a thorough immunoinformatics approach was followed to predict the most suitable viral proteins epitopes for building that vaccine. METHODS: The amino acid sequences of four structural proteins (S, M, N, E) along with one potentially antigenic accessory protein (ORF1a) of SARS-CoV-2 were inspected for the most appropriate epitopes to be used for building the vaccine construct. Several immunoinformatics tools were used to assess the antigenicity (VaxiJen server), immunogenicity (IEDB immunogenicity tool), allergenicity (AlgPred), toxigenicity (ToxinPred server), interferon-gamma inducing capacity (IFNepitope server), and the physicochemical properties of the construct (ProtParam tool). RESULTS: The final candidate vaccine construct consisted of 468 amino acids, encompassing 29 epitopes. The CTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and immunogenicity assessment were four epitopes from S protein, one from M protein, two from N protein, 12 from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from E protein. While the HTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and INF-[Formula: see text] were one from S protein, three from M protein, six from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from N and E proteins. All the vaccine properties and its ability to trigger the humoral and cell-mediated immune response were validated computationally. Molecular modeling, docking to TLR3, simulation, and molecular dynamics were also carried out. Finally, a molecular clone using pET28::mAID expression plasmid vector was prepared. CONCLUSION: The overall results of the study suggest that the final multi-epitope chimeric construct is a potential candidate for an efficient protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Immunoinformatics approach for multi-epitope vaccine design against structural proteins and ORF1a polyprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to examine the e-libraries, digital libraries, electronic libraries, and online libraries employing bibliometric study techniques from 1971 to 2020.

Due to the low sensitivity of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging is being used for COVID-19 diagnostic correlation and to evaluate whether there is pneumonic involvement in the lung. Objective In this study, we aimed to compare whether there was a difference in terms of QT interval prolongation and effect on heart rate in COVID-19 patients based on their chest CT findings and drug treatment regimes. Methods This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients hospitalized . A total of 344 patients with a mean age of 46.34  17.68 years were included in the study (56.1% men). Patients were divided into four groups according to their chest CT results as having typical, atypical, indeterminate, or no finding of pneumonic involvement. Mean QTc intervals and heart rates calculated from electrocardiograms at admission and after treatment were compared. Results There were no significant differences between groups with regards to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). There were also no significant differences between the groups in terms of mean QTc interval values upon admission (p:0.127) or after treatment (p:0.205).

Our meta-analysis investigated the prevalence and possible factors associated with adverse events (AEs) during IHT. METHODS Searching PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases until February 12, 2021, we included studies that a priori defined AEs for adult medical patients. We excluded case reports, non-full-text, and non-English language studies. We performed a random effects meta-analysis and moderator analyses. RESULTS We identified 554 studies and included 19 studies (14,969 patients) in our final analysis. The mean patients' (standard deviation) age was 60 (13.7). The pooled medical AEs for IHT was 1,059 (11%, 95% confidence interval, 7.5%-16%). The most common AE (n, %) was hypotension (424, 2.8%). Moderator analyses and meta-regressions suggested that conditions (P < .001) such as respiratory failure from coronavirus infection (88%), stroke (19%), and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (40%) were associated with higher AE prevalence. Transport by nurses (31%) and physicians (11%) was associated with a higher AE prevalence, whereas transport type did not influence AE prevalence. CONCLUSION Our study suggests the prevalence of AEs of critically ill patients during IHT is low and likely due to patients' disease severity.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is one of the countries where relatively strict lockdown measures were enforced. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the lockdown circumstances in Jordan on antenatal care services and health circumstances of pregnant women during this period. Participants and Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional survey of Jordanian women who are currently pregnant. An electronic survey was distributed among pregnant women in Jordan. A total of 944 completed responses were returned and analyzed. The sample size was statistically determined to be representative of the population. Results: The results revealed a significant increase in the percentage of pregnant women not receiving antenatal care from 4% to 59.53% (p<0.001) during the lockdown period, despite the fact that some of these women were suffering from significant underlying medical conditions or serious pregnancy complications that require close antenatal surveillance. The survey also demonstrated that the lockdown circumstances impacted the physical, social, and mental wellbeing of the participants. Conclusion: Although the lockdown measures in Jordan have succeeded so far in relative containment of COVID-19, this research suggests that significant disruption to antenatal services has occurred and that the lockdown has affected the wellbeing of pregnant women in a number of aspects, which has the potential to cause antenatal health issues that are not directly related to the spread of COVID-19, but rather are a side effect of the way in which the outbreak is managed.","output":"Pregnancy During COVID-19 Outbreak: The Impact of Lockdown in a Middle-Income Country on Antenatal Healthcare and Wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On April 12, 2020, a bioethics guide for allocating scarce hospital resources during the current Covid-19 pandemic was posted on the website of the Consejo de Salubridad General(CSG) of the Government of Mexico.

These hamper their potential societal benefit and impairs the ability to quickly respond to emerging new pathogens. This is especially worrisome since new pathogens are emerging at all-time high rates of over one per year, and many age-old pathogens are still not vaccine preventable.Through interviews with 20 key-opinion-leaders (KOLs), this study identified innovation barriers that increase vaccine development timelines. These innovation barriers were visualized, and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. Based on a survey the innovation barriers were quantitatively ranked based on their relative impact on both regular, and Covid-19 vaccine development timelines. KOLs identified 20 key innovation barriers, and mapping these barriers onto the Vaccine Innovation Cycle model revealed that all phases of vaccine development were affected. Affected by most barriers is the area between the preclinical studies and the market entry. Difficult hand-off between academia and industry, lack of funding, and lack of knowledge of pathogen targets were often mentioned as causes. Quantitative survey responses from 93 KOLs showed that general vaccine development and Covid-19 vaccine development are impacted by distinct sets of innovation barriers. For the general vaccine development three barriers were perceived of the highest impact; limited ROI for vaccines addressing disease with limited market size, limited ROI for vaccines compared to non-vaccine projects, and academia not being able to progress beyond proof of principle. Of highest impact on Covid-19 vaccine development, are lack of knowledge concerning pathogen target, high risk of upscaling unlicensed vaccines, and proof of principle not meeting late-stage requirements. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that barriers hampering timelines in vaccine development are present across the Vaccine Innovation Cycle. Prioritizing the impact of barriers in general, and in Covid-19 vaccine development, shows clear differences that can be used to inform policies to speed up development in both war and peace time.","output":"Barriers Influencing Vaccine Development Timelines, Identification, Causal Analysis, and Prioritization of Key Barriers by KOLs in General and Covid-19 Vaccine R&D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Viruses have been implicated in the initiation, progression, and exacerbation of several human autoimmune diseases.

At the end of 2020, the partnered OPS moved to a new location, which created a gap in service for SPH inpatients and outpatients. To address this gap, which was magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, SPH opened a nurse-led OPS in February 2021. This paper describes the steps leading to the implementation of the nurse-led OPS, its impact, and lessons learned. METHODS: Four steps paved the way for the opening of the OPS: (1) identifying the problem, (2) seeking ethics guidance, (3) adapting policies and practices, and (4) supporting and training staff. RESULTS: The OPS is open between 10:00 and 20:00 and staffed by two nurses per shift. It is accessible to all patients including inpatients, patients in the Emergency Department, and patients attending outpatient services.

The underlying innate immune mechanisms, which represent the first line of defense against pathogens, remain incompletely understood. Drosophila melanogaster is able to mount potent and evolutionarily conserved innate immune defenses against a variety of microorganisms including viruses and serves as an excellent model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions. With its relatively short lifespan, Drosophila also is an organism of choice for aging studies. Despite numerous advantages that this model offers, Drosophila has not been used to its potential to investigate the response of the aged host to viral infection. Here we show that in comparison to younger flies, aged Drosophila succumb more rapidly to infection with the RNA-containing Flock House Virus (FHV) due to an age-dependent defect in disease tolerance. In comparison to younger individuals, we find that older Drosophila mount larger transcriptional responses characterized by differential regulation of more genes and genes regulated to a greater extent. Our results indicate that loss of disease tolerance to FHV with age possibly results from a stronger regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, activation of the Drosophila Immune deficiency (IMD) NF-kB pathway or from downregulation of genes whose products function in mitochondria and mitochondrial respiration. Our work shows that Drosophila can serve as a model to investigate host-virus interactions during aging and sets the stage for future analysis of the age-dependent mechanisms that govern survival and control of virus infections at older age.","output":"Age-dependent impairment of disease tolerance is associated with a robust transcriptional response following RNA virus infection in Drosophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are central building blocks in the intracellular signaling network, are often manipulated by viruses of diverse families to favor their replication. Among the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is known to be modulated during the infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); however, involvement of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) comprising p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether activation of p38 MAPK and JNK cascades is required for PEDV replication. Our results showed that PEDV activates p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 up to 24 h post-infection, whereas, thereafter their phosphorylation levels recede to baseline levels or even fall below them. Notably, UV-irradiated inactivated PEDV, which can enter cells but cannot replicate inside them, failed to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 suggesting that viral biosynthesis is essential for activation of these kinases. Treatment of cells with selective p38 or JNK inhibitors markedly impaired PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner and these antiviral effects were found to be maximal during the early times of the infection. Furthermore, direct pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK1/2 activation resulted in a significant reduction of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny release. However, independent treatments with either SAPK inhibitor did not inhibit PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death mediated by activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) suggesting that SAPKs are irrelevant to the apoptosis pathway during PEDV infection.

Generally, there is a low rate of bonafide co-infections in early COVID-19 pulmonary infection as currently appreciated. Reports of high co-infection rates must be tempered by limitations in current diagnostic methods since amplification technologies do not necessarily confirm live pathogen and may be subject to considerable laboratory variation. Some laboratory methods may not exclude commensal microbes. Concurrent serodiagnoses have long been of concern for accuracy in these contexts. Presumed virus co-infections are not specific to COVID-19. The association of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in co-infection has been considerably variable during influenza season. Other respiratory virus co-infections have generally occurred in less than 10% of COVID-19 patients. Early COVID-19 disease is more commonly associated with bacterial co-pathogens that typically represent usual respiratory micro-organisms. Late infections, especially among severe clinical presentations, are more likely to be associated with nosocomial or opportunistic pathogens given the influence of treatments that can include antibiotics, antivirals, immunomodulating agents, blood products, immunotherapy, steroids, and invasive procedures. As anticipated, hospital care carries risk for multi-resistant bacteria. Overall, co-pathogen identification is linked with longer hospital stay, greater patient complexity, and adverse outcomes. As for other viral infections, a general reduction in the use of empiric antibiotic treatment is warranted. Further insight into co-infections with COVID-19 will contribute overall to effective antimicrobial therapies and disease control.","output":"The Complexity of Co-Infections in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk, and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to combat the disease. RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.","output":"Evidence for host-dependent RNA editing in the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) offer patient isolation and medical support for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients with coron","output":"Clinical Course of Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19: Early Clinical Features of Patients Admitted to a Living and Treatment Support Center in Jecheon, South Korea (Part II)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cell receptor (TCR) antigenCspecific recognition is essential for the adaptive immune system.

Recent publications suggest a benefit of the Ross procedure over conventional AVR and highlight the need for high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCTs) on the optimal AVR. We have initiated a pilot trial assess two feasibility criteria and one assumption: (1) evaluate the capacity to enrol six patients per centre per year in at least five international centre, (2) validate greater than 90% compliance with allocation and (3) to validate the proportion of mechanical (65%) vs biological (35%) valves in the conventional arm. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Ross for Valve replacement In AduLts (REVIVAL) is a multinational, expertise-based RCT in adults aged 18-60 years undergoing AVR, comparing the Ross procedure versus one of the alternative approaches (mechanical vs stented or stentless bioprosthesis). The feasibility objectives will be assessed after randomising 60 patients; we will then make a decision regarding whether to expand the trial with the current protocol. We will ultimately examine the impact of the Ross procedure as compared with conventional AVR in non-elderly adults on survival free of valve-related life-threatening complications (major bleeding, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis and valve reoperation) over the duration of follow-up. The objectives of the pilot trial will be analysed using descriptive statistics. In the full trial, the intention-to-treat principle will guide all primary analyses. A time-to-event analysis will be performed and Kaplan-Meier survival curves with comparison between groups using a log rank test will be presented.

We consider various models for the organization of link and triangle structures and different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and healing. We find that explosive transitions can be suppressed by heterogeneity in the link degree distribution when links and triangles are chosen independently or when link and triangle connections are positively correlated when compared to the uncorrelated case.

DESIGN: Representative cross-sectional telephone survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1207 randomly drawn adults of the city of Hamburg, Germany, between November 2020 and January 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES: Different vignettes with severe symptoms were presented varying in sex, age (child, middle-aged person, older person), daytime (Tuesday morning or Tuesday evening) and disease (COVID-19 or IGD), while the degree of urgency was equivalent for all cases. The respondents were asked for the intended healthcare utilisation resulting in three different alternatives: general practitioner (GP)/paediatrician, medical on-call service (116117) and emergency care (accident and emergency department, emergency practice, rescue service). In multivariate analyses, associations of characteristics of the vignettes and participants (sex, age, education, migration background) with intended healthcare utilisation were tested. In a further step, analyses were conducted separately for IGD and COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the vignettes characteristics, intended utilisation of GP/paediatrician is associated with female sex, higher age, daytime (morning) and COVID-19 symptoms, the medical on-call service with male sex, daytime (evening) and COVID-19 symptoms and the emergency medicine with younger age, daytime (evening) and IGD. Women chose more often the GP/paediatrician, men preferred emergency medicine. Only in case of IGD, higher educated persons more often chose the medical on-call service while people with a migration background decided less often for medical on-call service and emergency medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Despite comparable urgency, the findings suggest variations of intended healthcare utilisation depending on various characteristics of the vignettes and respondents.

In this work, two model based strategies are presented, aiming to control and improve the resin lifetime. The first approach, purely statistical, enables qualitative monitoring of the column state and prediction of column performance indicators (e.g. yield, purity and dynamic binding capacity) from chromatographic on-line data (e.g. UV signal). The second one, referred to as hybrid modeling, is based on a lumped kinetic model, which includes two aging parameters fitted on several resin cycling experimental campaigns with varying cleaning procedures (CP). The first aging parameter accounts for binding capacity deterioration (caused by ligand degradation, leaching, and pore occlusion), while the second accounts for a decreased mass transfer rate (mainly caused by fouling). The hybrid model provides important insights into the prevailing aging mechanism as a function of the different CPs. In addition, it can be applied to model based CP optimization and yield forecasting with the capability of state estimation corrections based on on-line process information.

However, the direct specific effect of QS molecules on host biology is largely understudied. In this work, we show that the QS molecule DSF (cis-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid) produced by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana, mediated by flagellin-induced activation of flagellin receptor FLS2. The DSF-mediated attenuation of innate immunity results from the alteration of FLS2 nanoclusters and endocytic internalization of plasma membrane FLS2. DSF altered the lipid profile of Arabidopsis, with a particular increase in the phytosterol species, which impairs the general endocytosis pathway mediated by clathrin and FLS2 nano-clustering on the plasma membrane. The DSF effect on receptor dynamics and host immune responses could be entirely reversed by sterol removal. Together, our results highlighted the importance of sterol homeostasis to plasma membrane organization and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria use their communicating molecule to manipulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered host immunity.","output":"The bacterial quorum sensing signal DSF hijacks Arabidopsis thaliana sterol biosynthesis to suppress plant innate immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) constitutes a major health problem and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Patients with CKD have impaired immune functions that predispose them to an increased risk of infections, as well as virus-associated cancers and a diminished vaccine response.

There were 37 patients with CKD, mean age 58.3  14.1 years, admitted to BHN due to COVID-19, and among them, 24 (65.7%) were males (p = 0.016). During hospitalization, 23 patients with CKD (62.1%) died of complications associated with COVID-19 disease, which was a higher proportion (odds ratio (OR) 5.6, confidence interval (CI) 2.1-15.7, p = 0.001) compared to a group of 70 patients (64.8% males, mean age 57.5  13.7 years) without CKD admitted during the same period in whom 28.5% died of COVID-19. In the entire cohort, the majority of patients presented with bilateral pneumonia, and the most common symptoms at admission were dyspnea, cough, and fever. Serum levels of D-dimer, ferritin and procalcitonin were significantly higher in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD. Multivariate analysis revealed that CKD, age (>60 years), and hypoxia measured in the ER were factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Among patients with CKD but not in those without CKD (OR 36.8, CI 1.5-88.3, p = 0.026), an increased monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was associated with higher mortality and remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. The MLR measured in the ER may be useful for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with CKD and COVID-19 and could contribute to early risk stratification in this group.","output":"Elevated Monocyte to Lymphocyte Ratio and Increased Mortality among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Hospitalized for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Patients with devastated bulbar urethras have limited surgical options to restore normal upright voiding. We investigated the long-term feasibility of using two independently vascularized urethral hemi-plates lined with buccal mucosal graft (BMG) to treat these patients. METHODS A multi-institutional retrospective review was conducted for patients that underwent this staged repair. In stage-1, the affected urethra is dissected and removed or prepared for a dorsal inlay augmentation. Two BMG segments are harvested; one graft is quilted on corpora cavernosa and urethra, creating an augmented perineal urethrostomy, and the other is quilted on the exposed distal gracilis muscle. Stage-2 utilizes the gracilis-BMG composite to recreate ventral bulbar urethra. The primary outcome measure was stricture recurrence. Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). RESULTS Five patients with mean age of 50 years (45-56) underwent staged repairs at two institutions between 7/2014 and 4/2016. All patients presented with suprapubic tubes and underwent at least one prior failed repair (1-9). Mean stricture length was 7.2 cm (5-9). Mean time between stage-1 and stage-2 repairs was 6.2 weeks (1-10). At a mean follow-up of 61 months (39-87), there were no recurrences. The mean uroflow was 20 cc/s (9-42) with a mean PVR of 59 cc (0-157). Four patients completed post-operative surveys; all reported at least a moderate improvement in their condition on Global Response Assessment (GRA), and a mean IPSS of 7.3 (0-26).

However, clinical studies are conflicting, possibly due to use of non-specific outcomes reflecting a mix of large and small airway LRTI lacking specificity for acute lung or organ injury. METHODS: We developed a global ordinal scale to differentiate large and small airway LRTI in hospitalized adults with influenza using physiologic features and interventions (PFIs): vital signs, laboratory and radiographic findings, and clinical interventions. We reviewed the literature to identify common PFIs across 9 existing scales of pneumonia and sepsis severity. To characterize patients using this scale, we applied the scale to an antiviral clinical trial dataset where these PFIs were measured through routine clinical care in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated LRTI during the 2010C2013 seasons. RESULTS: We evaluated 12 clinical parameters among 1020 adults; 210 (21%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza, with a median severity score of 4.5 (interquartile range, 2C8). Among influenza cases, median age was 63 years, 20% were hospitalized in the prior 90 days, 50% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 22% had congestive heart failure. Primary influencers of higher score included pulmonary infiltrates on imaging (48.1%), heart rate 110 beats/minute (41.4%), oxygen saturation <93% (47.6%) and respiratory rate >24 breaths/minute (21.0%). Key PFIs distinguishing patients with severity < or 8 (upper quartile) included infiltrates (27.1% vs 90.0%), temperature  39.1C or <36.0C (7.1% vs 27.1%), respiratory rate >24 breaths/minute (7.9% vs 47.1%), heart rate 110 beats/minute (29.3% vs 65.7%), oxygen saturation <90% (14.3% vs 31.4%), white blood cell count >15,000 (5.0% vs 27.2%), and need for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (2.1% vs 15.7%).

There is an ever-increasing plethora of physiological and pathophysiological conditions attributed to p38 activity, ranging from cell division and embryonic development to the control of a multitude of diseases including retinal, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the decades of intense investigation, a viable therapeutic approach to disrupt p38 signaling remains elusive. A growing body of evidence supports the pathological significance of an understudied atypical p38 signaling pathway. Atypical p38 signaling is driven by a direct interaction between the adaptor protein TAB1 and p38, driving p38 autophosphorylation independent from the classical MKK3 and MKK6 pathways. Unlike the classical MKK3/6 signaling pathway, atypical signaling is selective for just p38, and at present has only been characterized during pathophysiological stimulation. Recent studies have linked atypical signaling to dermal and vascular inflammation, myocardial ischemia, cancer metastasis, diabetes, complications during pregnancy, and bacterial and viral infections. Additional studies are required to fully understand how, when, where, and why atypical p38 signaling is induced.

Vaccine hesitancy, identified as a top threat to global health by the World Health Organization, is a significant barrier to vaccine uptake. With COVID-19 vaccination programs in effect since December 2020, it is critical that vaccination barriers are proactively identified. With limited information surrounding college students' perspectives on COVID-19 vaccines, outreach measures will play a pivotal role in vaccine uptake in this population. Development of informative, cohort-driven vaccination campaigns requires proactive assessment of factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, access, and uptake. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy among college students at the University of Rhode Island (URI). The secondary objective was to identify differences in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy rates in this population. METHODS: A 22-item, Institutional Review Board-approved, anonymous questionnaire was developed to survey URI students who voluntarily attended 2 joint University Health Services and College of Pharmacy influenza vaccination clinics in November 2020. RESULTS: A total of 237 vaccination clinic participants consented and responded to at least 1 question on the survey. Once available to their respective priority group, 92% are very/somewhat likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 50% will receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Only 3% of the participants stated that they would never receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The top 3 reported COVID-19 vaccine-related concerns were safety (37%), effectiveness (24%), and limited information (16%). When asked if COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines should be mandated, 85% and 83%, respectively, were in favor. CONCLUSION: Understanding the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy is critical in achieving COVID-19 community immunity thresholds.

The socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures. In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission. However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individual-level data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections. We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections. Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold. We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over one-third of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population. Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, in order to safely lift current restrictions and minimize the risk of resurgence.","output":"The implications of silent transmission for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between health literacy (HL) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity. METHODS: Pulmonary function test, sociodemographic features, Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, COPD assessment test (CAT), and the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire were used. The study examined 13,760 patients who underwent a pulmonary function test. Out of 13,760 patients, 673 patients had FEV1/FVC values less than 70%. Those with FEV1/FVC< 0.70 (n = 336) after the reversibility test were included in the study. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in HL and an increase in COPD severity (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the risk of severe COPD was 2.74 times higher in patients in the poor income level than in patients in the good income level. In patients with inadequate HL, the risk of developing severe COPD was 1.80 times higher. A significant difference was found in HL index scores among the groups in terms of education level and income level (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively). The most difficult topics for patients with COPD were periodic health examinations, good practices in mental health, and adult vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD were found to be at a HL level well below the expected level. The risk of severe COPD increased with poor income and inadequate HL. Healthcare providers should be careful in accessing, understanding, and interpreting the health information of patients with inadequate HL. Therefore, patient education should be prioritized in the follow-up and in the treatment of patients with COPD. Physicians should pay maximum attention to patients with COPD in the regular use of drugs, their proper use, in taking preventive measures, and in adult vaccination.","output":"Health Literacy and Health Outcomes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients: An Explorative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic has posed substantial impacts on individual's daily routine and psychological state.

During the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic there has been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behavior. Under such circumstances policymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health services might be 'overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration yet formal modelling of optimal policy has so far largely ignored this. Here we show how costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. We assume that choices made by individuals give rise to Nash equilibrium behavior. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. In particular we find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections as the maximum infection cost in the government's objective function is increased. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction without government intervention. The infection costs at which this switch occurs depend on how costly the intervention is to the government. We find optimal interventions that are quite different to the case when interventions are cost-free. Finally, we identify a novel analytic solution for the Nash equilibrium behavior for constant infection cost.","output":"Rational social distancing policy during epidemics with limited healthcare capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a well-established fact that the human beings are the social beings  But many a times in a specific situations or circumstances, human beings are forced to adopt and practice social distancing With the recent outbreak of the pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19), people around the world have been advised by the authorities to practice social distancing This chapter is a modest attempt to study the impact of artificial intelligence on social distancing AI has contributed and has helped people in different ways in order to maintain social distance The current situation as well as the advancement of AI in dealing with it has sociological, economic, political, cultural and environmental consequences on the lives of the people all over the world The present chapter attempts to study the impact of artificial intelligence on maintaining social distancing The data for understanding the impact on the lives of people shall be collected from the secondary sources as collection of primary data is not possible in this time of coronavirus The analysis has been done through different case studies related to various technologies which with the help of AI aid in facilitating social distancing and in turn curbing the menace of coronavirus ? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Social Distancing and Artificial IntelligenceUnderstanding the Duality in the Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality Despite significant progress since the emergence of this disease, efficacious therapeutics are still urgently required Infection is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms and varying disease severity In severe cases, a multi-organ disease is apparent, involving the respiratory, coagulation, immune and cardiac systems A central tenant of severe disease is an excessive immune response to infection leading to a cytokine storm and associated organ and tissue damage Immunological therapies capable of attenuating the cytokine storm may therefore provide novel treatment options, and the present study explored whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the amniotic fluid (AF) and their derivatives, through their immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, and regenerative functions, could provide such an option Next Generation Sequencing analysis of MSCs isolated from human AF identified a plethora of molecules with the potential to positively influence the prognosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection patients These included mRNAs involved in the regulation of several immune pathways that are basis of the impaired immune response and cytokine storm caused seen in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, such as: HIF-1, IL-17, Toll-like receptors, RAP1, TNF, WNT, PI3K-Akt and NF-kappa B signalling AF-MSCs also contained bioactive molecules involved in respiratory endothelial protection and repair, such as VEGF, IL-1, TGF-?1, EGFR, in extracellular matrix re-organization or associated with cardiac muscle cell function Analysis of non-coding RNAs identified the presence of microRNAs that regulate macrophage polarization (towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype) and attenuate inflammation, as well as regulate the host response to viral infection Among those, exosomal miRNAs have been also identified Building upon these observations, further efforts will be made to elucidate the potential therapeutic use of AF-MSCs and their derivatives in combating the immune-related side effects of SARS-CoV-2 The successful incorporation of such an MSC-based therapy into the treatment regimen of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients has significant potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19","output":"Stem cells from the amniotic fluid: a promising tool to face the cytokine storm associated to SARS-CoV-2 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of diagnostics and medical devices has historically been concentrated in high-income countries, despite a significant need to expand healthcare services to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

The Act mandates requests and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, as well as stay-at-home requests. Although there have been no penalties as of January 2021, these requests and orders limit freedom of movement and establishment, guaranteed rights under the Japanese Constitution. This article poses the following research question: \\"Does the Japanese Constitution allow measures against COVID-19 such as requests and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, and stay-at-home requests?\\" It also asks: \\"Are measures with penalties allowed by the Constitution?\\" This paper introduces constitutional concepts that guarantee or limit individual freedom. Concepts that guarantee individual freedoms include freedom of establishment and movement. These freedoms derive from the constitutional values of freedom to choose one's occupation and choose and change one's residence (Art. 22) and the right to own or hold property (Art. 29). Concepts that limit individual freedom include the right to life (Art. 13), welfare rights and public health (Art. 25), and public welfare (Art. 13). Individual freedom that threatens right to life, welfare rights and public health, and public welfare may not be guaranteed. This paper argues that since measures against COVID-19 are considered public welfare, the Constitution allows the limiting of freedom of establishment and movement. Furthermore, from the perspectives of the right to life, welfare rights, and public health, the government is responsible for reducing the risk to life from COVID-19. It also argues that the Constitution permits measures with penalties, while proportionality needs to be considered.","output":"[COVID-19 measures and the Japanese Constitution]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and even the world.

Whether specific infections are of greater or lesser protective value is an important question if strategies are to be derived to mimic the beneficial effects of childhood infection whilst avoiding morbidity and potential mortality of the natural pathogens. Infection by respiratory viruses is a major trigger of wheezing in infants and of exacerbations of asthma in older children. Viruses are detected in up to 85% of such episodes.

In April 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified of a large cluster of students with COVID-19 at an urban university after spring break. A total of 158 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed among undergraduate students during March 15-May 3, 2021; the majority (114; 72.2%) lived in on-campus dormitories. CDPH evaluated the role of travel and social connections, as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants, on transmission. Among 140 infected students who were interviewed, 89 (63.6%) reported recent travel outside Chicago during spring break, and 57 (40.7%) reported indoor social exposures. At the time of the outbreak, undergraduate-aged persons were largely ineligible for vaccination in Chicago; only three of the students with COVID-19 (1.9%) were fully vaccinated. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 104 specimens revealed multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting several nearly simultaneous introductions. Most specimens (66; 63.5%) were B.1.1.222, a lineage not widely detected in Chicago before or after this outbreak. These results demonstrate the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks on university campuses after widespread student travel during breaks, at the beginning of new school terms, and when students participate in indoor social gatherings. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, colleges and universities should encourage COVID-19 vaccination; discourage unvaccinated students from travel, including during university breaks; implement serial COVID-19 screening among unvaccinated persons after university breaks; encourage masking; and implement universal serial testing for students based on community transmission levels.","output":"Multiple Variants of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Outbreak After Spring Break  Chicago, Illinois, MarchCMay 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Standard Precautions are the foundation of all infection control programs and include infection control practices that apply to all patients and situations regardless of whether the infection status is suspected, confirmed or unknown.

In fibromyalgia patients, these disorders are part of the large clinical picture of the syndrome. Fibromyalgia management is especially based on a regular practice of physical activity. Lockdown imposed a break in rhythms, requiring a restructuring of scheduling. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the experiences of fibromyalgia patients during COVID-19 lockdown using a qualitative analysis. Method: 19 patients (52  9 years old) who completed a 3-month therapeutic education and/or supervised physical activity program were invited to participate (Fimouv study, Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04107948). A sociologist collected data by means of semi-structured interviews and analyzed them using thematic content analysis. Results: Lockdown exacerbated the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, but adjusting the rhythms of life to fluctuations of these symptoms allowed a better quality of life. Patients felt the lack of physical activity and 68% found alternatives to remain physically active. The reduction of social constraints allowed them to better contend with their pathology. Fibromyalgia stopped being a main priority. Conclusion: Lockdown was positively experienced by fibromyalgia patients. They linked the absence of physical activity with increased pain and fatigue. Nevertheless, reducing social constraints could be a key for fibromyalgia management, where symptoms seemed to take less space in everyday life.

Specifically, we focused on the relationships between ICT use and perceived importance of social connectedness and future anxiety, while considering relevant personality and psychosocial factors. A U.S. sample of 394 adults answered questions about ICT use, pandemic-related reactions and actions, demographics, and psychosocial factors via an online survey. Using logistic regression, findings indicated that personality (extraversion and conscientiousness) and psychosocial (need to belong and perceived attachment to phone) factors, types of ICT as news source, and gender were associated with perceived importance of social connectedness. Neuroticism, time spent on ICT for social purposes, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were associated with future anxiety. In addition, using Mann-Whitney U test, people who rated higher on importance of social connectedness had higher ICT use, both in terms of types and time spent on ICT. Overall, results are consistent with the idea that technology is a coping tool during the pandemic and balanced use can lead to feelings of social connectedness and less future anxiety. Therefore, it is important for authorities to align their messaging and outreach with people's psychosocial, personality, and health considerations through ICT channels while empowering ICT users to be responsible for their interactions with the technology.","output":"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Usage during COVID-19: Motivating Factors and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The principles and use of plasmapheresis are often little understood by intensivists.

Such examples are the modern industrial platforms that frequently are reticent to share data. In such situations, the only option is to work with synthetic data obtained by simulation. Regarding simulated data, a limitation could consist in the fact that the data are not appropriate for research, based on poor quality or limited quantity. In such cases, the design of algorithms that are tested on that data does not give credible results. For avoiding such situations, we consider that mathematically grounded data-quality assessments should be designed according to the specific type of problem that must be solved. In this paper, we approach a multivariate type of prediction whose results finally can be used for binary classification. We propose the use of a mathematically grounded data-quality assessment, which includes, among other things, the analysis of predictive power of independent variables used for prediction. We present the assumptions that should be passed by the synthetic data. Different threshold values are established by a human assessor.

We explore how such temporary interruption may shape future RSV epidemiology and what factors drive the associated uncertainty. Methods We developed an age-structured dynamic transmission model to simulate pre-pandemic RSV infections and hospitalisations. We sampled parameters governing RSV seasonality, immunity acquisition and duration of post-infection immunity and retained those simulations that qualitatively fit the UK's pre-pandemic epidemiology. From Spring 2020 to Summer 2021 we assumed a 50% reduced contact frequency, returning to pre-pandemic levels from mid-May 2021. We simulated transmission forwards until 2023 and evaluated the impact of the sampled parameters on the projected trajectories of RSV hospitalisations. Results Following a lifting of contact restrictions in summer 2021 the model replicated an out-of-season resurgence of RSV. If unmitigated, paediatric RSV hospitalisation incidence in the 2021/22 season was projected to increase by 32% to 67% compared to pre-pandemic levels. The size of the increase depended most on whether infection risk was primarily determined by immunity acquired from previous exposure or general immune maturation. While infants were less affected, the increase in seasonal hospitalisation incidence exceeded 100% in 1-2 year old children and 275% in 2-5 year old children, respectively, in some simulations where immunity from previous exposure dominated. Consequently, the average age of a case increased by 1 to 5 months, most markedly if there was strong immunity acquisition from previous exposure. If immunity to infection was largely determined by age rather than previous exposure, the 2021/22 season started earlier and lasted longer but with a peak incidence lower or similar to pre-pandemic levels. For subsequent seasons, simulations suggested a quick return to pre-pandemic epidemiology, with some slight oscillating behaviour possible depending on the strength of post-exposure immunity. Conclusion COVID-19 mitigation measures stopped RSV circulation in the 2020/21 season and generated immunity debt that will likely lead to a temporary increase in RSV burden in the season following the lifting of restrictions, particularly in 1 to 5 year old children. A more accurate understanding of immunity drivers for RSV is needed to better predict the size of such an increase and plan a potential expansion of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures.","output":"Determinants of RSV epidemiology following suppression through pandemic contact restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most patients recover from acute COVID-19, some experience postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC).

ME/CFS is a debilitating condition, often triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to years-long debilitating symptoms including profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive deficits, and orthostatic intolerance. Some are skeptical that either ME/CFS or long COVID-19 involves underlying biological abnormalities. However, in this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases.

Alterations, such as low placental weight, accelerated villous maturation, decidual vasculopathy, infarcts, thrombosis of fetal placental vessels, and chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI), have been described. OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical data and the placental morphological and morphometric changes of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 group) in comparison with the placentas of non-infected pregnant women, matched for maternal age and comorbidities, besides gestational age of delivery (Control group). METHOD: The patients in the COVID-19 and the Control group were matched for maternal age, gestational age, and comorbidities. The morphological analysis of placentas was performed using Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement. The quantitative morphometric evaluation included perimeter diameter and number of tertiary villi, number of sprouts and knots, evaluation of deposition of villous fibrin, and deposition of intra-villous collagen I and III by Sirius Red. Additionally, Hofbauer cells (HC) were counted within villi by immunohistochemistry with CD68 marker. RESULTS: Compared to controls, symptomatic women in the COVID-19 group were more likely to have at least one comorbidity, to evolve to preterm labor and infant death, and to have positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in their concepts. Compared to controls, placentas in the COVID-19 group were more likely to show features of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion. In the COVID-19 group, placentas of symptomatic women were more likely to show CHI. No significant results were found after morphometric analysis. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly with the severe course, are more likely to exhibit an adverse fetal outcome, with slightly more frequent histopathologic findings of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion, and CHI. The morphometric changes found in the placentas of the COVID-19 group do not seem to be different from those observed in the Control group, as far as maternal age, gestational age, and comorbidities are paired.

Selective breeding for the naturally occurring social immune trait \\"hygienic behavior\\" has emerged as one sustainable approach to reducing the mites' impact on honey bees. To expand our understanding of hygienic triggers and improve hygienic selection tools, we tested the hypothesis that the cuticular compounds (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene, previously associated with unhealthy honey bee brood and/or brood targeted for hygiene, are triggers of honey bee hygienic behavior independent of brood health. In support of our hypothesis, application of synthetic (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene onto brood and brood cell caps significantly increased hygienic behavior compared to application of similarly structured hydrocarbon controls (Z)-16-dotriacontene and (Z)-7-pentadecene. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between colony-level hygienic responses to (Z)-10-tritriacontene and the traditional freeze-killed brood assay for selection of hygienic honey bee stocks. These results confirm biological activity of (Z)-6-pentadecene and reveal (Z)-10-tritriacontene as a novel hygiene trigger. They also support development of improved tools for honey bee colony monitoring and hygienic selection, and thus may accelerate development of honey bee stocks with greater resistance to Varroa and associated pathogens.","output":"Cuticular pheromones stimulate hygienic behavior in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this article is to illustrate Chinas influence on global economy through data comparative analysis of national interdependence anditsrelationto especially the economic impact in time of a major event such as a new coronavirus. Design/methodology/approach: The author analyzes the impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy and how it can be transmitted to other countries through the global industrial chain according to the proportion of China in the world economy. In this study, the author used literature analysis, statistical methods, inductive methods, and descriptive research methods. Findings: The author found through research thatin the era of globalization, each countrys economic operations and peoples lives are inseparable from other countries. The role of different countries in the international division of labor is becoming clearer. In the face of global disasters, such as this epidemic, when a countrys economy is affected, it will be transmitted to other countries through the global value chain in different ways. The method and the results of transmission will be affected by the different policies of each country. Originality/value: Globalization has both positive and negative effects on human beings. Overall, the author considers that positive effects are greater than negative.

Although the efficacy of ERAS protocol has been well established, its compliance following the resumption of elective services is unknown. Our study aims to assess the level of adherence in the postoperative arm of ERAS in a large district general hospital (DGH). METHODS: Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were audited prospectively between 1(st) September 2020 and 15(th) October 2020. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) of the 23 patients audited [11(48%) male] was 65 (16) years. Of the cases audited, 17 (74%) had malignant pathology and 6 (26%) were benign. The overall mean compliance score was 4.91 out of 7 (70%). Nasogastric tube was not used in most patients [22(96%)]. However, compliance was poor with regards to opioid avoidance [2(8%)]. Majority of cases complied with early discontinuation of intravenous fluids administration and catheter removal, 14 (61%) and 13 (57%) respectively. 18 patients (78%) resumed oral intake by the first day after surgery and 21 patients (91%) mobilised by the third postoperative day. Higher compliance was significantly associated with decreased length of stay (p = 0.01) but did not reveal significant association with 30-day morbidity. CONCLUSION: Although the compliance to postoperative ERAS protocol is generally good, our study highlighted a strong need to improve the postoperative practice of opioid avoidance. Stricter adherence should be aimed for as it is associated with shorter hospital stay which is particularly important in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","output":"EP.WE.467 A Snapshot Audit on the Compliance of Postoperative ERAS Protocol Following the Resumption of Elective Colorectal Surgical Operations in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to describe behaviour and roles of community leaders in the COVID-19 prevention at Jayaraga Village, Garut District.

How should we divide the sequence into segments to better capture the dynamics? Throughout human history, infectious diseases (e.g., the Black Death and COVID-19) have been serious threats. Consequently, understanding and forecasting the evolving patterns of epidemic events are critical for prevention and decision making. To this end, epidemic models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which effectively describe dynamic systems in many fields, have been employed. However, a single epidemic model is not enough to capture long-term dynamics of epidemic events especially when the dynamics heavily depend on external factors (e.g., lockdown and the capability to perform tests). In this work, we demonstrate that properly dividing the event sequence regarding COVID-19 (specifically, the numbers of active cases, recoveries, and deaths) into multiple segments and fitting a simple epidemic model to each segment leads to a better fit with fewer parameters than fitting a complex model to the entire sequence. Moreover, we propose a methodology for balancing the number of segments and the complexity of epidemic models, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Our methodology is (a) Automatic: not requiring any user-defined parameters, (b) Model-agnostic: applicable to any ODE-based epidemic models, and (c) Effective: effectively describing and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in 70 countries.","output":"Simple epidemic models with segmentation can be better than complex ones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution causes the largest death toll among environmental risks globally, but interventions to purify ambient air remain inadequate. Vegetation and green spaces have shown reductive effects on air-borne pollutants concentrations, especially of particulate matter (PM). Guidance on green space utilisation for air quality control remains scarce, however, as does its application in practise. To strengthen the foundation for research and interventions, we undertook a critical review of the state of science from a public health perspective. We used inter-disciplinary search strategies for published reviews on green spaces and air pollution in key scientific databases. Using the PRISMA checklist, we systematically identified reviews with quantitative analyses. For each of the presented PM mitigation mechanisms, we conducted additional searches focused on the most recent articles published between 2016 and early 2021. The included reviews differentiate three mitigation mechanisms of green spaces for PM: deposition, dispersion and modification. The most studied mechanism is deposition, particularly measures of mass and settling velocity of PM on plant leaves. We consolidate how green space setups differ by scale and context in their potentials to reduce peak exposures, stationary (point) or mobile (line) pollution sources, and the potentially most harmful PM components. The assessed findings suggest diverse optimisation options for green space interventions, particularly concerning plant selection, spatial setup, ventilation and maintenance - all alongside the consideration of supplementary vegetation effects like on temperature or water. Green spaces' reductive effects on air-borne PM concentrations are considerable, multi-mechanistic and varied by scale, context and vegetation characteristics. Such effect-modifying factors must be considered when rethinking public space design, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Weak linkages amid involved disciplines motivate the development of a research framework to strengthen health-oriented guidance. We conclude on an urgent need for an integrated and risk-based approach to PM mitigation through green space interventions.","output":"How can vegetation protect us from air pollution?

Furthermore, it sought to explore factors that were associated with patterns of longitudinal changes in home-based arts engagement. METHOD: Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 29,147 adults in the UK who were followed up for 22 weeks from 21 March to 21 August 2020. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. RESULTS: Our analyses identified five classes of growth trajectories. There were two stable classes showing little change in arts engagement over time (64.4% in total), two classes showing initial increases in arts engagement followed by declines as restrictions were eased (29.8%), and one class showing slight declines during strict lockdown followed by an increase in arts engagement after the easing of restrictions (5.9%). A range of factors were found to be associated with class membership of these arts engagement trajectories, such as age, gender, education, income, employment status, and health. CONCLUSION: There is substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal changes in home-based arts engagement. For participants whose engagement changed over time, growth trajectories of arts engagement were related to changes in lockdown measures. These findings suggest that some individuals may have drawn on the arts when they needed them the most, such as during the strict lockdown period, even if they usually had lower levels of arts engagement before the pandemic.

The study explored vaccination attitudes and hesitancy with regard to seasonal influenza and the anticipated Covid-19 vaccines among healthcare professionals and students. METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed through electronic mail to healthcare professionals working in Maltas Health Division, at University of Malta, and in community pharmacies, and to members of Malta College of Family Doctors. RESULTS: The response rate was 18.60% (n = 1802). The percentages of those who took the influenza vaccine last year (2019) and who will take it this year (2020) increased across professionals, highest for family doctors and lowest for trainees in family medicine. The proportion of those likelier to take the Covid-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Both family doctor trainees and nurses showed the highest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were mostly related to insufficient knowledge, although pharmacists (community, academic and students) were concerned about the rapid approval of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: An increase in influenza vaccine uptake is expected in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Of concern is the hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccine particular within healthcare professionals, a cohort expected to be insightful and potential role models for the community. The associated hesitancy for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy, which brings forward the need for healthcare professionals to be engaged in education, vaccination policies and administration in order to ensure compliance.

Aim: To study and analyze the application of positive-pressure connector in invasive blood pressure monitoring in coronary interventional therapy. Methods: From October 2017 to October 2019, a total of 120 patients admitted to Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou, Hebei, China, for coronary interventional therapy with invasive blood pressure monitoring were selected and divided into a control group and an experimental group by drawing lots with 60 patients in each group. Positive-pressure connector was used for invasive blood pressure detection in the experimental group, and heparin cap connector was used for invasive blood pressure detection in the control group. The effectiveness and safety of blood pressure monitoring in the two groups were compared, and the influence of different joints on invasive blood pressure monitoring was analyzed. Results: The influencing factors of puncture efficiency in the experimental group (6.67%) were significantly lower than those in the control group (30.00%) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in catheter bending between the experimental group and the control group (P > 0.05). The experimental group exhibited a remarkably higher puncture safety rate (93%) compared to the control group (67%) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in arterial blood pressure between the two groups with different indwelling time (P > 0.05).

The studied decision drivers were capital costs, operating costs (including fuel consumption), a combination of capital and operating costs, and net present value. Where investors used a weighted combination of capital cost and operating costs, a natural gas uptake of ~12PJ was obtained and the highest cumulative emissions reduction was obtained, 2 Mt CO(2) in the period from 2020 to 2050. Conversely if net present value alone is used, cumulative emissions reduction in the same period was lower, 1.6 Mt CO(2), and the cumulative uptake of natural gas was equal to 15PJ. Results show how the differing upfront investment cost of the technology options could cause prevalence of high-carbon fuels, particularly heavy fuel oil, in the final mix.

The tiotropium bromide spray (TBS) (Spiriva?

However, the technique of using TBS inhaler in the real world is unclear. Objective To evaluate techniques in using TBS inhaler and investigate the association between the patient characteristics and the correct use of TBS inhaler. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 74 COPD patients who used TBS inhaler device for more than 3 months. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. The technique of using TBS inhaler was evaluated step by step. Incorrect use was defined as the patient's inability to complete the key steps in the inhalation manoeuvre. The percentage of incorrect use was compared between the groups. Risk factors related to incorrect use were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 74 participants, only 2 (2.7%) patients completed all the steps correctly, and 48 (64.9%) patients misused the key steps in the inhalation manoeuvre. Incorrect preparation of the TBS inhaler for the first use was the most frequently misused step, accounting for 77.0%. Factors associated with misuse of TBS inhaler included the educational background (p=0.010), living state (p=0.031) and COPD assessment test (CAT) score (p=0.005) of the patients. Additionally, logistic regression analysis showed that the COPD duration was significantly associated with the incorrect use (p=0.019). Compared with patients with a higher educational background, patients with an elementary school background [OR 11652.99, CI: 22.72-5975697.72], junior high school background [OR 7187.78, CI: 16.41-3146787] and high school background [OR 1563, CI: 4.27-572329.67] were more likely to misuse TBS inhaler. Patients living with their spouses alone were also more likely to commit errors in using TBS inhaler as compared with those living with their children [OR 12.29, CI of 1.14-1.96]. Clinical factors like the COPD symptoms were relative to the technical use of the device. Better technique was accompanied by a lower CAT score [OR 1.49, CI of 1.14-1.96]. Conclusion The incorrect use of TBS inhaler was common in COPD patients. Healthcare providers should not only teach the patients about the drug preparation but help them use the inhaler correctly. Special attention should be paid to patients with a short COPD duration and a low educational background and those who live without the company of their children.

Adolescents are particularly prone to mental health issues. The present study aims to estimate prevalence of depression and anxiety and its determinants among school-going adolescents in Kashmir valley of India. RESULTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents and Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire were used to screen for depression and anxiety among school-going adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years during January and February 2021. Out of the 439 adolescents who had responded, 426 (97.03%) were included in final analysis. The adolescents had a mean age of 17.5 + 1.26 years and comprised of 57% males. The overall prevalence of depression was 16% and was associated with a past history of COVID-19 infection. Anxiety was present in 20% of adolescents. The prevalence was 14% for boys and 27.5% for girls.

Most of the countries of the world are in a lockdown of varying severity to break the chain of transmission. Many non-essential healthcare practices have been shut down to impose social distancing against a population whose slogan has been freedom of movement. Several healthcare providers have also been caught off guard. Many are not well-versed in the use of transmission-based safeguards, and the dental community, is no different. In this article, we identify the challenges faced by the oral and dental care providers, whose procedures generate a significant amount of aerosol, which can be a significant source of disease transmission within the community. It further describes the dynamics of aerosol spread and various strategies to minimise aerosol generation.

However, it is susceptible to the thermal shock when working in a low temperature environment, which will cause a time-consuming and inaccurate human body temperature measurements. To overcome the effects of thermal shock, a hybrid temperature compensation method combining hardware and algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the principle of infrared temperature measurement is described and the influence of thermal shock on infrared thermometer is analyzed. Then, the hybrid temperature compensation scheme is constructed by mounting a heating ring on the infrared sensor shell, and using the proportional integral derivative (PID) algorithm and the pulse width modulation (PWM) technology to control it heating. In this way, the internal ambient temperature of infrared sensor can be raised rapidly closing to the external ambient temperature, and the stable outputs of the infrared sensor are also accelerated. Finally, some experiments are carried out in a laboratory. The results show that the proposed method can quickly and accurately measure the temperature of standard black body when the ambient temperatures are 5 , 15 and 25 Celsius respectively, the measurement error is only 0.2 Celsius , and the measurement time is less than 2 seconds.

As temperature inversion altitude increases, the pollutants are dispersed in a greater thickness of the atmosphere and the concentration of the pollutants decreases on the earth's surface. At the same time, the number of patients with Covid-19 reduces. Although investigation of the effect of severity of pollutants on the number of coronavirus patients showed poor significance level during the periods, a decreasing and increasing relationship was shown. in 1- and 9C14-day periods, the correlation coefficient was negative. As a result, the effect of the severity of pollutants and Covid-19 is not observed on 1- and9C14-day periods. Conversely, during2C8-day periods, a positive correlation coefficient was observed. Therefore, the time between infection with the virus and the onset of symptoms of this disease is between 2 and 8 days, in which the 3-day period showed the highest correlation.

However, the short half-life and reactivity of NO have made precise, tunable delivery difficult. As such, conventional methodologies have generally relied on donors that spontaneously release NO at different rates, and delivery profiles have largely been constrained to decaying dynamics. In recent years, the possibility of finely controlling NO release, for instance with light, has become achievable and this raises the question of how delivery dynamics influence therapeutic potential. Here we investigated this relationship using Escherichia coli as a model organism and an approach that incorporated both experimentation and mathematical modeling. We found that the best performing delivery mode was dependent on the NO payload, and developed a mathematical model to quantitatively dissect those observations. Those analyses suggested that the duration of respiratory inhibition was a major determinant of NO-induced growth inhibition. Inspired by this, we constructed a delivery schedule that leveraged that insight to extend the antimicrobial activity of NO far beyond what was achievable by traditional delivery dynamics.

The implementation of new modes of transport in an urban environment requires the study of several factors that allow their incorporation on the transport system in the most efficient method. These factors include reviewing the organization of the transport system. The concept of transport system organization, financing models and common trends was defined. Finally, the Public Transport Authority was created to define global objectives and establish specific policies to achieve them was suggested.Design/methodology/approach> After the analysis of the status quo of transport systems organization, the financing and management schemes, both infrastructure projects and the provision of rail service were analysed. The characteristics of the PPP scheme (PublicCPrivate Participation) contract, advantages and disadvantages, its structure, and the definition and share of risk (matrix of risk, rights and obligations of the parties) as a key element of the PPP contracts were defined. From this point onwards, the legal framework in force in Kuwait was analysed, particularly the administrative and commercial regulations applying to this project and the authors verified that the economic-financial viability analysis suggested before can be established under this framework.Findings> For the viability of these alternatives, the authors developed a simulation economic-financial model that reflects Financial Statements for the Society Vehicle Project and are considered some minimum thresholds of profitability, both from the viewpoint of the partners sponsoring the project as from the standpoint of lenders, which make attractive participation of private initiative.

There is a huge pressure on the hospital services and in particular, on the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Describing the need for critical care as well as the chance of being discharged from hospital according to patient characteristics, is essential for a more efficient hospital management. The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the ICU and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without having previously entered the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities (18% overall) in contrast to CKD which had the largest effect, but presented only in 7% of those admitted to ICU and in 1% of those who got discharged. For instance, within 5 days a 50-year-old male had 19% (95% C.I.: [15,23]) probability of entering the ICU if he had none of these comorbidities, yet this risk jumped to 31% (95% C.I.: [20,46]) if he had also CKD, and to 27% in the presence of asthma/COPD (95% C.I.: [19,36]) or of weakened immune system (95% C.I.: [16,42]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful insight in describing the probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","output":"Probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to patient characteristics in the designated COVID-19 hospital of Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As social media becomes increasingly prominent in our day to day lives, it is increasingly important to detect informative content and prevent the spread of disinformation and unverified rumours.

Both testicles were normal in shape and size without any gross lesions. Dog 2 had a pyotraumatic dermatitis. The cases were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sequences obtained showed 100% identity with those of D. repens isolated from human scrotum in Croatia. The treatment with moxidectin 2.5% and imidacloprid 10%/kg was effective in eliminating microfilariae after just one application, as demonstrated by negative modified Knotts tests and PCR analyses of blood samples. This status was maintained during the post-treatment observation period. The classical localization of D. repens in dogs is in subcutaneous tissues, within nodules or free; however, it can also occur with some frequency in testicles, as described in humans. The infection can be associated with circulating eosinophilia or pyotraumatic dermatitis, as reported in this study. Thus, in endemic areas, it is advisable to carefully inspect the removed testicles at neutering since parasite localization can take place without any macroscopic changes. Moreover, in the case of circulating eosinophilia or pyotraumatic dermatitis, investigations should include modified Knotts test and PCR to ensure that D. repens is not the cause of these alterations.

Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. Setting: Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service. Participants: 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results: 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population.

The aim of this research was to use a viral cell cycle model of SARS-CoV-2 to explore the potential impact drugs, or combinations of drugs, that act at different stages in the viral life cycle might have on various metrics of infection outcome relevant in the early stages of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Using a target-cell limited model structure that has been used to characterize viral load dynamics from COVID-19 patients, we performed simulations to inform on the combinations of therapeutics targeting specific rate constants. The endpoints and metrics included viral load area under the curve (AUC), duration of viral shedding and epithelial cells infected. Based on the known kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, we rank ordered potential targeted approaches involving repurposed, low-potency agents. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that targeting multiple points central to viral replication within infected host cells or release from those cells is a viable strategy for reducing both viral load and host cell infection. In addition, we observed that the time-window opportunity for a therapeutic intervention to effect duration of viral shedding exceeds the effect on sparing epithelial cells from infection or impact on viral load AUC. Furthermore, the impact on reduction on duration of shedding may extend further in patients who exhibit a prolonged shedder phenotype.

Testing is crucial to track the spread of disease during a pandemic, and to swiftly permit public health interventions including isolation, quarantine, and appropriate clinical management of afflicted individuals. The key components of viral diagnostic tests are (1) collection of the appropriate sample (blood, nasal swab, and throat swab), (2) availability of the genetic and proteomic sequences of the novel virus for analysis, and (3) rapid and accurate laboratory testing methods. The current gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Other relevant laboratory methods include enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for viral antibody and antigen detection, and serum viral neutralization (SVN) assays for antibody neutralization determination.

METHODS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study of sedation practices for critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation was conducted in 8 ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. The study population was a sequential cohort of 86 critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Data characterizing the sedative medications, doses, drug combinations, and duration of administration were collected daily and compared to published recommendations for sedation of critically ill patients without COVID-19. The associations between drug doses, number of drugs administered, baseline patient characteristics, and inflammatory markers were investigated. RESULTS: Among the study cohort, propofol and hydromorphone were the most common initial drug combination, with these medications being used on a given day in up to 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. The doses of sedative and analgesic infusions increased for patients over the first 10 days, reaching or exceeding the upper limits of published dosage guidelines for propofol (48% of patients), dexmedetomidine (29%), midazolam (7.7%), ketamine (32%), and hydromorphone (38%).

METHODS: We sent a survey to physicians worldwide through the network of the World Stroke Organization to investigate the impact of COVID\\\\19 on stroke clinics. To farther along in recovering from the outbreak, we reviewed stroke and other neurology outpatient clinic visits (approximately 50% were stroke related) and the number of inpatient services from December 2019 to July 2020 in a large neurology department in Shanghai, China, where there was no official city lockdown. RESULTS: We received 112 valid survey responses from 46 countries, representing all continents except for Antarctica. Only seven of the survey responders (7/112, 6.3%) reported that they have kept their outpatient clinics open as usual, but they did exercise increased precautions for COVID\\\\19 by following recent guidelines regarding use of personal protective equipment and isolation techniques. The remainder of the respondents have either reduced outpatient clinic services or suspended outpatient clinics completely. Telephone consultation or telemedicine with video capability was used for new patients or follow\\\\ups, with limited in\\\\person evaluations when necessary. Outpatient clinic visits and inpatient services from a large tertiary hospital in China decreased dramatically during the peak period of the outbreak, but then rebounded back quickly following the partial or full recovery from the outbreak. Compared with the recovery process of inpatient services, outpatient clinic visits decreased faster and recovered much slower. This is consistent with our global survey data which indicates that some outpatient clinics have rescheduled their outpatient visits for 3 to 6 months.

Several prognostic models have been validated but few of them are implemented in daily practice. The objective of the study was to validate a machine-learning risk prediction model using easy-to-obtain parameters, potentially available at home, to help identifying patients with COVID-19 who are at higher risk of death. Methods: The training cohort included all patients admitted to Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli with COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to November 5, 2020. Afterwards, the model was tested on all patients admitted to the same hospital with COVID-19 from November 6, 2020 to February 5 2021. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.The out-of-sample performance of the model was estimated from the training set in terms of Area under the Receiving Operator Curve (AUROC) and classification matrix statistics by averaging the results of 5-fold cross validation repeated 3-times and comparing the results with those obtained on the test set. An explanation analysis of the model, based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), is also presented. To assess the subsequent time evolution, the change in paO2/FiO2 (P/F) at 48 hours after the baseline measurement was plotted against its baseline value. Results: Among the 921 patients included in the training cohort, 120 died (13%). Variables selected for the model were age, platelet count, SpO2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and sodium. The results of the 5-fold cross-validation repeated 3-times gave AUROC of 0.87, and statistics of the classification matrix to the Youden index as follows: sensitivity 0.840, specificity 0.774, negative predictive value 0.971. Then, the model was tested on a new population (n=1463) in which the mortality rate was 22.6 %. The test model showed AUROC 0.818, sensitivity 0.813, specificity 0.650, negative predictive value 0.922. Considering the first quartile of the predicted risk score (low-risk score group), the mortality rate was 1.6%, 17.8% in the second and third quartile (high-risk score group) and 53.5% in the fourth quartile (very high-risk score group). The three risk score groups showed good discrimination for the P/F value at admission, and a positive correlation was found for the low-risk class to P/F at 48 hours after admission (adjusted R-squared= 0.48). Conclusions: We developed a predictive model of death for people with SARS-CoV-2 infection by including only easy-to-obtain variables (abnormal blood count, BUN, C-reactive protein, sodium and lower SpO2). It demonstrated good accuracy and high power of discrimination. The simplicity of the model makes the risk prediction applicable for patients at home, in the Emergency Department, or during hospitalization.","output":"A Machine-learning Parsimonious Multivariable Predictive Model of Mortality Risk in Patients With Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Optimization of factors affecting aerosol delivery during mechanical ventilation in the pediatric population is important. We hypothesized that increasing the tidal volume (V(T)), using a vibrating mesh nebulizer, and placing the nebulizer at the ventilator would increase lung dose/delivery efficiency. METHODS Continuous-output jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers loaded with albuterol (2.5 mg/3 mL) were compared when placed before the Y-piece and at the ventilator. The model consisted of a ventilator operated in pressure-regulated volume control ventilation mode at a breathing frequency of 20 breaths/min, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, FIO2 of 0.4, inspiratory time of 0.75 s, and bias flow of 0.5 L/min with a humidifier (37  1.5C) and an adult heated-wired circuit. V(T) values of 100, 150, 200, and 300 mL were studied. The circuit was connected in series to a 5.5-mm inner diameter endotracheal tube with a filter (lung dose) interposed between them. Delivery efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the nominal dose captured on the filter. Albuterol content was analyzed by spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS No differences in lung dose/delivery efficiency were found at different V(T) values for the jet nebulizer (both positions) and the vibrating mesh nebulizer (ventilator). Lung dose/delivery efficiency was higher (P < .02) at a VT of 100 mL compared with the other volumes tested. The vibrating mesh nebulizer had higher lung dose/delivery efficiency compared with the jet nebulizer only when placed before the Y-piece. Moving the nebulizers from before the Y-piece to the ventilator increased lung dose/delivery efficiency for all conditions tested except the vibrating mesh nebulizer at a V(T) of 100 mL (P = .36). CONCLUSIONS Optimization of inhaled drug delivery during pediatric mechanical ventilation should include careful selection of the type of delivery device and its placement in the ventilator circuit.

However, neonatal thermal care guidelines applicable to intra-hospital transport beyond the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and during surgery or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are lacking. The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of infants normothermic (36.5-37.5C) on return to NICU after management during surgery and MRI, and during standard clinical care in both environments. METHODS Sixty-two newborns requiring either surgery in the operating theatre (OT) (n = 41) or an MRI scan (n = 21) at the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne) NICU were prospectively studied. Core temperature, along with cardiorespiratory parameters, was continuously measured from 15 min prior to leaving the NICU until 60 min after returning. Passive and active warming (intra-operatively) was at clinician discretion. RESULTS The study reported 90% of infants were normothermic before leaving NICU: 86% (MRI) and 93% (OT). Only 52% of infants were normothermic on return to NICU (relative risk (RR) 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.31; number needed to harm (NNH) 2.6). Between departure from the NICU and commencement of surgery, core temperature decreased by mean 0.81C (95% CI 0.30-1.33; P = 0.0001, analysis of variance), with only 24% of infants normothermic when surgery began (P < 0.0001; RR 3.80 (95% CI 2.33-6.74); NNH 1.5). After an MRI, infants were a mean 0.41C (95% CI 0.16-0.67) colder than immediately before entering the scanner (P = 0.001, analysis of variance), with only 43% being normothermic (P = 0.003; RR 2.11 (95% CI 1.35-3.74); NNH 2.1).

Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiencies of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2, or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those &#916;ERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These \\"defective-in-third-cycle\\" BuPV &#916;ERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc protein, and the receptor binding domain of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPVs are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV &#916;ERNS replicon particles have potential as broad-spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins NPRO and ERNS are unique for the genus Pestivirus, but only NPRO has been demonstrated to be nonessential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it has always been previously shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1, or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS-defective BuPV particles showed clearly limited growth in cell culture but were capable of several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes, and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRPs). The noncytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provide a significant benefit for a possible use, e.g., as a vector vaccine platform.","output":"Autonomously Replicating RNAs of Bungowannah Pestivirus: ERNS Is Not Essential for the Generation of Infectious Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asymptomatic COVID\\\\19 testing programmes are being introduced in higher education institutions, but stakeholder views regarding the acceptability of mandating or incentivizing participation remain little understood.

However, health and social care have been an area of organizational and disciplinary differentiation and fragmentation. Though interventions to increase the effectiveness of collaboration and barriers to collaboration have been the subject of research, there has been a lack of an overview of the aims, characteristics, and impacts of these interventions. A deeper understanding helps to determine future research focus. Aim: The aim of this integrative review is to give an overview of aims, characteristics, and impacts of interventions fostering interdisciplinary or inter-organizational collaboration in health and social care. Method: The databases CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Worldcat were systematically searched using the terms: interventions, interdisciplinary, inter-organizational, and collaboration in health care. Snowballing and a cross reference check complemented the search strategy. A total of 367 unique records were found. Structuring and screening the literature for eligibility was conducted through the use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework (Moher et al., 2009) and using online review software. The review of the literature followed the guidelines for integrative review methodological rigour and data relevance using the online systematic review software Covidence (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). Covidence led to the inclusion of 28 studies. Findings and conclusion: Integrative synthesis shows that aims fostering interdisciplinary and inter-organizational collaboration are improving communication, teamwork, professional roles, conceptual underpinning, and the coordination of care. The main characteristics of the interventions are digital resources, simulation or role playing, learning conversations, collective activity, and implementing models or pathways. Impacts described include increased knowledge, improved collaboration, improved communication, enhanced role clarity, and developments around the systemic level of collaboration. Results suggest that interventions with aims and impacts on interpersonal normative aspects of collaboration beyond the focus on effectiveness and efficiency, are under-represented in the literature. To better understand how to improve these aspects of collaboration, it is expedient to research the value and characteristics of interventions beyond familiar forms, aims, and means. ? 2022 The Authors","output":"Interventions fostering interdisciplinary and inter-organizational collaboration in health and social care;an integrative literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide an insight into the life of survivors of critical COVID-19 in China.

Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected  15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected  8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases.

Previous studies explained such observed decline with the decrease in human mobility, whilst overlooking the meteorological changes (e.g., rainfall, wind speed) that could mediate air pollution level simultaneously. This pitfall could potentially lead to over- or under-estimation of the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution. Consequently, this study aims to re-evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on NO2 and PM2.5 pollutant level in Singapore, by incorporating the effect of meteorological parameters in predicting NO2 and PM2.5 baseline in 2020 using machine learning methods. The results found that NO2 and PM2.5 declined by a maximum of 38% and 36%, respectively, during lockdown period. As two proxies for change in human mobility, taxi availability and carpark availability were found to increase and decrease by a maximum of 12.6% and 9.8%, respectively, in 2020 from 2019 during lockdown. To investigate how human mobility influenced air pollutant level, two correlation analyses were conducted: one between PM2.5 and carpark availability changes at regional scale and the other between NO2 and taxi availability changes at a spatial resolution of 0.01o. The NO2 variation was found to be more associated with the change in human mobility, with the correlation coefficients vary spatially across Singapore. A cluster of stronger correlations were found in the South and East Coast of Singapore. Contrarily, PM2.5 and carpark availability had a weak correlation, which could be due to the limit of regional analyses.

Methods This is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial in 131 healthy adults. Trial vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. Primary outcomes were reactogenicity, safety labs, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response.

Method A study of 8 patients who received dexamethasone before the development of COVID-19. We evaluate clinical variables, imaging tests, cytokine release parameters, treatment used and patient evolution. Results All patients received a 6 mg/day dose with a mean duration of 4.5 days before admission. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed that most of them presented a severe extension; most patients had a slightly elevated level of cytokine release parameters. Three patients required high-flow oxygen therapy due to respiratory failure; none required orotracheal intubation or died.

Video consultations were introduced in March 2020, and this article presents the experiences gained by healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data was collected in June 2020 through focus-group interviews with healthcare professionals and through an anonymous online survey of patients who had attended video consultations during a period of three weeks in June 2020. RESULTS: The data from the focus-group interviews with seven rheumatologists and seven nurses were sorted into main thematic categories: patient, healthcare professional, consultation, and technology. The healthcare professionals felt that video consultations, with some exceptions, were appropriate in the follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, and especially for stable patients with no confounding issues. Of the 383 patients who were invited to participate, 139 (36 %) responded to the survey. The patients were largely satisfied with the video consultation, with a median score of 10 (quartiles 8-10) on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, however, 32 (27 %) patients considered the lack of clinical examination to be detrimental.

These lipophilic substances cannot be synthesized within the human body, and so people must include them in their diet. There is increasing interest in incorporating these bioactive lipids into functional foods designed to produce certain health benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and cholesterol-lowering properties. However, many of these lipids have poor compatibility with food matrices and low bioavailability because of their extremely low water solubility. Moreover, they may also chemically degrade during food storage or inside the human gut because they are exposed to certain stressors, such as high temperatures, oxygen, light, moisture, pH, and digestive/metabolic enzymes, which again reduces their bioavailability. Nanotechnology is a promising technology that can be used to overcome many of these limitations. The aim of this review is to highlight different kinds of nanoscale delivery systems that have been designed to encapsulate and protect bioactive lipids, thereby facilitating their handling, stability, food matrix compatibility, and bioavailability. These systems include nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), nanoliposomes, nanogels, and nano-particle stabilized Pickering emulsions.","output":"Utilization of Nanotechnology to Improve the Handling, Storage and Biocompatibility of Bioactive Lipids in Food Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, a higher proportion of patients with severe disease were found in older persons with comorbidities.

Methods. A cross-sectional, professional pharmacy organization listserverCbased online survey of a target group of health-system pharmacists across the United States was conducted. The survey was sent out through professional organization listservers and was anonymous and voluntary. The survey questionnaire included items regarding demographics and employment characteristics, COVID-19Crelated questions, a survey of respondents perceptions of the prevalence and severity of burnout, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial. Further studies of the consequences of burnout and STS during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","output":"Burnout and secondary traumatic stress in health-system pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although vaccine resources are being distributed worldwide, insufficient vaccine production remains a major obstacle to herd immunity.

We compared the sex distribution, age, comorbidities, and clinical laboratory results between normal patients and re-positive patients, and analysed the correlation between the significantly different indicators and the re-positive. Re-positive patients displayed a lower level of serum creatinine (63.38  4.94 U/L vs. 86.82  16.98 U/L; P =0.014) and lower albumin (34.70  5.46 g/L vs. 41.24  5.44 g/L, P =0.039) at the time of initial diagnosis.

Topics included: general company policy, regulatory aspects, dosage form selection, in-vitro, in-silico and (non-)clinical in-vivo methods, and food effects assessment. The survey results clearly underline the positive impact of the paediatric regulations and their overall uptake across the pharmaceutical industry. Even though significant improvements have been made in paediatric product development, major challenges remain. In this respect, dosage form selection faces a discrepancy between the youngest age groups (liquid products preference) and older subpopulations (adult formulation preference). Additionally, concerted research is needed in the development and validation of in-vitro tools and physiology based pharmacokinetic models tailored to the paediatric population, and in estimating the effect of non-standard and paediatric relevant foods.

The present study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic response of TCZ therapy in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients and its role as an effective modality of management. Methods: The present retrospective observational study included 30 admitted severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, treated with TCZ therapy on behalf of raised IL-6 levels. The patients' data concerning medical history, clinical manifestation, arterial blood gas analysis, mode of oxygenation, radiological imaging, and outcome were extracted from their medical records and compared pre- and post-TCZ infusion. Results: All patients of the study group had symptomatic presentations with a mean PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 205.41 before TCZ infusion. All patients had a raised IL-6 level (mean value 206.56 pg/mL) that was extremely elevated in 90% of patients. Infusion of TCZ dramatically reduced mean body temperature (100.78-99.32F) and the requirement for supplemental oxygen (68-48%) and improved mean SpO2 (86-89%) and mean P/F ratio (208-240) within 24 hours. Three patients on noninvasive ventilation were weaned off after TCZ infusion. Serum levels of IL-6 were raised initially but declined within 3-5 days of post-TCZ infusion. Conclusion: TCZ appears to be an effective therapeutic option in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients with raised IL-6 levels.

While involvement in recreational activities may support such transitions, further exploration of leisure experiences, as defined subjectively by newcomers themselves, is needed. Using an exploratory, community-based participatory approach drawing on photovoice methods, focus groups, and individual interviews, this research project explored the meanings of recreation among newcomers in two communities, one rural and one urban, in Eastern Canada. Forty newcomers (n = 40), originally from 13 different countries, participated in the photovoice activities. Transcripts from three focus groups and five individual interviews were analyzed, first by site to create the photo exhibits and then across sites. Across the two sites, four sub-themes were identified: (1) continuity with, and freedom from, past activities and places; (2) being in and connecting with nature; (3) staying physically and mentally well; and (4) connecting and learning with others through reciprocity. These all contributed to the overarching theme developing a sense of belonging: a series of small encounters. The findings highlight the powerful role of recreation within the resettlement process, and highlight particularly the importance of small, informal recreational experiences that are woven into everyday lives and routines. Such experiences contribute to a sense of belonging for newcomers, thus assisting the resettlement process.","output":"Picturing Recreation: Newcomers Perspectives on Experiences of Recreation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 is putting a massive strain on vulnerable healthcare system in low and middle-income countries like Bangladesh. Inequitable access to healthcare is further widened by the socio-economic gap and sense of insecurity during this pandemic. Self-medication is a common practice in Bangladesh as it provides a low-cost alternative for people, which involves inappropriate and injudicious use of medicines to treat self-recognized symptoms by the people. During the outbreak of COVID-19 in Dhaka city, the tendency of taking medicines by own decision was thought to be increased alarmingly due to unusual distress, caused by high self-awareness of their health and buying capacity of medication. Objectives: To observe the prevalence, pattern, sources and impact of self-medication practice among the respondents with high socio-economic standings and education. Setting: Citizens living in Dhaka city, Bangladesh during COVID-19 outbreak from April 2020 to May 2020. Method: Cross sectional online survey conducted on 626 citizens without having background of medical knowledge or related to any healthcare services (doctors, nurses, pharmacist, medical students) by structured questionnaires during COVID-19 outbreak. Outcome measures: Frequency of self-medication, commonly used antimicrobial agents, symptoms causing self-medication, sources of inspiration, relation with COVID-19 test results, economic burden involved in self-medication during outbreak. Results: : The prevalence of self-medication amid the outbreak of COVID-19 was 88.33% and only 179 (28.59%) took medication with doctors advice and remaining 447 (71.40%) respondents took the drugs as self-medication by other sources. The most frequently used anti-infective drugs during the outbreak were ivermectine (77.15%), azithromycin (54.15%), doxycycline (40.25%). The common symptoms were fever, throat pain, dry-cough and total 105 (16.77%) respondents took medications without having any symptoms. Almost 355 (85.33%) had taken medication without doing any test for COVID-19.

This paper proposes a summary of CCT contributions on extraordinary experiences and emphasizes the way these works have used the structural/anti-structural coexistence theory to depict the experiences consumers live through. Then it mobilizes a fiction to improve the understanding of escape.

These viruses are three different species belonging to Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus. Discovery of closely-related CoVs in bats indicates that bats are natural reservoirs of these viruses. How and when the bat CoVs cross-species barriers to infect humans are largely understudied. This article provides an overview of the distribution, genetic evolution and interspecies transmission of bat coronaviruses in China, particularly focusing on bat SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). Our studies showed that SARS-related CoVs are highly prevalent in horseshoe bats and some of them use the same receptor as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and have wide cell tissue tropism. However, these bat viruses seem to be low pathogenic in human ACE2 transgenic mice compared with the SARS-CoV-2. These results imply that these bat CoVs have potential interspecies transmission to other animals and humans. Our work highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emerging infectious diseases caused by these CoVs.","output":"[From SARS, MERS to COVID-19: a journey to understand bat coronaviruses]./ Du SRAS et du MERS  la COVID-19 : un voyage pour comprendre les coronavirus des chauves-souris*,*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We present examples of laboratory and remote studies, with a focus on studies appropriate for medical device design and evaluation. From this review and description of extant options for remote testing, we provide methods and tools to achieve research goals remotely. BACKGROUND: The FDA mandates human factors evaluation of medical devices. Studies show similarities and differences in results collected in laboratories compared to data collected remotely in non-laboratory settings. Remote studies show promise, though many of these are behavioral studies related to cognitive or experimental psychology. Remote usability studies are rare but increasing, as technologies allow for synchronous and asynchronous data collection. METHOD: We reviewed methods of remote evaluation of medical devices, from testing labels and instruction to usability testing and simulated use. Each method was coded for the attributes (e.g., supported media) that need consideration in usability studies. RESULTS: We present examples of how published usability studies of medical devices could be moved to remote data collection. We also present novel systems for creating such tests, such as the use of 3D printed or virtual prototypes. Finally, we advise on targeted participant recruitment. CONCLUSION: Remote testing will bring opportunities and challenges to the field of medical device testing. Current methods are adequate for most purposes, excepting the validation of Class III devices. APPLICATION: The tools we provide enable the remote evaluation of medical devices. Evaluations have specific research goals, and our framework of attributes helps to select or combine tools for valid testing of medical devices.","output":"Evaluating Medical Devices Remotely: Current Methods and Potential Innovations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Miscarriage is increasingly gaining recognition, both in scientific literature and media outlets, as a loss that has significant and lasting effects on parents, though often disenfranchised and overlooked by both personal support networks and healthcare providers. For both men and women, miscarriage can usher in intense grief, despair, and difficulty coping, and for women in particular, there is evidence of increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Additionally, miscarriage can contribute to decreased relationship satisfaction and increased risk of separation, all while stigma and disenfranchisement create a sense of isolation. Despite this increased need for support, research indicates that many parents experience their healthcare providers as dismissive of the significance of the loss and as primarily focusing only on the physical elements of care. Research exploring the barriers to providers engaging in more biopsychosocial-oriented care has identified time constraints, lack of resources, lack of training in addressing loss, and compassion fatigue as key areas for intervention. This paper will review the biopsychosocial elements of miscarriage and discuss a multidisciplinary, family-oriented approach that can be implemented in healthcare settings to ensure a high quality and holistic level of care for individuals, couples, and families experiencing pregnancy loss.","output":"A Multidisciplinary, Family-Oriented Approach to Caring for Parents After Miscarriage: The Integrated Behavioral Health Model of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter examines uncertainty in the expert advice on pandemics given to members of the general public.

Advancing understanding of this disease is crucial to further developing treatment and preventative care strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 2,546 COVID-19 pediatric patients (age  21 years) who were admitted the ICU in North America. Analysis of the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS) COVID-19 database was conducted between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2,546 COVID positive pediatric patients, 10.8% (n = 274) were diagnosed with AKI. Significantly higher continuous and categorical outcomes in the AKI subset compared to the non-AKI cohort included: length of stay at the hospital (LOS) [9.04 (5.11C16.66) vs. 5.09 (2.58C9.94) days], Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) 2 probability of death [1.20 (0.86C3.83) vs. 0.96 (0.79C1.72)], PIM 3 probability of death [0.98 (0.72C2.93) vs. 0.78 (0.69C1.26)], mortality [crude OR (95% CI): 5.01 (2.89C8.70)], airway and respiratory support [1.63 (1.27C2.10)], cardio-respiratory support [3.57 (1.55C8.23)], kidney support [12.52 (5.30C29.58)], and vascular access [4.84 (3.70C6.32)].

It has been observed that the antifungals are not as effective as they used to be. Aims: To determine the effectiveness of terbinafine and itraconazole in different doses and in combination in the treatment of tinea infection. Materials and Methods: Study design was a randomized parallel group trial. Patients were randomly divided into five parallel arms in which two of the standard drugs in recommended doses were compared with their double doses and with combination of both the drugs. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. Cure was considered as complete clinical resolution of the lesions. Fungal culture and sensitivity were done by disk diffusion method for all patients. Parametric one-way analysis of variance (F test) and Chi-square test were used for the analysis. Results: Two-hundred seventy-five patients were included in the study. Itraconazole containing groups showed significantly higher cure rates than terbinafine only groups both at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.001). Itraconazole containing groups, when compared against each other, were not found to be significantly different. The outcomes between terbinafine only groups were also not significantly different. Cure rates at 8 weeks were found to be greater than that at 4 weeks for all groups which were found to be highly significant (P < 0.001).

The production of extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL), AmpC and carbapenemases in Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is one such mechanism that currently poses a significant threat to the continuity of first-line and last-line -lactam agents, where multi-drug-resistant GNB currently warrant a pandemic on their own merit. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has long recognised the need for an improved and coordinated global effort to contain these pathogens, where two factors in particular, international travel and exposure to antimicrobials, play an important role in the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant genes. Studies described herein assess the resistance patterns of isolated nosocomial pathogens, where levels of resistance were detected using recognised in vitro methods. Additionally, studies conducted extensively investigated alternative biocide (namely peracetic acid, triameen and benzalkonium chloride) and therapeutic options (specifically 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione), where the levels of induced endotoxin from E. coli were also studied for the latter. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed there was a significant association between multi-drug resistance and ESBL production, where the WHO critical-priority pathogens, namely E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, exhibited among the greatest levels of multi-drug resistance. Novel compound 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (phendione) shows promising antimicrobial activity, with MICs determined for all bacterial species, where levels of induced endotoxin varied depending on the concentration used.

We carried out a telephone intervention for youth, recruited from DDUGKY (Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana), a central government funded skill development project in India. Methods: We performed an exploratory trial in Kerala, India, between 29 th July, 2020 and 26 th August, 2020 with pass out students of DDUGKY. From a total of 1036 students, 498 fulfilled the criteria and were recruited for the program. We randomized the participants via a computer generated randomization list. Out of 498 eligible participants, 251 were randomized to the intervention group and 247 to the general enquiry call group. Total of 439 (89%) participants, (251 (100%) = intervention arm and 188 (76%) = control arm), completed follow-up assessment after one month. The primary outcomes of the study included depression, measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and wellbeing, using WHO Wellbeing Index;while secondary outcomes included social support from friends and family. Results: Analysis was done for 439 pass out students who completed one-month intervention. Befriending intervention was effective in increasing the wellbeing (p=0.000) and social support (p=0.008) in the intervention group. Regression analysis revealed that befriending intervention is associated with notable changes in support from significant others (OR: 2.91, P=0.005), support from family (OR: 2.47, P=0.013) and support from friends (OR: 2.52, P=0.007).

Considering that these alterations may involve cells of the innate immune system and cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), we analysed the effect of LDV on natural killer (NK) cells. Within a few days of infection, a strong and transient NK cell activation, characterized by enhanced IFN-gamma message expression and cytolysis, was observed.

The majority of infected patients either traveled to Wuhan or came into contact with an infected person from Wuhan. Investigating members of the public with a travel history to Wuhan became the primary focus of the Chinese government's epidemic prevention and control measures, but several instances of withheld histories were uncovered as localized clusters of infections broke out. This study investigated the public's willingness and beliefs associated with reporting travel history to high-risk epidemic regions, to provide effective suggestions and measures for encouraging travel reporting. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted online between February 12 and 19, 2020. Descriptive analysis, chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test were used to identify socio-demographic factors and beliefs associated with reporting, as well as their impact on the willingness to report on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. RESULTS: Of the 1344 respondents, 91 (6.77%) expressed an inclination to deliberately withhold travel history. Those who understood the benefits of reporting and the legal consequences for deliberately withholding information, showed greater willingness to report their history (P < 0.05); conversely, those who believed reporting would stigmatize them and feared being quarantined after reporting showed less willingness to report (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As any incident of withheld history can have unpredictable outcomes, the proportion of people who deliberately withhold information deserves attention. Appropriate public risk communication and public advocacy strategies should be implemented to strengthen the understanding that reporting on travel history facilitates infection screening and prompt treatment, and to decrease the fear of potentially becoming quarantined after reporting. Additionally, social support and policies should be established, and measures should be taken to alleviate stigmatization and discrimination against potential patients and reporters of travel history. Reinforcing the legal accountability of withholding travel history and strengthening systematic community monitoring are the measures that China is currently taking to encourage reporting on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. These non-pharmaceutical interventions are relevant for countries that are currently facing the spread of the epidemic and those at risk of its potential spread.","output":"Willingness and beliefs associated with reporting travel history to high-risk coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic regions among the Chinese public: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is an innovative approach, progressively more applied in the academic and industrial context, to enhance hit identification for previously considered undruggable biological targets.

There has been substantial evidence supporting the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Airborne route has been considered as a major transmission pathway, which can spread the disease over a longer distance and time. The viral loads in the respiratory tract of a virus carrier are typically below 109 RNA copies/mL and are related to the emission rate of pathogens. Most particles expelled during respiratory activities are smaller than 1-2m in diameter. Viral aerosols can remain infectious for hours under typical indoor conditions. Sunlight contributes greatly to the viability inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks in different scenarios are reviewed based on existing data. Most outbreaks were related to long-term care facilities, K-12 schools, restaurants, retail facilities, and offices. The Wells-Riley model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission is introduced, along with model parameters such as the quanta generation rate, virus-containing particle size distribution, and inactivation rate. The effectiveness of various IAQ control strategies for mitigating the airborne transmission risk is analyzed, including PPE, ventilation strategies, partitions, air cleaning, and disinfection technologies, and occupancy control strategies. Both benefits and costs should be considered in designing the control strategies.

The studies performed so far are influenced, in most cases, by the treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, making it difficult to ascertain the burden of autoimmunity per se. For this reason, herein we assessed the susceptibility to COVID-19 in immunosuppressive drug-na?ve patients with autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune gastritis (AIG), celiac disease (CD), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Telephone interviews were conducted on 400 patients-100 for each group-in May 2021 by looking at the positivity of molecular nasopharyngeal swabs and/or serology for SARS-CoV-2, the need for hospitalization, the outcome, and the vaccination status. Overall, a positive COVID-19 test was reported in 33 patients (8.2%), comparable with that of the Lombardy general population (8.2%). In particular, seven patients with AIG, 9 with CD, 8 with T1D, and 9 with AITD experienced COVID-19. Only three patients required hospitalization, none died, and 235 (58.7%) were vaccinated, 43 with AIG, 47 with CD, 91 with T1D, and 54 with AITD. These results seem to suggest that autoimmunity per se does not increase the susceptibility to COVID-19. Also, COVID-19 seems to be mild in these patients, as indicated by the low hospitalization rates and adverse outcomes, although further studies are needed to better clarify this issue.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 in immunosuppressive drug-na?ve autoimmune disorders: Autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a common complication of congenital heart defects with left-to-right shunts. Current preclinical models do not reproduce clinical characteristics of shunt-related pulmonary hypertension. Aorto-caval shunt was firstly described as a model of right ventricle volume overload. The pathophysiology and the possible determination of pulmonary arterial hypertension of different periods of shunt exposure are still undefined. A method to create standardized, reproducible aorto-caval shunt was developed in growing rats (26040 g). Three groups of animals were considered: shunt exposure for 10 weeks, shunt exposure for 20 weeks and control (sham laparotomy). Echocardiography and magnetic resonance revealed increased right ventricular end diastolic area in shunt at 10 weeks compared to control. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated increased right ventricular afterload and increased effective pulmonary arterial elastance (Ea) in shunt at 20 weeks compared to control (1.290.20 vs. 0.140.06 mmHg/l, p=0.004). At the same time point, the maximal slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees) decreased (0.50.2 mmHg/ml vs. 1.20.3, p<0.001). Consequently, right ventricular-arterial coupling was markedly deteriorated with a 50% decrease in the ratio of end-systolic to pulmonary artery elastance (Ees/Ea). Finally, left ventricular preload diminished (30% decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume). Histology demonstrated medial hypertrophy and small artery luminal narrowing. Chronic exposure to aorto-caval shunt is a reliable model to produce right ventricular volume overload and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In some of the viruses, proteases are experimentally reported to be a potential target of HCQ. However, no in-depth investigations are available in the literature yet.

Our analysis found that HCQ binds within the catalytic pocket of Mpro and remains stable upto one-third of simulation time but further causes increased fluctuations in simulation parameters. In the end, the HCQ does not possess any pre-formed hydrogen bond, other non-covalent interactions with Mpro, ultimately showing the unsteadiness in binding at catalytic binding pocket and may suggest that HCQ may not inhibit the Mpro.

PURPOSE: To review the MRI findings associated with acute neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between March 23 and May 7, 2020 at the Piti-Salptrire University Hospital, a reference center for COVID-19 in the Paris area. Inclusion criteria were: adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, presenting with acute neurological manifestations and referred for a brain MRI examination. Patients were excluded if they had a previous history of neurological disease. The characteristics and the frequency of different MRI features were investigated. The findings were analyzed separately in patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other departments (non-ICU). RESULTS: During the inclusion period, 1176 consecutive patients were hospitalized for suspected COVID-19. Out of 308 patients with acute neurological symptoms, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria (23.7%) and were included: 35 ICU patients (47.9%) and 38 non-ICU patients (52.1%). The mean age was 58.5  15.6 years, with a male predominance (65.8% vs. 34.2%).

The prevalence of STB and associated risk factors were estimated in multivariable models with individual-level and society-level measures of association. We used post-stratification weights to make the data representative for the entire clinical workforce in Belgium. RESULTS: Prevalence was 3.6% death wish, 1.5% suicide ideation, 1.0% suicide plan, and 0.0% suicide attempt. Thirty-day STB was (a) increased among respondents with lifetime and current mental disorders (mostly depression) and those hospitalized for COVID19 infection, (b) decreased among respondents with social support, and (c) unrelated to work environment.

Although immunomodulatory mechanisms vary among viruses, the activation of multiple TLRs that occurs primarily through the recruitment of adapter proteins such as MyD88 and TRIF contributes to the induction of a cytokine storm. Based on this, controlling the robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages may be applicable as a cellular approach to investigate potential cytokine-targeted therapies against COVID-19. In the current study, we utilized TLR2/MyD88 and TLR3/TRIF co-activated macrophages and evaluated the anti-cytokine storm effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Babaodan (BBD). An RNA-seq-based transcriptomic approach was used to determine the molecular mode of action. Additionally, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of BBD in vivo using a mouse model of post-viral bacterial infection-induced pneumonia and seven severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our study reveals the protective role of BBD against excessive immune responses in macrophages, where the underlying mechanisms involve the inhibition of the NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways. In vivo, BBD significantly inhibited the release of IL-6, thus resulting in increased survival rates in mice. Based on limited data, we demonstrated that severely ill COVID-19 patients benefited from BBD treatment due to a reduction in the overproduction of IL-6.

A total of 27 patients with COVID\\\\19-related pneumonia, without need for intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation at hospital presentation, and 24 controls with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively included. ETP levels were measured on admission. Patients were evaluated for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism) and bleeding complications [according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition] during in-hospital stay. COVID-19 patients had similar ETP levels compared to controls (AUC 93  24% vs 99  21%, p = 0.339). In the COVID-19 cohort, patients with in-hospital MACE showed lower ETP levels on admission vs those without (AUC 86  14% vs 95  27%, p = 0.041), whereas ETP values were comparable in patients with or without bleeding (AUC 82  16% vs 95  26%, p = 0.337). An interaction between age and ETP levels for both MACE and bleeding complications was observed, where a younger age was associated with an inverse relationship between ETP values and adverse event risk (p(int) 0.018 for MACE and 0.050 for bleeding). Patients with COVID-19 have similar thrombin potential on admission compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this rapid review, we identified country classification schemes for high-risk COVID-19 areas and associated policies which mirrored the dynamic situation in 2020, with the aim of identifying any patterns that could indicate the effectiveness of such policies. We searched academic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, medRxiv, Google Scholar, and EMBASE. We also consulted web pages of the relevant government institutions in all countries. This rapid review's searches were conducted between October 2020 and December 2021. Web scraping of policy documents yielded additional 43 country reports on high-risk area classification schemes. In 43 countries from which relevant reports were identified, six issued domestic classification schemes. International classification schemes were issued by the remaining 38 countries, and these mainly used case incidence per 100,000 inhabitants as key indicator. The case incidence cut-off also varied across the countries, ranging from 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 7 days to more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 28 days. The criteria used for defining high-risk areas varied across countries, including case count, positivity rate, composite risk scores, community transmission and satisfactory laboratory testing. Countries either used case incidence in the past 7, 14 or 28 days. The resulting policies included restrictions on internal movement and international travel.

Our aim was to describe the perceptions and experiences of a sample of nursing students during the early stages of the outbreak. We conducted a qualitative study with an empirical-phenomenological approach. Twenty nursing students in their final year of study in Spain were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in in-depth interviews between 20 April and 10 May 2020. The interviews were transcribed and then analyzed using Haases adaptation of Colaizzis phenomenological method. Four main themes emerged from data analysis: social responsibility and pride as a health worker, pressure caused by working with COVID-19 patients, feeling defenseless and let down, and personal growth as a health worker. These main themes were further divided into 11 theme categories. Due to an intense work day for several days in a row, the students were tired and mentally exhausted. Even so, they managed to overcome any difficulties, demonstrating their professional dedication and resilience. Greater preparatory support should be provided to safeguard the well-being of these future healthcare providers. More intensive preparatory training is necessary for health sciences students to facilitate crisis preparedness and effective crisis management. It is necessary to implement support from healthcare systems, including sufficient personal protective equipment, as well as contracts that accurately reflect the work they do.

METHODS A total of 115 patients with LN (research group) admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University during January 2018 and January 2021 and 60 healthy controls (control group) who concurrently underwent physical examination were included in this study. Peripheral blood NLR and LMR were recorded in both arms. According to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at admission, patients with LN were assigned to a normal renal function group and a renal insufficiency group to compare their NLR and LMR values. Further, the cases were divided into good and poor prognosis groups based on the follow-up results, and the NLR and LMR were observed. Pearson test was used to analyze the relationship between NLR, LMR, and eGFR. Independent risk factors for poor prognosis of renal function were analyzed by multivariate logistic analysis. RESULTS The cases showed higher NLR and lower LMR than the controls (P<0.001). The NLR was lower in patients with normal renal function than in those with renal insufficiency (P<0.001). Patients with poor prognosis presented with significantly higher NLR and lower LMR than those with good prognosis (P<0.001). In cases, eGFR decreased with the increase of NLR, presenting an inverse association (r=-0.572, P<0.001). eGFR increased as the LMR increased, showing a positive correlation (r=0.582, P<0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis identified that infection, hypoproteinemia, moderate or above lupus disease activity, high NLR, and low LMR were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in LN.

Even mild insufficiencies of Zn cause alterations in haematopoiesis and immune functions, resulting in a proinflammatory phenotype and a disturbed redox metabolism. Although immune system malfunction has the most obvious effect, the functions of several tissue cell types are disturbed if Zn supply is limiting. Adhesion molecules and tight junction proteins decrease, while cell death increases, generating barrier dysfunction and possibly organ failure. Taken together, Zn deficiency both weakens the resistance of the human body towards pathogens and at the same time increases the danger of an overactive immune response that may cause tissue damage.

METHODS: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data, which has one of the largest known global COVID-19 database. We included patients with chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (aNMD) [myasthenia gravis (MG), inflammatory myositis, and chronic inflammatory neuropathies (CIN)] and MS, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) coding for one year before January 20th, 2020. We examined the use of IST, rate of COVID- 19, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality among the patients with aNMD and MS. RESULTS: A total of 33,451 patients with aNMD and 42,899 patients with MS were included. Among them, 111 (0.33%) patients with aNMD and 115 patients (0.27%) with MS had COVID-19. About one third of them required hospitalization. IST did not appear to have a significant impact on overall infection risk in either group; however, risk of hospitalization for immunosuppressed patients with aNMD was higher (Odds ratio 2.86, p-value 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: IST use does not appear to make patients with aNMD and MS more vulnerable to COVID-19. IST may be continued during the pandemic, as previously suggested by expert opinion guidelines.

Methods : A quantitative study is conducted in China based on the multi-source spatial data of 315 Chinese cities. Firstly, the spatial discrepancy of COVID-19 transmission was examined based on spatial autocorrelation analysis and hot pot analysis. Next, a comprehensive indicator framework was established by including a wide range of factors such as human mobility, geographical features, public health measures and residents' awareness. Finally, multivariate regression models employing the variables were constructed to identify the determinants of Covid-19 transmission. Results : Significant spatial discrepancy of transmission was proved and ten determinants were identified. Conclusions : The transmission consequence (measured by number of cumulative cases) was mostly correlated with the migration scale from Wuhan, followed by socio-economic factors. Transmission duration (measured by the time from the first to last case within the city) was mostly determined by total migration scale and lockdown speed, which suggests that timely implementation of public health measures facilitated fast control of transmission.

Analyses of efficiency were not pursued because of variation in reporting the length of stay (n=12 trials). Narrow-bore chest tube (<14 F) had the highest likelihood of top ranking in terms of immediate success (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=64%). Needle aspiration had the highest likelihood of top ranking in terms of safety (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=95.8%). CONCLUSION In the initial management of nontension spontaneous pneumothorax, the optimal strategy between the choices of a narrow-bore chest tube (<14 F, top ranked in efficacy) and needle aspiration (top ranked in safety) is unclear. Complications were more common in large-bore chest tube (14 F, including 14-F tube) insertions compared with needle aspiration.","output":"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions in Initial Management of Spontaneous Pneumothorax: A Systematic Review and a Bayesian Network Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]local initiatives have emerged to organize social assistance for the more impoverished members of society.

Currently, our facility uses the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) bronchodilator with Venturi mask modified spacer (VMMS) in patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) for mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to assess the outcomes and acceptance of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI-VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI-VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs. The direct discharge rate was similar for both nebulizer (n = 2162, 92.5%) and pMDI-VMMS method (n = 768, 90.7%) (p-value = 0.120). Twenty-eight patients (27.2%) favoured the pMDI-VMMS over the nebulizer, whereas 36 patients (35.0%) had no preference for either method. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) felt that the current pMDI-VMMS method was better or at least as effective in relieving their symptoms as a nebulizer. The current method was favoured over the nebulizer by twenty-seven AMOs (84.4%). Twenty-eight (87.5%) AMOs suggested that the current method was more effective than the nebulizer. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The bronchodilator delivered via pMDI-VMMS appeared to be comparable to nebulizer in treating mild to moderate asthma and COPD exacerbations in the outpatient ED. Most patients and AMOs accepted the use of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Venturi mask modified spacer can be a cheap and effective alternative to the commercial spacer in a resource-limited situation.","output":"The outcomes and acceptance of pressurized metered-dose inhaler bronchodilators with venturi mask modified spacer in the outpatient emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding how human ACE2 genetic variants differ in their recognition by SARS-CoV-2 can facilitate the leveraging of ACE2 as an axis for treating and preventing COVID-19.

A similar entity in newborns, known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Newborns (MIS-N), is also described. However, the epidemiology, case definition, clinical presentations, and outcomes of MIS-N are still being updated. The presence of SARS CoV 2 antibodies in both the mother and the neonate suggests transplacental transfer of IgG antibodies causing cytokine storm and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in newborns (MIS-N). Aims and Objectives: To investigate the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, outcomes, and treatment modalities of neonates with multisystem inflammatory syndrome due to transplacental transfer of SARS CoV 2 antibodies. Materials and Methods: The study included eighteen consecutive neonates who met the MIS-C criteria. Following prior ethical clearance and consent from parents or guardians, socio-demographic data, lab parameters, clinical parameters, and treatment given were documented, tabulated, and analysed. Results: All of the 18 neonates had fever. The most common system involved was the respiratory system (15/18), followed by the cardiovascular system with coronary artery dilatations (10/18) and persistent pulmonary hypertension (4/18). All 17 cases (17/18) responded favourably to intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gm/kg) and intravenous dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg). D-Dimers decreased significantly after treatment, with a p value of 0.01. One case with more than three systems involved (respiratory, CVS, CNS, and renal involvement) (1/18) resulted in death. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates, especially with fever, multisystem involvement and positive SARS CoV 2 antibodies. Fever may be a soft pointer to the diagnosis as fever is rare in neonates with other illnesses. Followup antibody titres are needed to document if there is any relationship between level of antibodies and disease.

However, medical information regarding the urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients is limited or unknown. OBJECTIVES To comprehensively evaluate urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Men aged between 20 years and 50 years who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovered when the study was conducted were enrolled in our study. Demographic, clinical characteristics and history of hospitalization were collected and analyzed. Urine, expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) and semen samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Semen quality and hormonal profiles were analyzed. RESULTS Among 74 male recovered COVID-19 patients, 11 (14.9%) were asymptomatic, classified into mild type, and 31 (41.9%) were classified into moderate type. The remaining patients (32/74, 43.2%) had severe pneumonia. No critically ill recovered COVID-19 patient was recruited in our cohort. The median interval between last positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test and semen samples collection was 80 days (IQR, 64-93). The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-36; range, 21-49) and the median body mass index (BMI) was 24.40 (IQR, 22.55-27.30). Forty-five (61.6%) men were married, and 28 (38.4%) were unmarried. Fifty-three (72.6%) patients denied cigarette smoking, 18 (24.7%) were active smokers, and 2 of them were past smokers. The majority of our participants (53/74, 72.6%) did not consume alcohol. Fever occurred in most of the patients (75.3%) and 63 of them had abnormal chest CT images. Only one patient complained of scrotal discomfort during the course of COVID-19, which was ruled out orchitis by MRI (data not shown). A total of 205 samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection (74 urine samples, 70 semen samples and 61 EPS samples). However, viral nucleic acid was not detected in body fluids from the urogenital system. In terms of hormonal profiles, levels of FSH, LH, testosterone and estradiol were 5.20 [4.23] mIU/mL, 3.95 [1.63] mIU/mL, 3.65 [1.19] ng/mL, 39.48 [12.51] pg/mL, respectively. And these values were within the normal limits. The overall semen quality of recovered COVID-19 patients was above the lower reference limit released by the WHO. While compared with healthy-control, sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motility were significantly declined. In addition, different clinical types of COVID-19 have no significant difference in semen parameters, but total sperm count showed a descending trend. Interestingly, subjects with a longer recovery time showed worse data for sperm quality. Small sample size and lacking semen parameters before the infection are the major limitations of our study. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest cohort study with longest follow-up for urogenital evaluation comprehensively so far. Direct urogenital involvement was not found in the recovered COVID-19 male patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was undetectable in the urogenital secretions, and semen quality declined slightly while hormonal profiles remained normal. Moreover, patients with a long time ( 90 days) since recovery had lower total sperm count. Great attention and further study should be conducted and follow up on the reproductive function in the following months.","output":"No Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Urine, Expressed Prostatic Secretions and Semen in 74 Recovered COVID-19 Male Patients: A Perspective and Urogenital Evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the COVID-19 epidemics in 14 land-bordering countries of China, evaluate the risk of imported cases to China, and provide evidence for the further prevention of imported COVID-19","output":"Assessment for the COVID-19 outbreak situation and importation risk of the 14 land-bordering countries of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To highlight the need for the development of effective and realistic workforce strategies for critical care nurses, in both a steady state and pandemic. BACKGROUND: In acute care settings, there is an inverse relationship between nurse staffing and iatrogenesis, including mortality. Despite this, there remains a lack of consensus on how to determine safe staffing levels. Intensive care units (ICU) provide highly specialised complex healthcare treatments. In developed countries, mortality rates in the ICU setting are high and significantly varied after adjustment for diagnosis. The variability has been attributed to systems, patient and provider issues including the workload of critical care nurses. DESIGN: Discursive paper. FINDINGS: Nursing workforce is the single most influential mediating variable on ICU patient outcomes. Numerous systematic reviews have been undertaken in an effort to quantify the effect of critical care nurses on mortality and morbidity, invariably leading to the conclusion that the association is similar to that reported in acute care studies. This is a consequence of methodological limitations, inconsistent operational definitions and variability in endpoint measures. We evaluated the impact inadequate measurement has had on capturing relevant critical care data, and we argue for the need to develop effective and realistic ICU workforce measures. CONCLUSION: COVID\\\\19 has placed an unprecedented demand on providing health care in the ICU. Mortality associated with ICU admission has been startling during the pandemic. While ICU systems have largely remained static, the context in which care is provided is profoundly dynamic and the role and impact of the critical care nurse needs to be measured accordingly. Often, nurses are passive recipients of unplanned and under\\\\resourced changes to workload, and this has been brought into stark visibility with the current COVID\\\\19 situation. Unless critical care nurses are engaged in systems management, achieving consistently optimal ICU patient outcomes will remain elusive. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Objective measures commonly fail to capture the complexity of the critical care nurses role despite evidence to indicate that as workload increases so does risk of patient mortality, job stress and attrition. Critical care nurses must lead system change to develop and evaluate valid and reliable workforce measures.","output":"Workforce management and patient outcomes in the intensive care unit during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and beyond: a discursive paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: From November 2018 through February 2019, person-to-person transmission of Andes virus (ANDV) hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in Chubut Province, Argentina, and resulted in 34 confirmed infections and 11 deaths. Understanding the genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of person-to-person transmission of ANDV is crucial to designing effective interventions. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiologic information was obtained by means of patient report and from public health centers. Serologic testing, contact-tracing, and next-generation sequencing were used to identify ANDV infection as the cause of this outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and to reconstruct person-to-person transmission events. RESULTS: After a single introduction of ANDV from a rodent reservoir into the human population, transmission was driven by 3 symptomatic persons who attended crowded social events. After 18 cases were confirmed, public health officials enforced isolation of persons with confirmed cases and self-quarantine of possible contacts; these measures most likely curtailed further spread. The median reproductive number (the number of secondary cases caused by an infected person during the infectious period) was 2.12 before the control measures were enforced and decreased to 0.96 after the measures were implemented. Full genome sequencing of the ANDV strain involved in this outbreak was performed with specimens from 27 patients and showed that the strain that was present (Epuyn/18-19) was similar to the causative strain (Epilink/96) in the first known person-to-person transmission of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by ANDV, which occurred in El Bolsn, Argentina, in 1996. Clinical investigations involving patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this outbreak revealed that patients with a high viral load and liver injury were more likely than other patients to spread infection. Disease severity, genomic diversity, age, and time spent in the hospital had no clear association with secondary transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, high viral titers in combination with attendance at massive social gatherings or extensive contact among persons were associated with a higher likelihood of transmission.

Trauma and orthopaedic units have cancelled elective surgery, moved to virtual based clinics and have been forced to reconsider the provision of trauma. Our national elective orthopaedic centre has been re-designated as a trauma centre to allow tertiary centres re-direct triaged trauma. Many governments, as part of their COVID-19 management, have significantly restricted activity of the general population. We proposed that trauma patterns would change alongside these changes and maintaining existing standards of treatment would require dedicated planning and structures. Methods Referrals over a six-week period (March 15th C April 30th) were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected directly from our referral database and a database populated. Analysis was performed to assess trauma volume, aetiology, and changes in trends. Results There were one hundred and fifty-nine referrals from three individual hospitals within the timeframe. Mean age of patients referred was 55 (range17-92). Males accounted for 45% of cases. F&A injuries were the most common (32%), followed by H&W (28%), UL (17%), H&F (16%) and K&T (7%). In comparison to the corresponding time-period in 2019, trauma theatre activity reduced by almost one half (45.3%) Conclusion The majority of trauma referred to our Dublin based centre during COVID-19 related population restrictions appears to be home based and trauma volumes have decreased.

BACKGROUND Increasing evidence shows that neurotropism is a common feature of Coronaviruses (CoVs). Like the other CoVs, SARS-CoV 2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The brain is thought to express ACE2 receptors detected on glial cells and neurons. There are also ACE2 receptors in skeletal muscles. Our study aimed to investigate neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and contribute to this area of limited knowledge. METHODS A total of 51 patients, presented to hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were included in the study. The diagnosis of all patients included in the study was made according to the WHO interim guideline. The patients were divided into two subgroups as mild and severe course according to the severity of the disease. RESULTS Neurological symptoms were detected in 16 (31.37 %) patients. Muscle injury was detected in 10 (19.61 %) patients. The most common neurological symptom was headache (n: 9, 17.65 %). When the frequency of all neurological symptoms was compared in those with severe and mild disease, no significant differences were found between the groups. When the frequency of muscular involvement was compared in patients with severe and mild course, no significant differences were found between the groups. CONCLUSION The nervous system and skeletal muscle system may be among viral targets. Detection of some neurological findings may be valuable in predicting the course of the disease.

Its adverse outcomes not only affect health-care providers' health, but also extend to their patients, resulting in bad-quality care. The COVID-19 pandemic puts frontline health-care providers at greater risk of psychological stress and burnout syndrome. OBJECTIVES: this study aimed to identify the levels of burnout among health-care professionals currently working at Assiut University hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: the current study adopted an online cross-sectional design using the SurveyMonkey? website for data collection. A total of 201 physicians were included and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scale was used to assess the three burnout syndrome dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. RESULTS: about one-third, two-thirds, and one-quarter of the respondents had high emotional exhaustion, high depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment, respectively. Younger, resident, and single physicians reported higher burnout scores. The personal accomplishment score was significantly higher among males. Those working more than eight hours/day and dealing with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher scores. CONCLUSION: during the COVID-19 pandemic, a high prevalence of burnout was recorded among physicians. Age, job title, working duration, and working hours/day were significant predictors for burnout syndrome subscale results.

Employers are the most common source of health insurance among nonelderly adults. Thus, job loss may lead to a loss of health insurance and reduce access to cancer screening. This study examined associations between unemployment, health insurance, and cancer screening to inform the pandemic's potential impacts on early cancer detection. METHODS: Up\\\\to\\\\date and past\\\\year breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening prevalences were computed for nonelderly respondents (aged <65 years) with 2000\\\\2018 National Health Interview Survey data. Multivariable logistic regression models with marginal probabilities were used to estimate unemployed\\\\versus\\\\employed unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Unemployed adults (2000\\\\2018) were 4 times more likely to lack insurance than employed adults (41.4% vs 10.0%; P < .001). Unemployed adults had a significantly lower up\\\\to\\\\date prevalence of screening for cervical cancer (78.5% vs 86.2%; P < .001), breast cancer (67.8% vs 77.5%; P < .001), colorectal cancer (41.9 vs 48.5%; P < .001), and prostate cancer (25.4% vs 36.4%; P < .001). These differences were eliminated after accounting for health insurance coverage.

The purpose of our work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the different sampling methods in the hospital setting to assess their correlation with the structural, functional, and operational situation of the monitored departments and to define the dynamics of the spread of the virus in indoor environments. METHODS: The monitoring was carried out at the San Martino Polyclinic Hospital (Genoa, Italy) in the period from April 2020 to June 2021. The presence of viral RNA in the collected samples was evaluated by qPCR. The infection capacity of the sample collected was also evaluated by an in vitro challenge test on cells sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The percentage of positivity with respect to the number of tests performed (sensitivity) were bubbler 50%, wipe test 17%, and challenge test 11%. Only 20% of the samples tested positive in the wipe test and 43% of the samples tested positive in the bubbler sampling were also positive in the challenge test. All the positivity obtained was detected at a distance of less than 2 m and height of less than 1.5 from COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental contamination from SARS-CoV-2 detected at the San Martino Polyclinic Hospital is found lower than similar assessments performed in other hospitals both in Italy and abroad. Our study predicted that environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 must be carried out in an integrated way by not using a single sampling method, as each individual test has a different biological significance and performance.

METHODS: Data regarding 248 consecutive patients with carcinoma who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected retrospectively from 33 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, from January 1, 2020, to March 25, 2020. The follow-up cutoff date was July 22, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with a higher risk of death. RESULTS: Of the 248 patients enrolled, the median age was 63 years and 128 patients (52%) were male. On admission, 147 patients (59%) did not undergo recent oncologic treatment, whereas 32 patients (13%), 25 patients (10%), 12 patients (5%), and 10 patients (4%), respectively, underwent chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy. At the time of last follow-up, 51 patients (21%) were critically ill during hospitalization, 40 of whom had died. Compared with patients without receipt of recent oncologic treatment, the mortality rate of patients who recently received oncologic treatment was significantly higher (24.8% vs 10.2%; hazard ratio, 2.010 [95% CI, 1.079-3.747; P = .027]).

METHODS An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an open, two-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in several hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomised into either SH or TH surgery between January 2011 and August 2014 and were followed up for 24 months. Intervention and subsequent resource use data were collected using case review forms and questionnaires. Benefits were collected using the EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL-five dimensions-three levels) instrument. The primary economic outcome was incremental cost measured in pounds (), year 2016 values, relative to the incremental benefit, which was estimated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost and benefits accrued in the second year were discounted at 3.5%. The base-case analysis was based on imputed data. Uncertainty was explored using univariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Participants (n = 777) were randomised to SH (n = 389) or TH (n = 388). The mean cost of SH was 337 (95% confidence interval [CI] 251-423) higher than that of TH and the mean QALYs were -0.070 (95% CI -0.127 to -0.011) lower than for TH. The base-case cost-utility analysis indicated that SH has zero probability of being cost effective at both the 20,000 and the 30,000 threshold. Results from the sensitivity analyses were similar to those from the base-case analysis. CONCLUSIONS The evidence suggests that, on average, the total mean costs over the 24-month follow-up period were significantly higher for the SH arm than for the TH arm. The QALYs were also, on average, significantly lower for the SH arm. These results were supported by the sensitivity analyses.

For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]) were determined from serum samples (n = 246) from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau, and then in some cases a gradual decline at later time points after 40 days after symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau, and then remains constant up to 8 months postinfection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Label-Free Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test and a Longitudinal Study of Antibody Characteristics in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a tool of fundamental importance in structural biology, helping us understand the basic building blocks of life.

Existing reconstruction algorithms, however, cannot easily keep pace with the rapidly growing size of cryo-EM datasets due to their high computational and memory cost. We introduce cryoAI, an ab initio reconstruction algorithm for homogeneous conformations that uses direct gradient-based optimization of particle poses and the electron scattering potential from single-particle cryo-EM data.

However, over time this view evolved and it is now clear that CNS tissue is neither immunologically inert nor privileged, rather, its immune response is exquisitely sensitive to antigenic challenge. Indeed, overwhelming evidence now indicates that upon microbial infection of the CNS there is often a dynamic and orchestrated localized immune response that culminates with infiltration of antigen-specific lymphocytes, usually resulting in control and elimination of the invading pathogen. It is important to note that not all effective immune responses originating in the CNS are completely beneficial to the host; alternatively, there are instances where immune cell infiltration following infection is associated with severe neuropathology resulting in death or chronic neurodegenerative disease.","output":"The Usual Suspects: Chemokines and Microbial Infection of the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EDITORIAL.","output":"COVID-19 AND TUBERCULOSIS ARE STILL WITH US."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively).

These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty.

To further optimise the forage use, this study focused on understanding forage digestibility in the two most important cuts of perennial ryegrass, the spring cut at heading and the autumn cut. In a highly diverse collection of 592 Lolium perenne genotypes, the organic matter digestibility (OMD) and underlying traits such as cell wall digestibility (NDFD) and cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) were investigated for 2 years. A high genotype  season interaction was found for OMD and NDFD, indicating differences in genetic control of these forage quality traits in spring versus autumn. OMD could be explained by both the quantity of cell wall content (NDF) and the quality of the cell wall content (NDFD). The variability in NDFD in spring was mainly explained by differences in hemicellulose. A 1% increase of the hemicellulose content in the cell wall (HC.NDF) resulted in an increase of 0.81% of NDFD. In autumn, it was mainly explained by the lignin content in the cell wall (ADL.NDF). A 0.1% decrease of ADL.NDF resulted in an increase of 0.41% of NDFD. The seasonal traits were highly heritable and showed a higher variation in autumn versus spring, indicating the potential to select for forage quality in the autumn cut. In a candidate gene association mapping approach, in which 503 genes involved in cell wall biogenesis, plant architecture, and phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling, identified significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) which could explain from 29 to 52% of the phenotypic variance in the forage quality traits OMD and NDFD, with small effects of each marker taken individually (ranging from 1 to 7%). No identical QTLs were identified between seasons, but within a season, some QTLs were in common between digestibility traits and cell wall composition traits confirming the importance of hemicellulose concentration for spring digestibility and lignin concentration in NDF for autumn digestibility.","output":"Seasonal Differences in Structural and Genetic Control of Digestibility in Perennial Ryegrass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations is the main driver of global warming due to fossil fuel combustion.

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. CONCLUSIONS: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns accounting for antibody-dependent enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support has a high incidence of both bleeding and thrombotic complications. Despite clear differences in patient characteristics and pathologies between veno-venous (VV) and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO support, anticoagulation practices are often the same across modalities. Moreover, there is very little data on their respective coagulation profiles and comparisons of thrombin generation in these patients. This study compares the coagulation profile and thrombin generation between patients supported with either VV and VA ECMO. A prospective cohort study of patients undergoing VA and VV ECMO at an Intensive care department of a university hospital and ECMO referral centre. In addition to routine coagulation testing and heparin monitoring per unit protocol, thromboelastography (TEG), multiplate aggregometry (MEA), calibrated automated thrombinography (CAT) and von-Willebrands activity (antigen and activity ratio) were sampled second-daily for 1 week, then weekly thereafter. VA patients had significantly lower platelets counts, fibrinogen, anti-thrombin and clot strength with higher d-dimer levels than VV patients, consistent with a more pronounced consumptive coagulopathy. Thrombin generation was higher in VA than VV patients, and the heparin dose required to suppress thrombin generation was lower in VA patients. There were no significant differences in total bleeding or thrombotic event rates between VV and VA patients when adjusted for days on extracorporeal support. VA patients received a lower median daily heparin dose 8500 IU [IQR 2500C24000] versus VV 28,800 IU [IQR 17,300C40,800.00]; < 0.001. Twenty-eight patients (72%) survived to hospital discharge; comprising 53% of VA patients and 77% of VV patients. Significant differences between the coagulation profiles of VA and VV patients exist, and anticoagulation strategies for patients of these modalities should be different. Further research into the development of tailored anticoagulation strategies that include the mode of ECMO support need to be completed.","output":"Hemostasis, coagulation and thrombin in venoarterial and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: the HECTIC study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional medicine is becoming a primary source of health care in many countries in recent years The current study proposes a new dimension of understanding a traditional origin treatment, using herbo-mineral preparations in nanoform The herbo-mineral preparation, Linga chenduram [HMLC], was prepared according to the ancient palm script protocol dates back to 1000 years In search of alternative therapy for the coronavirus, an attempt was made to determine this ethnic medicine formulation's therapeutic potential for viral hepatitis infection The Hepatitis C virus [HCV] has several genomic similarities with SARS-CoV-2 viruses The herbo-mineral formulation (HMLC) were analyzed using UVCvis, EDAX, FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TEM studies SEM images confirmed the ' presence of nanoparticles with agglomerated conditions having an average grain size of 18 to 25 nm EDAX studies showed the presence of metallic components in oxide or sulfide form in HMLC The HCV inhibitory effects of HMLC indicated a good response The cytotoxicity of this preparation against the Huh-7 human hepatoma cell line was significant The HMLC showed a strong inhibitory effect on HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner The genomic component of HCV is similar to COVID ?19 virus The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease has a striking three-dimensional structural similarity to the SARS-CoV2 Mpro protease, particularly in the arrangement of key active site residues So HMLC can be tried to treat coronavirus infection At higher concentrations, HMLC exhibited over 100-fold inhibition In the MTT assay, HMLC did not show any apparent cytotoxic effect on cell viability at the concentrations 1C100 g Histological studies indicated that the liver and kidney did not experience any toxicity by 7 and 15 consecutive days of administration of HMLC on experimental Wistar rats Hence, the HMLC can be tried as a therapy for COVID ?19 infections using the preparations strictly according to ethnopharmacological protocol and optimum doses ? 2020 The Author(s)","output":"Nano-formulation of herbo-mineral alternative medicine from linga chenduram and evaluation of antiviral efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to introduce a special issue on boundary organising in healthcare bringing together a selection of six leading papers accepted for presentation at the 12th Organisational Behaviour in Health Care (OBHC 2020) Conference Design/methodology/approachIn this introductory paper, the guest editors position the special issue papers in relation to the theoretical literature on boundaries and boundary organising and highlight how these contributions advance our understanding of boundary phenomena in healthcare FindingsThree strands of thinking C practice-based, systems theory and place-based approaches C are briefly described, followed by an analytical summary of the six papers included in the special issue The papers illustrate how the dynamic processes of boundary organising, stemming from the dual nature of boundaries and boundary objects, can be constrained and enabled by the complexity of broader multi-layered boundary landscapes, in which local clinical and managerial practices are embedded Originality/valueThe authors set the scene for the papers included in the special issue, summarise their contributions and implications, and suggest directions for future research Research implications/limitationsThe authors call for interdisciplinary and multi-theoretical investigations of boundary phenomena in health organisation and management, with a particular attention to (1) the interplay between multiple types of boundaries, actors and objects operating in complex multi-layered boundary systems;(2) diversity of the backgrounds, experiences and preferences of patients and services users and (3) the role of artificial intelligence and other non-human actors in boundary organising Practical implicationsDeveloping strategies of reflection, mitigation, justification and relational work is crucial for the success of boundary organising initiatives","output":"Boundary organising in healthcare: theoretical perspectives, empirical insights and future prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune defense is a potent antiviral mechanism.

We evaluate the ability of a deep learning neural network (DNN) to predict hemostasis control ability using the first minute of surgical video and compare model performance with human experts viewing the same video. Methods: The publicly available SOCAL dataset contains 147 videos of attending and resident surgeons managing hemorrhage in a validated, high-fidelity cadaveric simulator. Videos are labeled with outcome and blood loss (mL). The first minute of 20 videos was shown to four, blinded, fellowship trained skull-base neurosurgery instructors, and to SOCALNet (a DNN trained on SOCAL videos). SOCALNet architecture included a convolutional network (ResNet) identifying spatial features and a recurrent network identifying temporal features (LSTM). Experts independently assessed surgeon skill, predicted outcome and blood loss (mL). Outcome and blood loss predictions were compared with SOCALNet. Results: Expert inter-rater reliability was 0.95. Experts correctly predicted 14/20 trials (Sensitivity: 82%, Specificity: 55%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV): 69%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV): 71%). SOCALNet correctly predicted 17/20 trials (Sensitivity 100%, Specificity 66%, PPV 79%, NPV 100%) and correctly identified all successful attempts. Expert predictions of the highest and lowest skill surgeons and expert predictions reported with maximum confidence were more accurate. Experts systematically underestimated blood loss (mean error -131 mL, RMSE 350 mL, R2 0.70) and fewer than half of expert predictions identified blood loss > 500mL (47.5%, 19/40).

The questionnaire was filled by 402 respondents.FindingsThe findings indicate that the impact of COVID-19 on cutting down travel plans, certain personal values and structural constraints have a positive relationship with the leisure travel intention to various destinations. Moreover, risk perceptions and intrapersonal constraints have a positive relationship with domestic leisure travel intentions. However, these factors have a negative connection with the leisure travel intention to some international destinations. Further, decreased perceptions of risks have a negative relationship with the domestic leisure travel intentions.Research limitations/implicationsUsing questionnaires in the form of online, self-administrated surveys made it impossible to get an insight in and have control over who responded to the questionnaire. Gaining an insight into the factors impacting the leisure travel intentions following a period of crisis will make it possible for the tourism industry to respond adequately to future crises and will make it easier for destination marketers and managers to attract new tourists during the recovery process.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, no analysis has been so far published with a focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the Dutch population and their intention to travel. It is crucial for gaining an insight into leisure travel intention and the factors impacting this intention following a period of crisis since travel intention is an under-researched topic of academic tourism literature.

From 2016 onward, the CCS model has been applied successfully among undergraduate and graduate medical students from the Universidad de Talca, Chile; the Universit?t de Barcelona, Spain; and the Universidad de Vic-Manresa, Spain. All the templates for building the clinical cases and the assessment instruments with CCS were printed on paper. Considering the large number of CCS sessions and the number of participating students that are required throughout the medical degree curriculum, it is impossible to keep an organized record when the instruments are printed on paper. Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, web platforms have become important as safe training environments for students and medical faculties; this new educational environment should include the consolidation and adaptation of didactic sessions that create and use available virtual cases and use different web platforms. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to describe the design and development of a web platform that was created to strengthen the CCS model. METHODS: The design of the web platform aimed to support each phase of the CCS by incorporating functional requirements (ie, features that the web platform will be able to perform) and nonfunctional requirements (ie, how the web platform should behave) that are needed to run collaborative sessions. The software was developed under the Model-View-Controller architecture to separate the views from the data model and the business logic. RESULTS: MOSAICO is a web platform used to design, perform, and assess collaborative clinical scenarios for medical students. MOSAICO has four modules: educational design, students' collaborative design, collaborative simulation, and collaborative debriefing. The web platform has three different user profiles: academic simulation unit, teacher, and student. These users interact under different roles in collaborative simulations. MOSAICO enables a collaborative environment, which is connected via the internet, to design clinical scenarios guided by the teacher and enables the use of all data generated to be discussed in the debriefing session with the teacher as a guide. The web platform is running at the Universidad de Talca in Chile and is supporting collaborative simulation activities via the internet for two medical courses: (1) Semiology for third-year students (70 students in total) and (2) Medical Genetics for fifth-year students (30 students in total). CONCLUSIONS: MOSAICO is applicable within the CCS model and is used frequently in different simulation sessions at the Universidad de Talca, where medical students can work collaboratively via the internet. MOSAICO simplifies the application and reuse of clinical simulation scenarios, allowing its use in multiple simulation centers. Moreover, its applications in different courses (ie, a large part of the medical curriculum) support the automatic tracking of simulation activities and their assessment.","output":"A Web Platform (MOSAICO) to Design, Perform, and Assess Collaborative Clinical Scenarios for Medical Students: Viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that emerged originally in Wuhan, the Hubei province of China has put the entire human race at risk This virus was declared as Pandemic on 11th March 2020 Considering the massive growth rate in the number of cases and highly contagious nature of the virus, machine learning prediction models and algorithms are essential to predict the number of cases in the coming days This could help in reducing the stress on health care systems and administrations by helping them plan better In this paper the datasets used are obtained from the John Hopkins University's publicly available datasets to develop a state-of-the-art forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak We have incorporated data-driven estimations and time series analysis to predict the trends in coming days such as the number of cases confirmed positive, number of deaths caused by the virus and number of people recovered from the novel coronavirus To achieve the estimations, we have used the Deep learning model long-shortterm memory network (LSTM) ? 2020 IEEE","output":"COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting of Daily Cases, Deaths Caused and Recovered Cases using Long Short Term Memory Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: COVID 19 is having a devastating effect on mankinds life.

Of >70 known TRIMs, TRIM56 inhibits replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, but has no appreciable effect on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. Yet the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 remains undefined. In particular, how TRIM56 impacts human-pathogenic viruses is unknown. Also unclear are the molecular determinants governing the antiviral activities of TRIM56. Herein, we show that TRIM56 poses a barrier to infections by yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus virus (HCoV) OC43 but not encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Moreover, by engineering cell lines conditionally expressing various TRIM56 mutants, we demonstrated that TRIM56's antiflavivirus effects required both the E3 ligase activity that lies in the N-terminal RING domain and the integrity of its C-terminal portion, while the restriction of HCoV-OC43 relied upon the TRIM56 E3 ligase activity alone. Furthermore, TRIM56 was revealed to impair YFV and DENV2 propagation by suppressing intracellular viral RNA accumulation but to compromise HCoV-OC43 infection at a later step in the viral life cycle, suggesting that distinct TRIM56 domains accommodate differing antiviral mechanisms. Altogether, TRIM56 is a versatile antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV-OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants. IMPORTANCE We previously reported tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) as a host restriction factor of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pathogen. However, the impact of TRIM56 on human-pathogenic RNA viruses is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that TRIM56 restricts two medically important flaviviruses, yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus. Further, we show that TRIM56-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 multiplication depends solely on its E3 ligase activity, whereas its restriction of YFV and DENV2 requires both the E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminal portion. The differing molecular determinants appear to accommodate distinct antiviral mechanisms TRIM56 adopts to target different families of viruses; while TRIM56 curbs intracellular YFV/DENV2 RNA replication, it acts at a later step in HCoV-OC43 life cycle. These novel findings illuminate the molecular basis of the versatility and specificity of TRIM56's antiviral activities against positive-strand RNA viruses.","output":"Overlapping and distinct molecular determinants dictating the antiviral activities of TRIM56 against flaviviruses and coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combining chemo-therapeutics with immune checkpoint inhibitors facilitates killing cancer cells and activating the immune system through inhibiting immune escape. However, their treatment effects remain limited due to the compromised accumulation of both drugs and inhibitors in certain tumor tissues. Herein, a new poly (acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile-co-vinylimidazole-co-bis(2-methacryloyl) oxyethyl disulfide) (PAAVB) polymer-based intelligent platform with controllable upper critical solution temperature (UCST) was used for the simultaneous delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and curcumin (CUR). Additionally, a hyaluronic acid (HA) layer was coated on the surface of PAAVB NPs to target the CD44-overexpressed tumor cells. The proposed nanomedicine demonstrated a gratifying accumulation in tumor tissue and uptake by cancer cells. Then, the acidic microenvironment and high level of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells could spontaneously decrease the UCST of polymer, leading to the disassembly of the NPs and rapid drug release at body temperature without extra-stimuli. Significantly, the released PTX and CUR could induce the immunogenic cell death (ICD) to promote adaptive anti-tumor immunogenicity and inhibit immunosuppression through suppressing the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme respectively.

The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work & Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise.

Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers.

RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous data confirm a positive association of non-communicable diseases, aging, and other sodium-retaining states, including iatrogenic ones, with more severe sometimes fatal clinical course of COVID-19. Reasons for this effect could include increased angiotensin signaling via the AT1R receptor. The endothelial glycocalyx also plays an important role in infection, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation and tissue sodium retention when damaged. RAS inhibitors may help restore glycocalyx function and prevent severe organ damage. Anticoagulants, especially heparin, may also have therapeutic applications due to antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, glycocalyx-repairing, and antialdosteronic properties. The ambiguous influence of some diuretics on sodium balance was also discussed.

Several recently published studies emphasize the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes, thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually solved in the recent years.This review will summarize the most recent technological developments and application of mRNA vaccines in clinical trials and discusses the results, challenges and future directions with a special focus on the induced innate and adaptive immune responses.","output":"Clinical and immunological effects of mRNA vaccines in malignant diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, could give rise to damage the nervous system. Many studies have been conducted on this topic, but few have focused specifically on encephalitis. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the clinical expression of other neurotropic viruses, such as Herpesviridae, is unknown. CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of two young men (39 and 18 years old) in whom SARS-CoV-2 had been detected -reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-, and with a clinical diagnosis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis consistent with encephalitis. The first patient had a positive PCR for varicella zoster virus in CSF, while the second had a positive PCR for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The first patient, who was recently diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, cough, inappropriate behaviour and epileptic seizures; the second was seen to have fever, headache, myalgia and exanthema. Both offered the same laboratory findings (lymphopenia and high interleukin 6). CSF showed pleocytosis with a predominance of monomorphonuclear cells, hyperproteinorrachia and normal glycorrhachia. A cranial CT scan showed only mild diffuse cerebral oedema in the first case. Both cases were treated with corticosteroids, antibiotics and acyclovir. The second progressed favourably, while the first did not. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with neurotropic viruses, such as Herpesviridae, and we have only limited evidence of direct neurological involvement of SARS-CoV-2, due to the technical difficulty of detecting it in the nervous system, thus making it important to take co-infection into account in order to be able to establish an early diagnosis and treatment to improve prognosis.","output":"[COVID-19 and herpesvirus encephalitis]./ COVID-19 y encefalitis por herpesvirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nationally agreed standards improve the level of care delivered to all older, frail, multi-morbid patients presenting with hip fractures. Dedicated Orthogeriatric services allow for these standards to be achieved in a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) setting. As the COVID-19 pandemic reached our shores, the model of care set out by the Irish Hip Fracture Standards (IHFS) was under threat. Our dedicated Orthopaedic Trauma ward became an acute COVID ward and the Orthogeriatric service was re-deployed to acute medicine for Quarter 2. METHODS: Using the Irish Hip Fracture Database, local data was analysed and compared with national data from Quarter 1 to 4 (Q1C4) in 2020. RESULTS: When comparing local IHFSs with national figures, ongoing challenges and future goals are highlighted. In 2020, there were 222 hip fracture patients (mean age 81.8 years) in our hospital. Standard 1, time to the ward <4 hours, stands at 71% locally (national average 33%). Standard 2, time to theatre <48 hours, is an ongoing challenge and remains at 66% (national average 75%). Standard 3, pressure ulcer rate, was the same as the national average at 3%. Standards 4, 5 and 6 in our hospital stand at 87% (national averages of 82%, 91% and 85% respectively). In Q1, 56%, or over 1 in every 2 patients with hip fractures, met all of the Irish Hip Fracture Standards in our hospital. In Q2, only 18% of patients met all of the IHFSs. Q3 saw improvements with 47% of all hip fracture patients achieving all IHFSs. Q4 showed maintenance with 45% of all patients achieving all IHFSs. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for a dedicated Orthogeriatric Service and Orthopaedic ward at all times. Going forward with the risk of future waves and the emergence of new variants, every effort should be made to maintain a comprehensive orthogeriatric service to minimise a negative impact on patient care.","output":"103 ORTHOGERIATRIC SERVICES IN THE FACE OF COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is known to present with disease severities of varying degree. In its most severe form, infection may lead to respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction. Here we study the levels of extracellular histone H3 (H3), neutrophil elastase (NE) and cfDNA in relation to other plasma parameters, including the immune modulators GAS6 and AXL, ICU scoring systems and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We measured plasma H3, NE, cfDNA, GAS6 and AXL concentration in plasma of 83 COVID-19-positive and 11 COVID-19-negative patients at admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Uppsala University hospital, a tertiary hospital in Sweden and a total of 333 samples obtained from these patients during the ICU-stay. We determined their correlation with disease severity, organ failure, mortality and other blood parameters. Results: H3, NE, cfDNA, GAS6 and AXL were increased in plasma of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. cfDNA and GAS6 decreased in time in in patients surviving to 30 days post ICU admission. Plasma H3 was a common feature of COVID-19 patients, detected in 40% of the patients at ICU admission. Although these measures were not predictive of the final outcome of the disease, they correlated well with parameters of tissue damage (H3 and cfDNA) and neutrophil counts (NE). A subset of samples displayed H3 processing, possibly due to proteolysis. Conclusions: Elevated H3 and cfDNA levels in COVID-19 patients illustrate the severity of the cellular damage observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The epidemiology of the disease calls for a pressing need to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Prediction models such as Bayesian networks, which can probabilistically reason under uncertainty, could assist caregivers with patient management. However, some concerns are associated with the standard approaches to developing these structures in medicine. Therefore, this study aims to compare Bayesian network structures that stem from these two techniques. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 6754 locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients enrolled in 14 international clinical trials. Local tumor recurrence at 2, 3, and 5-years was defined as the endpoints of interest. Five rectal cancer treating physicians from three countries elicited the expert structure. The algorithmic structure was inferred from the data with the hill-climbing algorithm. Structural performance was assessed with calibration plots and area under the curve values. RESULTS: The area under the curve for the expert structure on the training and validation data was above 0.9 and 0.8, respectively, for all the time points. However, the algorithmic structure had superior predictive performance over the expert structure for all time points of interest. CONCLUSION: We have developed and internally validated a Bayesian networks structure from experts opinions, which can predict the risk of a LARC patient developing a tumor recurrence at 2, 3, and 5 years. Our result shows that the algorithmic-based structures are more performant and less interpretable than expert-based structures.","output":"Bayesian network structure for predicting local tumor recurrence in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global mechanical ventilator shortage for treatment of severe acute respiratory failure Development of novel breathing devices have been proposed as a low cost, rapid solution when full-featured ventilators are unavailable We report the design, bench testing, and preclinical animal data for an 'Automated Bag Breathing Unit' (ABBU) METHODS: ABBU design uses a motor-driven wheel assembly for bag compression, calibrated for tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate, inspiratory time, manual PEEP, and pressure-sensing assist with a modified 6' patient circuit Berkshire pigs (n=5, weight 60 521 5 kg) were ventilated for 6 hours PaCO2 and PaO2 in arterial blood were measured with varying Vt (200, 400, 600, 800 mL), rate (10, 20, 30, 40 bpm), and PEEP (5, 10, 15) in a healthy and injured swine model with synchronous and asynchronous ABBU operation RESULTS: Bench testing with a Michigan dual-lung simulator yielded consistent Vt delivery at compliances of 0 02, 0 04 and 0 07 (L/cmH20) Dependence of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) with minute ventilation (VE) for a fixed inlet O2 flow rate (5 L/min) in ABBU was measured (47% - 98% FiO2 for 16-4 L/min VE respectively) FiO2 improved with higher O2 flows up to 15 L/min Gas exchange was evaluated in a porcine model before and after saline lavage induced lung injury When increasing Vt or rate, ABBU lowered PaCO2 to physiological levels (40 mmHg) from induced-hypercapnia, before and after saline lung injury Changes from high to low PaCO2 positively correlated with changes in VE Incremental PEEP trials improved PaO2 levels Patient assist was studied while the animal was under light anesthesia Of 1650 breaths, there were 1190 true positives, 416 true negatives, 44 false negatives, and no false positives ABBU was able to maintain appropriate O2 and CO2 blood concentrations during spontaneous synchronous breathing CONCLUSIONS: ABBU provides both oxygenation and ventilation across a range of respiratory parameter settings that support a lung protective ventilation strategy in most adults A human clinical trial is required to establish safety and efficacy for patients with diverse etiologies of respiratory failure","output":"Automated bag breathing unit for COVID-19 ventilator shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An elderly African American woman presented to our clinic following 9 months of right-sided unilateral headache, otorrhoea and progressive hearing loss.

METHODS: After providing informed consent, penile tissue was collected from patients undergoing surgery for inflatable penile prosthesis due to severe ED under an IRB approved protocol. Two specimens were obtained from men with a history of COVID-19 infection and two specimens were obtained from men with no history of infection (all men tested negative immediately before surgery). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) expression (marker of endothelial function). Tissue from COVID-19 (+) and COVID-19 (-) specimens were imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) function was assessed ex vivo by determination of endothelial colony forming units from blood samples collected from the COVID-19 (+) and COVID (-) men with severe ED. RESULTS: TEM showed extracellular viral particles w100 nm in diameter with prominent peplomers (spikes) near penile vascular endothelial cells of the COVID-19 (+) patient (Figure 1A + 1B) and the absence of viral particles in control tissue. Immunohistochemistry showed eNOS expression in the corpus cavernosum of COVID (+) men was significantly decreased compared to COVID (-) men suggesting endothelial dysfunction (Figure 1C).

Results In total, 166 articles met our eligibility criteria. The vast majority (129 studies, 78%) of models evaluated the effectiveness NPIs. NPI effectiveness was predominantly modelled in China and Italy, but varied by global region. Asian studies largely evaluated the impact of quarantine and isolation (64 studies), whereas European modelling studies modelled the impact of containment (15 studies), quarantine of travellers, and the isolation of cases. Early models primarily concerned compartmental, deterministic frameworks using SEIR or variants of SEIR compartments (93 studies, 56%) assuming homogenous, symptomatic transmission. Incorporation of parameter uncertainty through model calibration (inference of unknown parameters by fitting models to data) and sensitivity analyses were relatively common (66% and 56% of studies respectively), the former mainly using Chinese data. In contrast, inclusion of structural uncertainty (uncertainty in disease characteristics) was relatively uncommon, as was validation of model output to external data. Conclusion This work allows for the identification of existing challenges in the mathematical modelling of emerging diseases, and emphasises minimal criteria for enhancing reliable model estimation and reporting. Limited availability of epidemiological data in the early phase of a new disease treat challenges model calibration to local, and validation to external data, emphasising the critical importance of enforcing standardised protocols for early epi-data collection, and raising awareness among modellers and decision-makers alike in handling uncertainty.","output":"Mathematical modelling of COVID-19: a systematic review and quality assessment in the early epidemic response phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia have recently been reported within 4 to 28 days of vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford) and Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines. An immune-mediated response associated with platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies has been proposed as the underlying pathomechanism. Objective To determine the frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies in patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a descriptive analysis of a retrospective sample of consecutive patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis between January 1987 and March 2018 from 7 hospitals participating in the International Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Consortium from Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Mexico, Iran, and Costa Rica. Of 952 patients, 865 with available baseline platelet count were included. In a subset of 93 patients, frozen plasma samples collected during a previous study between September 2009 and February 2016 were analyzed for the presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Exposures Diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Main Outcomes and Measures Frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 103/L), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (as diagnosed by the treating physician), and platelet factor 4/heparin IgG antibodies (optical density >0.4, in a subset of patients with previously collected plasma samples). Results Of 865 patients (median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 29-53 years], 70% women), 73 (8.4%; 95% CI, 6.8%-10.5%) had thrombocytopenia, which was mild (100-149 103/L) in 52 (6.0%), moderate (50-99 103/L) in 17 (2.0%), and severe (<50 103/L) in 4 (0.5%). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies was diagnosed in a single patient (0.1%; 95% CI, <0.1%-0.7%). Of the convenience sample of 93 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis included in the laboratory analysis, 8 (9%) had thrombocytopenia, and none (95% CI, 0%-4%) had platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance In patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, baseline thrombocytopenia was uncommon, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies were rare. These findings may inform investigations of the possible association between the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia.","output":"Frequency of Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Factor 4/Heparin Antibodies in Patients With Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Coronavirus diseases such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose serious threats. Portable and accurate nucleic acid detection is still an urgent need to achieve on-site virus screening and timely infection control. Herein, we have developed an on-site, semiautomatic detection system, aiming at simultaneously overcoming the shortcomings suffered by various commercially available assays, such as low accuracy, poor portability, instrument dependency, and labor intensity. Ultrasensitive isothermal amplification [i.e., reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)] was applied to generate intensified SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals, which were then transduced to portable commercial pregnancy test strips (PTSs) via ultraspecific human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-conjugated toehold-mediated strand exchange (TMSE) probes (hCG-P). The entire detection was integrated into a four-channel, palm-size microfluidic device, named the microfluidic point-of-care (POC) diagnosis system based on the PTS (MPSP) detection system. It provides rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive detection, of which the lowest concentration of detection was 0.5 copy/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, regardless of the presence of other similar viruses, even highly similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The successful detection of the authentic samples from different resources evaluated the practical application. The commercial PTS provides a colorimetric visible signal, which is instrument- and optimization-free. Therefore, this MPSP system can be immediately used for SARS-CoV-2 emergency detection, and it is worthy of further optimization to achieve full automation and detection for other infectious diseases.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Point-of-Care (POC) Diagnosis Based on Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips and a Palm-Size Microfluidic Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of March 2020, just over a month after the first ascertained case of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, the first reports of acute lesions of acro-ischemia appeared, especially in pre-adolescents and adolescents These manifestations have been called in the course of these months in various ways, from \\"acro-ischemia acuta\\", \\"erythema pernio\\", \\"chilblains\\", up to characterize them more recently as \\"CoViD Toes\\" Clinical manifestations do not usually associate with other typical symptoms of Covid-19 and do not find a classical and defined serological antibody response (IgG and IgM) From a clinical point of view it is a localized and self-resolving problem of an interesting and relatively new pathogenetic model of disease in relation to a viral agent Future studies must make us understand if there is in this specific condition a low viral load is not detectable by current methods and if this explains the inability to produce an adequate immune response for CoViD-19 It is important to determine whether the interferon immune response in some subjects can be the cause of both the low viremia and the endothelial damage so localized in the acral-site, as happens in other models of diseases (chilblain-lupus like) On the contrary, some authors believe that the acral lesions are attributable to chilblains caused by a series of favourable environmental conditions due to forced enclosure We report the descriptive experience of 14 cases of acro-ischemia in children and adolescents observed in the territorial area of Ravenna and Rimini The cases were subjected to the nasopharyngeal swab and to the search for antibodies with ELISA method for CoViD-19 both with negative results","output":"Acro-ischemic injuries in children-adolescents during CoViD-19 pandemic: from lifestyle changes due to lockdown to interferone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Israeli Defense Forces Medical Corps (IDF-MC) implemented the use of low-titer group O whole blood (LTOWB) as the first-choice resuscitation fluid in the IDF airborne Combat Search and Rescue Unit (IDF-CSAR) for aerial evacuation of both military and civilian casualties in June 2018 for injured patients with hemorrhagic shock and at least one of the following: systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, heart rate >130 beats/min, deterioration of consciousness without head injury or hemoglobin concentration 7 g/dL. Method: All casualties treated with LTOWB by IDF-CSAR providers from June 2018 to January 2021 were included. Demographic and prehospital treatment data were collected in order to check compliance and adherence to the IDF-MC guidelines. This is a follow-up retrospective report. Results: Overall, 1,608 LTOWB units were supplied to the IDF-CSAR during the study period. Of these, 33 were transfused to 27 casualties; 17 (69%) with blunt injury, 8 (29.6%) with penetrating injuries, and 1 (3.7%) with gastrointestinal bleeding without trauma. The leading cause of injury was motor vehicle accidents. A total of 23 casualties received 1 unit of LTOWB, 3 received 2 units and 1 patient received 4 units. Two casualties were children. The median heart rate was 120 beats/min, 8 (29.6%) casualties had heart rates >130 beats/min. Median systolic blood pressure was 95 mm Hg, 7 (26%) casualties had blood pressure <90 mm Hg.

This constant pressure and friction against the skin may contribute to increased wearer pain, irritation, and discomfort. The purpose of this work is to report a modified 3D printed mask extender to alleviate discomfort and increase mask wearability by relieving posterior auricular pressure from isolation masks. METHODS: Our institutional review board designated this project as non-human research and exempt. As part of resourcing 3D printing laboratories along with individual 3D printers to provide resources to healthcare workers, mask extenders were printed to relieve posterior auricular pressure from individuals wearing isolation masks. The authors modifed an existing mask extender, increasing its length with accompanying peripheral rungs for isolation mask securement. 3D printing was performed with Ultimaker S5 (Ultimaker B.V.; Geldermalsen, Netherlands) and CR-10 (Creality3D; Shenzhen, China) 3D printers using polylactic acid filaments. The authors modified extended mask extenders were printed and freely delivered to healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, technologists, and other personnel) at the authors institution. RESULTS: The final mask extender design was printed with the two 3D printers with a maximum 7 straps printed simultaneously on each 3D printer. Mean print times ranges from 105 min for the Ultimaker S5 printer and 150 min for the CR-10. Four hundred seventy-five mask extenders were delivered to healthcare workers at the authors institution, with the demand far exceeding the available supply. CONCLUSION: We offer a modification of a 3D printed mask extender design that decreases discomfort and increases the wearability of isolation mask designs with ear loops thought to relieve posterior auricular skin pressure and ability to control strap tension. The design is simple, produced with inexpensive material (polylactic acid), and have been well-received by healthcare providers at our institution.","output":"3D printed mask extenders as a supplement to isolation masks to relieve posterior auricular discomfort: an innovative 3D printing response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been widely spreading.

Inflammation response, thought to be associated with severe illness and death, is an important research topic in COVID-19. Inflammation is also an essential condition explored in psychiatric illnesses. Our knowledge about the relationship between the inflammation response and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 is very limited. In this study, the relationship between anxiety and depression levels and inflammation response of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the hospital was examined. METHODS: 175 patients were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied to the patients. To evaluate the inflammation responses, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and IL-6 levels were examined. RESULTS: In our study, no relationship was found between anxiety and depression levels and inflammatory responses in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Anxiety and depression levels of women were higher than men, and NLR, ferritin, IL-6 levels were found to be lower than men. Anxiety levels increase with age. There is a positive correlation between NLR and ferritin levels and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our study examining the relationship of psychiatric comorbidities with the inflammation response and our increasing literature knowledge, together with studies evaluating the mental effects of COVID-19, suggest that determining the relationship between inflammation responses and psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19, whose pathophysiology has not been clarified yet, maybe an essential step in interventions on the course of the disease.","output":"Do Anxiety and Depression Levels Affect the Inflammation Response in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to analyze the connection between anti-crisis fiscal measures adopted by EU governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and these countries GDP growth The study relies on methods of statistical analysis, including cluster analysis, to examine the challenges of forecasting tax revenue collections during the COVID-19 pandemic It is possible to make preliminary conclusions regarding the relationship between fiscal anti-crisis measures in EU countries and these countries' GDP growth even in the absence of the actual data The study has revealed variations in forecast GDP growth caused by a higher than usual degree of uncertainty The best way to minimize such variations is to constantly monitor the situation and adjust the forecast estimates depending on the changes in the relevant factors The variations in forecast estimates can also stem from adjustments for the changes in tax revenues of EU countries implementing fiscal anti-crisis measures Most EU countries resorted to such instruments as deferral of certain tax payments, temporary tax breaks, reduction of tax rates, tax loss carryforwards, cancellation or reductions of social contributions The European leaders in terms of anti-crisis fiscal measures are the Czech Republic and Ireland - these countries used four out of five instruments and were followed by Austria, Hungary and the UK, which used three instruments We also analyzed the coefficient of tax elasticity for European countries and demonstrated that tax reliefs (tax preferences) influence the level of tax revenue The hypothesis that there is an indirect connection between the anti-crisis fiscal measures and GDP growth was confirmed It is shown that clusters of EU countries grouped depending on their anti-crisis fiscal measures do not coincide with the clusters of countries grouped depending on their GDP growth estimates Thus, a tentative forecast can be made that the fiscal anti-crisis measures taken by EU countries will not have a direct impact on their GDP growth","output":"Anti-Crisis Fiscal Measures in the European Union during the COVID-19 Pandemic and their Impact on GDP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 crisis since fear of contamination is highly prevalent in this illness and disease reminders are omnipresent during this crisis.

Twenty-two patients and 13 family members were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences and challenges caused by the pandemic and home-confinement directives.

Five overarching themes were identified: (1) changing point of reference: confusion and legitimization of OCD behavior, (2) coping strategies were challenged: too much or too little exposure to obsessional concerns, (3) distress but also relief in some areas, (4) developing a new equilibrium within the family, (5) changes in accessibility and nature of therapy: perils and merits of online treatment. These findings make clear the importance of the accessibility of mental health services during this pandemic through direct patient contacts or in a remote format. In therapy therapists should focus on challenging the changing point of reference, providing practical advice on coping, stimulating to engage in exposure and encouraging patients to seek social support.

However, data comparing nondialysis CKD and ESKD are sparse. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to three hospitals in the New York area, between March 2 and August 27, 2020, were retrospectively studied using electronic health records. Patients were classified as those without CKD, those with nondialysis CKD, and those with ESKD, with outcomes including hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mortality rates. Results Of 3905 patients, 588 (15%) had nondialysis CKD and 128 (3%) had ESKD. The nondialysis CKD and ESKD groups had a greater prevalence of comorbidities and higher admission D-dimer levels, whereas patients with ESKD had lower C-reactive protein levels at admission. ICU admission rates were similar across all three groups (23%-25%). The overall, unadjusted hospital mortality was 25%, and the mortality was 24% for those without CKD, 34% for those with nondialysis CKD, and 27% for those with ESKD. Among patients in the ICU, mortality was 56%, 64%, and 56%, respectively. Although patients with nondialysis CKD had higher odds of overall mortality versus those without CKD in univariate analysis (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.91), this was no longer significant in fully adjusted models (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.40). Also, ESKD status did not associate with a higher risk of mortality compared with non-CKD in adjusted analyses, but did have reduced mortality when compared with nondialysis CKD (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.95). Mortality rates declined precipitously after the first 2 months of the pandemic, from 26% to 14%, which was reflected in all three subgroups. Conclusions In a diverse cohort of patients with COVID-19, we observed higher crude mortality rates for patients with nondialysis CKD and, to a lesser extent, ESKD, which were not significant after risk adjustment.

In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential.

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection.

To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is 2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified.

Several clinical prediction tools for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with AECOPD have been developed in the past decades. However, some issues concerning the validity and availability of some predictors in the existing models may undermine their clinical applicability in resource-limited clinical settings. METHODS: We developed a multivariable model for predicting in-hospitality from a retrospective cohort of patients admitted with AECOPD to one tertiary care center in Thailand from October 2015 to September 2017. Multivariable logistic regression with fractional polynomial algorithms and cluster variance correction was used for model derivation. RESULTS: During the study period, 923 admissions from 600 patients with AECOPD were included. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.68 per 100 admission-day. Eleven potential predictors from the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression. The reduced model, named MAGENTA, incorporated seven final predictors: age, body temperature, mean arterial pressure, the requirement of endotracheal intubation, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and serum albumin. The model discriminative ability based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC) was excellent at 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.77, 0.86), and the calibration was good.

However, metagenomic surveys in bats often do not result in full-length viral sequences that can be used to regenerate such viruses for targeted characterization4. Here, we identify and characterize a novel morbillivirus from a vespertilionid bat species (Myotis riparius) in Brazil, which we term myotis bat morbillivirus (MBaMV). There are 7 species of morbilliviruses including measles virus (MeV), canine distemper virus (CDV) and rinderpest virus (RPV)5. All morbilliviruses cause severe disease in their natural hosts6C10, and pathogenicity is largely determined by species specific expression of canonical morbillivirus receptors, CD150/SLAMF111 and NECTIN412. MBaMV used Myotis spp CD150 much better than human and dog CD150 in fusion assays. We confirmed this using live MBaMV that was rescued by reverse genetics. Surprisingly, MBaMV replicated efficiently in primary human myeloid but not lymphoid cells. Furthermore, MBaMV replicated in human epithelial cells and used human NECTIN4 almost as well as MeV. Our results demonstrate the unusual ability of MBaMV to infect and replicate in some human cells that are critical for MeV pathogenesis and transmission. This raises the specter of zoonotic transmission of a bat morbillivirus.","output":"Zoonotic potential of a novel bat morbillivirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of contact tracing, be it between individuals (e.g. sexually transmitted diseases or severe acute respiratory syndrome) or between groups of individuals (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease; FMD), is difficult to evaluate without precise knowledge of the underlying contact structure; i.e. who is connected to whom? Motivated by the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, we determine, using stochastic simulations and deterministic 'moment closure' models of disease transmission on networks of premises (nodes), network and disease properties that are important for contact tracing efficiency. For random networks with a high average number of connections per node, little clustering of connections and short latency periods, contact tracing is typically ineffective. In this case, isolation of infected nodes is the dominant factor in determining disease epidemic size and duration. If the latency period is longer and the average number of connections per node small, or if the network is spatially clustered, then the contact tracing performs better and an overall reduction in the proportion of nodes that are removed during an epidemic is observed.","output":"Disease contact tracing in random and clustered networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rare earth elements (REEs) have been a topic of profound interest for several decades especially in the present age of electronic and digital revolution. India has the worlds richest beach sands with REEs, yet it imports some strategic REEs to fulfil its demand. Its high time to explore alternative sources to meet its demand and coal ash from Thermal Power Stations (TPS) can be a very good alternative resource. In the present study, coal and coal fly ash (CFA) from seven Indian TPSs have been evaluated for estimation of REEs and variations in minerals compositions. Mineralogy of the samples is estimated using X-Ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Coal samples mostly consist of quartz and kaolinite however phase transformations of minerals occurred due to high temperature treatment during combustion. CFA mostly contains quartz and mullite. REEs have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and considerable occurrence of any specific REE is not observed. Among the studied TPSs, Pr has the highest concentration among REEs in ash, reaching up to 63 ppm. The Outlook Coefficient (C(out)) of REEs is in the range of 0.3C4.5 and 0.1C1.2 for coal and CFA respectively. In this research paper, Enrichment Coefficient ((e)) has been introduced to see the enrichment of REE in CFA with respect to the mother coal and a graph of (e) vs glassy phase has been plotted to observe the partitioning of REEs.

This is especially because of the inaccessibility to post-stroke rehabilitation outside hospitals. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis and the pandemic restrictions in Malaysia are expected to exponentially increase the demand from family caregivers in supporting stroke survivors. Thus, this study aims to explore the burden, experience, and coping mechanism of the family caregivers supporting stroke survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: A phenomenological qualitative study was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021 in Malaysia. A total of 13 respondents were recruited from two public rehabilitation centers in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. In-depth interviews were conducted with the participants. Comprehensive representation of perspectives from the respondents was achieved through purposive sampling. The interviews were conducted in the Kelantanese dialect, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes on burdens and experiences were identified. They were worsening pre-existing issues, emerging new issues, and fewer burdens and challenges. Two themes on coping strategies were also identified. They were problem-focused engagement and emotion-focused engagement. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the entire system of stroke management. While family caregivers mostly faced the extra burden through different experiences, they also encountered some positive impacts from the pandemic. The integrated healthcare system, especially in the era of digitalization, is an important element to establish the collaborative commitment of multiple stakeholders to compensate burden and sustain the healthcare of stroke survivors during the pandemic.","output":"Family Caregivers Experiences and Coping Strategies in Managing Stroke Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have shown high effectiveness in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe disease, and death. Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might get infected and suffer significant morbidity. Characteristics of vaccine breakthrough infections have not been studied. We sought to portray the population of Israeli patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study of 17 hospitals included Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 fully-vaccinated patients who developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the second vaccine dose and required hospitalization. The risk for poor outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical ventilation or death, was assessed. RESULTS: 152 patients were included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully-vaccinated patients in Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and mortality rate reached 22% (34/152). Notable, the cohort was characterized by a high rate of comorbidities predisposing to severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108, 71%), diabetes (73, 48%), CHF (41, 27%), chronic kidney and lung diseases (37, 24% each), dementia (29, 19%), and cancer (36, 24%), and only 6 (%) had no comorbidities. Sixty (40%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher SARS-CoV-2 viral-load was associated with a significant risk for poor outcome. Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titers of anti-spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: We found that severe COVID-19 infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully-vaccinated individuals with multiple comorbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of comorbidities and immunosuppression compared to previously reported non-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further characterization of this vulnerable population may help to develop guidance to augment their protection, either by continued social-distancing, or by additional active or passive vaccinations.","output":"BNT162b2 vaccine breakthrough: clinical characteristics of 152 fully-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is characterized by generalized erythema and desquamation affecting more than 75% of body surface area and usually accompanied by systemic symptoms.

Since self-compassion is related to both physical and psychological well-being, measuring and understanding self-compassion in different populations carries importance for their mental well-being and life satisfaction outcomes. One such group is the youth, who experience unique developmental challenges. For this purpose, a Self-Compassion Scale for Youth (SCS-Y) was developed (Neff et al., 2021) and this paper presents its Turkish adaptation. The Turkish translation of SCS-Y was tested on a sample of Turkish youth (N = 450, 61.8% female, M(age)= 13.09  1.59, range = 11C15) and was found to have acceptable reliability. The scale showed a similar structure to the original testing on American youth with a bifactor model of a general self-compassion score and six subscale scores, and a two-bifactor model where negative and positive aspects are grouped together. Self-compassion was positively related to resilience and well-being, and negatively related to depression. A serial mediation analysis showed self-compassion to have a direct and positive effect on resilience, and to have an indirect effect on well-being mediated by resilience and depression. Given that the trainable skill of self-compassion is associated with higher resilience, lower depression, and better well-being, the value of this scale and its different adaptations becomes evident, as they enable measuring self-compassion in youth in various populations such as the present Turkish one and guiding the design of future interventions to increase self-compassion, targeted for the specific concerns of the youth.","output":"Self-Compassion Scale for Youth: Turkish Adaptation and Exploration of the Relationship with Resilience, Depression, and Well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quarantine, lockdowns and mandatory isolation have slowed the transmission of Covid-19.

METHODS: We performed a cross sectional review of our new hub which was introduced in our tertiary centre to priortise care of the older person.We analysed attendees from February to June 2021 (20 weeks of data). RESULTS: There were 121 new patient reviews and 127 follow up consultations.Commonly requested reason for referral was medical assessment (30%), cognitive assessments (30%) and falls(28%). Referral sources were analysed and included consultant referrals (11% n = 13), GP referrals (55% n = 67), multidisciplinary team referrals (6% n = 7) and emergency department referrals (26% n = 32).

We aimed to determine the impact of mannitol on outcome among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). METHODS INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial of 2839 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure allocated to intensive (target systolic blood pressure, <140 mm Hg within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended (target systolic blood pressure, <180 mm Hg) blood pressure-lowering treatment. Propensity score and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between mannitol treatment (within 7 days) and poor outcome, defined by death or major disability on the modified Rankin Scale score (3-6) at 90 days. RESULTS There was no significant difference in poor outcome between mannitol (n=1533) and nonmannitol (n=993) groups: propensity score-matched odds ratio of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.09; P=0.30) and multivariable odds ratio of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.07; P=0.18). Although a better outcome was suggested in patients with larger (15 mL) than those with smaller (<15 mL) baseline hematomas who received mannitol (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.78] versus odds ratio, 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15]; P homogeneity<0.03 in propensity score analyses), the association was not consistent in analyses across other cutoff points (10 and 20 mL) and for differing grades of neurological severity.

However, it can cause debilitating long-term effects. Understanding the impact of alloHSCT on all aspects of the patients' life is required for optimal survivorship management. Aim: To explore in-depth HSCT-survivors' experiences and needs post-transplant. Partners were included to provide further information on survivors' needs and how care could be improved in this area. Methods: We conducted semi-structured face-to-face and phone interviews with alloHSCT-survivors and their partners referred to a survivorship clinic in Germany. Theoretical sampling was used to recruit participants. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Thirty-two survivors (consent rate: 100%, response rate: 100%) and eighteen partners (consent rate: 84%, response rate: 72%) participated. Survivors were aged between 25 and 68 years (Median: 48, IQR: 25.3) and partners were aged between 26 and 64 years (Median: 54, IQR: 16, SD: 12.8). The themes emerging from the data involved survivors' needs included (i) the diversity of long-term treatment side-effects; and (ii) time post discharge as a dynamic process with individual peaks of burden. Survivors and their partners also suggested strategies for mitigating these unmet needs, i.e., (iii) transparent communication and patient empowerment; and (iv) improvement in continuity of care system and help with claiming social benefits as cornerstones of optimal survivorship care. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies focused on the views of German alloHSCT-survivors on the long-term effects of alloHSCT and the first study integrating the view of their partners. Healthcare providers could better support survivors with managing their symptoms and adhering to their prescribed care by ensuring comprehensive, transparent communication that helps increase survivors' understanding and involvement in their care. Further efforts should be made to provide patient-centered, continuous survivorship care that involves additional support with navigating the healthcare and social service system.

Administered as prodrugs, these drugs are taken up by HIV-infected target cells, undergo intracellular phosphorylation and compete with natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) for incorporation into nascent viral DNA during reverse transcription. Once incorporated, they halt reverse transcription. In vitro studies have proposed that TDF and FTC act synergistically within an HIV-infected cell. However, it is unclear whether, and which, direct drugCdrug interactions mediate the apparent synergy. The goal of this work was to refine a mechanistic model for the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) of nucleoside analogues in order to analyse whether putative direct interactions may account for the in vitro observed synergistic effects. Our analysis suggests that depletion of dNTP pools can explain apparent synergy between TDF and FTC in HIV-infected cells at clinically relevant concentrations. Dead-end complex (DEC) formation does not seem to significantly contribute to the synergistic effect.

Yang and Lee (2021) proposed a state-space model with variational Bayes (SSVB) for ODE, capable of fast and stable estimation in somewhat large ODE models. The method has shown excellent performance in parameter estimation but has a weakness of underestimation of the posterior covariance, which originates from the mean-field variational method. This paper proposes a way to overcome the weakness by using the Laplace approximation. In numerical experiments, the covariance modified by the Laplace approximation showed a high degree of improvement when checked against the covariances obtained by a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

Spread of pandemics is frequently associated with increased population size and population density. The geographical scales (national, regional or local scale) are key elements in determining the correlation between demographic factors and the spread of outbreaks. The aims of this study were: (a) to collect the Mexican data related to the two pandemics; (b) to create thematic maps using federal and municipal geographic scales; (c) to investigate the correlations between the pandemics indicators (numbers of contagious and deaths) and demographic patterns (population size and density). METHODS: The demographic patterns of all Mexican Federal Entities and all municipalities were taken from the database of Instituto Nacional de Estadstica y Geografa (INEGI). The data of Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Control de Enfermedades (CENAPRECE) and the geoportal of Mexico Government were also used in our analysis. The results are presented by means of tables, graphs and thematic maps. A Spearman correlation was used to assess the associations between the pandemics indicators and the demographic patterns. Correlations with a p value < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The confirmed cases (ccH1N1) and deaths (dH1N1) registered during the H1N1 Influenza pandemic were 72.4 thousand and 1.2 thousand respectively. Mexico City (CDMX) was the most affected area by the pandemic with 8,502 ccH1N1 and 152 dH1N1. The ccH1N1 and dH1N1 were positively correlated to demographic patterns; p-values higher than the level of marginal significance were found analyzing the % ccH1N1 and the % dH1N1 vs the population density. The COVID-19 pandemic data indicated 75.0 million confirmed cases (ccCOVID-19) and 1.6 million deaths (dCOVID-19) worldwide, as of date. The CDMX, where 264,330 infections were recorded, is the national epicenter of the pandemic. The federal scale did not allow to observe the correlation between demographic data and pandemic indicators; hence the next step was to choose a more detailed geographical scale (municipal basis). The ccCOVID-19 and dCOVID-19 (municipal basis) were highly correlated with demographic patterns; also the % ccCOVID-19 and % dCOVID-19 were moderately correlated with demographic patterns. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic is much greater than the H1N1 Influenza pandemic. The CDMX was the national epicenter in both pandemics. The federal scale did not allow to evaluate the correlation between exanimated demographic variables and the spread of infections, but the municipal basis allowed the identification of local variations and red zones such as the delegation of Iztapalapa and Gustavo A.

Similarly, epistemic conflict over challenges to behavioral and social well-being in 2020 may highlight discordance between the dominant biomedical paradigm used in making federal policy and the inherently holistic impact of that policy on population health, suggesting need for a new paradigm of multidisciplinary scientific engagement. Because population-wide public health initiatives affect many aspects of healthphysiological, psychological, behavioral, and socialthat are best measured and interpreted by experts in these respective fields, multidisciplinary scientific engagement would facilitate optimal, holistic evaluation of policy benefits and harms. This multidisciplinary approach, analogous to that currently recommended in medical management of chronic disease, would advance epidemiological research to inform evidence-based policy for public health crises in which U.S. population-wide interventions are contemplated.","output":"Pandemics, Policy, and the Power of Paradigm: Will COVID-19 Lead to a New Scientific Revolution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelial barrier dysfunction in the elderly has been associated with severe disorders, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and COVID-19.

This paper describes how we derived optimal parameters for a decentralized CT from extensive measurement campaigns that we carried out together with Deutsche Telekom (DT) and SAP under the supervision of the Robert Koch Institut (RKI). We examined the Google/Apple Exposure Notification Framework (ENF), which in combination with the front-end, i.e., the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA), enables digital CT in Germany. With centimeter accurate optical reference systems we show that optimal parameters are application-specific. However, they cause impractical high resource costs.

The world saw a paradigm shift in the education system favouring online learning during the constrains of pandemic. METHODOLOGY: To assess the attitude of the students towards online learning in subject of ENT, we conducted an observational study among 170 third year MBBS undergraduate students of our institute attending online classes through the student portal of our university website. RESULTS: Our survey revealed students favoured online learning to sustain their academic interest and development during this pandemic. Yet, they perceived many challenges during online learning like lack of face-to-face interactions, lack of socialization, distraction by social media, technology related issues etc. Students also opted for a combined approach of learning in the post pandemic period. CONCLUSION: This article reflects the challenges faced during online learning and added the innovative methods that can be included to overcome the obstacles of online learning. During this period of COVID, one must embrace the alternative to classroom learning to keep up with ones academic development and can consider an integrated approach of learning after the pandemic.

Methods: To inform safe reopening, we used an augmented SEIR model to project the impact of 1) interventions and potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreader (SS) events and/or international travel and 2) re-introducing strong behavioural interventions on resurgence trajectories. Results: Our model suggests that 50% behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE) (from enforced social distancing during lockdown, early in the epidemic), along with 50% isolation intervention effectiveness (IIE) (from increased testing and isolating infected individuals) was achieved during lockdown, which curbed COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. Post-lockdown, BIE plays a minimal role if IIE reaches or exceeds 46.9% when other variables are held constant. At IIE of 30% and BIE of 21.3%, SS events of 5,000 active cases risks COVID-19 resurgence, with 4-year projected 12.9mn cumulative cases and 1.1mn deaths. Earlier action to increase BIE to 50% on day 98 compared to day 111, prevented an additional 21,401 recovered cases and 257 deaths. Conclusion: Until a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, the risk of COVID-19 resurgence from large SS events warrants caution in decisions to allow for mass gatherings and regular international travel.","output":"Projecting the impact of behaviour and isolation interventions and super spreader events from mass gatherings and international travel on Malaysia's COVID-19 epidemic trajectories using an augmented SEIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the clinical application value of chest CT quantitative pulmonary inflammation index (PII) in the evaluation of the course and treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. One hundred and eighteen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by RT-PCR were analyzed retrospectively. The correlation between chest CT PII, clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations during the entire hospitalization period was compared. The average age of the patients was 46.0  15 (range: 1C74) years. Of the 118 patients, 62 are male (52.5%) and 56 are female (47.5%). Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9C41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0C5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0C20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the most likely areas to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%); common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0C5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0C20). The residual lesions mainly presented as ground glass opacities (61.0%), and the main accompanying sign was linear opacities (59.3%). Based on chest CT, the median maximum PII of lungs was 30.0% (range: 0C97.5%), and the median PII after discharge in the patients excluding the two deaths was 12.5% (range: 0C53.0%). PII was significantly negatively correlated with the LYM count and significantly positively correlated with body temperature, LDH, CRP, and ESR. There was no significant correlation between the PII and the white blood cell count, but the grade of PII correlated well with the clinical classification. PII can be used to monitor the severity and the treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia, provide help for clinical classification, assist in treatment plan adjustments and aid assessments for discharge.","output":"The role of chest CT quantitative pulmonary inflammatory index in the evaluation of the course and treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First responders may have high SARS-CoV-2 infection risks due to working with potentially infected patients in enclosed spaces. The study objective was to estimate infection risks per transport for first responders and quantify how first responder use of N95 respirators and patient use of cloth masks can reduce these risks. A model was developed for two Scenarios: an ambulance transport with a patient actively emitting a virus in small aerosols that could lead to airborne transmission (Scenario 1) and a subsequent transport with the same respirator or mask use conditions, an uninfected patient; and remaining airborne SARS-CoV-2 and contaminated surfaces due to aerosol deposition from the previous transport (Scenario 2). A compartmental Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the dispersion and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent infection risks for first responders, accounting for variability and uncertainty in input parameters (i.e., transport duration, transfer efficiencies, SARS-CoV-2 emission rates from infected patients, etc.). Infection risk distributions and changes in concentration on hands and surfaces over time were estimated across sub-Scenarios of first responder respirator use and patient cloth mask use. For Scenario 1, predicted mean infection risks were reduced by 69%, 48%, and 85% from a baseline risk (no respirators or face masks used) of 2.9  10-2  3.4  10-2 when simulated first responders wore respirators, the patient wore a cloth mask, and when first responders and the patient wore respirators or a cloth mask, respectively. For Scenario 2, infection risk reductions for these same Scenarios were 69%, 50%, and 85%, respectively (baseline risk of 7.2  10-3  1.0  10-2). While aerosol transmission routes contributed more to viral dose in Scenario 1, our simulations demonstrate the ability of face masks worn by patients to additionally reduce surface transmission by reducing viral deposition on surfaces. Based on these simulations, we recommend the patient wear a face mask and first responders wear respirators, when possible, and disinfection should prioritize high use equipment.","output":"Respirators, face masks, and their risk reductions via multiple transmission routes for first responders within an ambulance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 in the United States led most states to close or severely limit the capacity of their early child-care and education (ECE) programs.

The general public are faced with a plethora of misinformation regarding COVID-19 and the readability of online information has an impact on their understanding of the disease. The accessibility of online healthcare information relating to COVID-19 is unknown. We sought to evaluate the readability of online information relating to COVID-19 in four English speaking regions: Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, and compare readability of website source provenance and regional origin. METHODS: The Google? search engine was used to collate the first 20 webpage URLs for three individual searches for 'COVID', 'COVID-19', and 'coronavirus' from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (FKG) Score, Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) score were calculated to assess the readability. RESULTS: There were poor levels of readability webpages reviewed, with only 17.2% of webpages at a universally readable level. There was a significant difference in readability between the different webpages based on their information source (p < 0.01). Public Health organisations and Government organisations provided the most readable COVID-19 material, while digital media sources were significantly less readable. There were no significant differences in readability between regions. CONCLUSION: Much of the general public have relied on online information during the pandemic. Information on COVID-19 should be made more readable, and those writing webpages and information tools should ensure universal accessibility is considered in their production.

While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases).

Aims To develop a framework for detailed near-real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out; to describe trends and variation in coverage by geographic area, and between key clinical and demographic patient groups. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we used routine clinical data from 23.4 million adults to conduct a retrospective cohort study of comprehensive electronic health record data in NHS England, using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform which covers approximately 40% of the general population in England with weekly data updates. We developed algorithms to identify key demographic and clinical sub-groups within this population and generated descriptive statistics on proportion of eligible patients receiving the vaccine among key Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) target groups. Results Between December 8th and January 13th 961,580 people out of 23.4m in our dataset received a COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,160,062 patients aged 80 or over and not living in a care home (currently targeted by JCVI) 476,375 had been vaccinated in total (41.1%). We observed a substantial divergence in vaccination by ethnicity within this group (White 42.5% vaccinated, Black 20.5%) and across rankings of deprivation (least deprived 44.7%, most deprived 37.9%). Patients with pre-existing medical conditions were equally likely, or more likely, to have received a vaccine across most co-morbidity groups with two exceptions: severe mental illness (30.3% vaccinated) and learning disability (28.1%). We identify substantial variation in vaccination among the over-80s between Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs; Range 12%-74%); lower vaccination rates among ethnic minority and deprived groups was observed in most but not all STPs. In the 70-79 age cohort 74,108 people (3.6%) had been vaccinated. 378,921 vaccine recipients under 70 and not identifiably resident in a care home were presumed to be health or social care workers; 32,174 recipients were identified as older aged care home residents (33.2% coverage). Of all those vaccinated, 169,472 had received a second dose (17.6%). Conclusions The NHS in England has rapidly delivered mass vaccination. We were able to deploy a data monitoring framework across small clinical subgroups using linked patient-level NHS data on 23.4 million people with very short delays from vaccine administration to completed analysis. Targeted activity may be needed to address lower vaccination rates observed among certain key groups: ethnic minorities, people living in areas of higher deprivation, and those with severe mental illness or learning disabilities. However we note that this data is only from the first preliminary weeks of the vaccination programme. Variation in vaccination coverage between groups and regions will have many complex drivers, the figures presented in this manuscript require thoughtful interpretation to support a rapidly evolving NHS vaccination campaign; we are sharing local level data with national and regional NHS teams on request.

Although the risk for a severe disease course is low among children with COVID-19, symptoms may be exacerbated by underlying disease and/or immunosuppressive medication. We analysed clinical data from COVID-19 cases in among pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Germany reported to the BIKER registry. Objectives: This is an analysis of clinical data for 56 COVID-19 cases reported to the German BIKER registry from 29 German pediatric rheumatology centers and clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. Methods: The major task of the German BIKER (Biologics in Paediatric Rheumatology) Registry is surveillance of biologics used in pediatric rheumatology patients. Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, a survey was established to proactively interview all participating centers regarding the occurrence, presentation and outcome of SARS-CoV-2-infected children with rheumatic diseases. Initially, the interviews were conducted in weekly intervals, later bi-weekly. A standardized Adverse Event of Special Interest form was developed requesting biographic data, pre-treatment, current medication, data on clinical presentation, course, treatment and outcome of COVID-19 pediatric rheumatology patients. Results: In all, 56 patients with JIA and SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported (Table 1). Of these patients, 71% were 12 or more years old. At the time of infection, 41% of the patients received conventional DMARDs and 52% received biologics (Table 1). Forty-four patients (79%) received either a conventional DMARD or a biologic. Most patients had a polyarticular course of their JIA (57%). In 49 of the 56 cases (88%) COVID-19 was detected directly by PCR (n=46), by antigen test only (n=1) or an undisclosed method (n= 2). Six patients had detectable SARS-CoV2 antibodies and reported to have had typical symptoms. One patient tested negative but developed typical symptoms at approximately the same time a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was returned for a family member. Symptoms were reported in 43 of the 56 patients (77%): fever n=15, rhinitis n=14, cough n=12, headache n=10, loss of sense of taste and/or smell n=9, pharyngitis n=8, fatigue n=5, musculoskeletal pain n=5, GI symptoms n=2 (abdominal pain n=1, diarrhoea n=1), dizziness n=3, encephalitis/seizure/respiratory failure/death n=1. Thirteen patients (23%) were asymptomatic. A 3-year-old female patient initially diagnosed with systemic JIA developed intracranial oedema and respiratory failure. Her SARS-CoV2 PCR test was positive and pulmonary imaging displayed typical changes in lung texture. Before her SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient was treated with methotrexate and low-dose steroids. Unfortunately, she died three days following hospital admission. Genetic testing revealed an inborn immunodeficiency. Except for this one patient, all other cases were treated as outpatients and no deaths were reported. Conclusion: Apart from one patient with an inborn immunodeficiency who died from her COVID-19 infection, no case of hospitalization or severe COVID-19 was reported in our cohort of JIA patients. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, nearly 80% of patients in our cohort had been treated with conventional DMARD and/ or biologics.

We use mixed-effects models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Social isolation (distancing) significantly predicts poor mental health operationalized as coronavirus-induced distress (p < 0.01). At the aggregate level, average distress varies positively across countries with higher numbers of coronavirus-related deaths (p < 0.10) and more fragile state capacity (p < 0.05), while varying negatively across those with more stringent anti-coronavirus policies (p < 0.05). Finally, we report several cross-level interactions between social isolation and the total number of deaths (p = 0.025), policy stringency (p =0.065), state fragility (p = 0.061), and globalization index (p = 0.071).

Bitter taste receptor phenotype appears to be associated with the clinical course and symptom duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Objective: To evaluate the association between T2R phenotype and patient clinical course after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study was performed from July 1 through September 30, 2020, at a tertiary outpatient clinical practice and inpatient hospital in the United States among 1935 participants (patients and health care workers) with occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Exposure: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants underwent T2R38 phenotype taste testing to determine whether they were supertasters (those who experienced greater intensity of bitter tastes), tasters, or nontasters (those who experienced low intensity of bitter tastes or no bitter tastes) and underwent evaluation for lack of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and IgM and IgG testing. A group of participants was randomly selected for genotype analysis to correlate phenotype. Participants were followed up until confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via PCR testing. Phenotype of T2R38 was retested after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results were compared with clinical course. Results: A total of 1935 individuals (1101 women [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [13.9] years) participated in the study. Results of phenotype taste testing showed that 508 (26.3%) were supertasters, 917 (47.4%) were tasters, and 510 (26.4%) were nontasters. A total of 266 participants (13.7%) had positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 55 (20.7%) required hospitalization. Symptom duration among patients with positive results ranged from 0 to 48 days. Nontasters were significantly more likely than tasters and supertasters to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 10.1 [95% CI, 5.8-17.8]; P < .001), to be hospitalized once infected (odds ratio, 3.9 [1.5-10.2]; P = .006), and to be symptomatic for a longer duration (mean [SE] duration, 23.7 [0.5] days vs 13.5 [0.4] days vs 5.0 [0.6] days; P < .001). A total of 47 of 55 patients (85.5%) with COVID-19 who required inpatient admission were nontasters. Conversely, 15 of 266 patients (5.6%) with positive PCR test results were supertasters. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that T2R38 receptor allelic variants were associated with participants' innate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2. The T2R phenotype was associated with patients' clinical course after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nontasters were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the other 2 groups, suggesting enhanced innate immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Association Between Bitter Taste Receptor Phenotype and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the potential of replication-competent (E3-deleted) bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) as a delivery system for vaccine antigens in calves, we evaluated the ability of recombinant BAV-3 expressing different forms of of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) glycoprotein gD to protect against BHV-1 infection in calves that had pre-existing BAV-3 specific antibodies. Three- to four-month-old calves, vaccinated intranasally with recombinant BAV-3 expressing full-length gD (BAV3.E3gD) or a truncated version of gD (gDt) (BAV3.E3gDt), or with E3-deleted BAV-3 (BAV3.E3d; control), were challenged with BHV-1 strain 108.

AKI complicates COVID-19 management by making volume management and administering agents with renal clearance challenging tasks. Various reasons have been proposed for the development of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients, including multi-organ failure and pre-renal causes, drug toxicity, tubular injury, and invasion of proximal tube podocytes by SARS-CoV-2. Although the development of AKI is not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, several inconsistencies in the literature exist regarding incidence rate and risk factors of acute kidney injury among hospitalized patients. This can be attributed to ethnical variations and methodological differences of studies. Herein we report AKI incidence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Baqiyatallah Hospital in Iran and investigate associate factors that can lead to AKI and renal replacement therapy in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated medical records and laboratory data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from September 2020 until the end of November. COVID-19 infection was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and only patients with Positive PCR for COVID-19 were included. Furthermore, patients with missing data and unknown past medical history were excluded from this study, and a total of 459 patients were selected. The KDIGO criteria for acute kidney injury were used for evaluating kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. ICU admission and dialysis were according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education on ICU admission and renal replacement therapy in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Of 459 patients with the criteria who were admitted to the hospital (244 male, 213 female, with an average age of 59.57 with SD 14.3), 75 patients (16%) developed acute kidney injury in the course of the disease. The mortality rate in patients with AKI (44%) was significantly higher than other patients (9%). The development of the AKI was significantly associated with the risk of ICU admission and the severe forms of the disease. Furthermore, it was observed that the patients who developed AKI was significantly older and male gender, diabetes (DM), Hypertension (HTN), and Previous history of Chronic kidney disease(CKD) was also significantly associated with developing AKI in COVID-19 patients. Chronic heart failure and ischemic heart disease increased the odds of developing AKI, but it was not significant enough to come up with a conclusion. It was observed that from 75 patients who developed AKI, 22 patients (29%) required renal replacement therapy. Of 22 patients who need dialysis, 14 patients did not survive (mortality rate=63%). The previous history of kidney disease increases the risk of dialysis due to AKI, while no significant association was found between age, gender, DM, HTN, and heart disease with the need for dialysis. CONCLUSION: Results of our study indicate that acute kidney injury can be a major obstacle in managing COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, previous history of CKD, HTN, and DM should be admitted to the hospital and monitored closely to prevent unfortunate outcomes of this disease.","output":"MO406 ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY AND RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS: A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY FROM IRAN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The given paper elaborates on the main models and approaches for the innovation development applicable to IT companies in the context of Covid-19 pandemic impact for short and medium terms.

In order to understand the nucleic acid degradability of Cu and its alloy surfaces, we developed a new in vitro method to quantitatively evaluate it by a swab method under a dry condition and compared it with that of commercially available antibacterial materials such as antibacterial stainless steel, pure silver, and antibacterial resins. As a result, only Cu and its alloys showed continuous degradation of nucleic acids for up to 6 h of contact time. The nucleic acid degradability levels of the Cu alloys and other antibacterial materials correlate to their antibacterial activities evaluated by a film method referring to JIS Z 2801:2012 for Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Nucleic acid degradation by copper (I) and (II) chlorides was confirmed at the ranges over 10 mM and 1C20 mM, respectively, suggesting that the copper ion release may be responsible for the degradation of the nucleic acids on Cu and its alloy surfaces.

Japan is known to have relatively smaller number of its infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by the decade of age and sex. RESULTS: There were 33 positive IgG among 1000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3C4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (population: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934C69,868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was calculated 2.7% (95%CI: 1.8C3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40,999 (95%CI: 27,333C59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858-fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City.

Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined. KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 g ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Unfractionated heparin inhibits live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity at therapeutically relevant concentrations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aedes aegypti (Linn.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) are widespread vector mosquitoes responsible for the transmission of various disease-causing viruses to human including dengue virus (DENV). India is endemic for dengue disease and both of these vector mosquitoes are well established throughout India. Since, Aedes mosquitoes breeds in containers, WHO recommends to do a regular immature surveillance and implement appropriate control measures. Owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic, most of the countries have implemented continuous shutdown/lockdown, which affected the routine Aedes surveillance and vector control measures. In India, the first nation-wide lockdown was implemented on 24(th), March 2020. As of now, Government of India has extended the lockdown till 30th, June 2020. In the present study, two rounds of Aedes surveillance was carried out in two localities of Bangalore City (urban) of Karnataka State, India during the COVID-19 lockdown days and results were compared with pre- lockdown surveillance data to assess the impact of lockdown on Aedes larval indices, breeding habitats and dengue vector control programme. The recorded house index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were 6.6 and 9.3 in K.P. Agrahara and 4.0 and 5.3 in Palace Guttahalli during pre-lockdown survey. The house index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were found to be increased to 26.6 and 34.6 in K.P. Agrahara and 21.3 and 28.0 in Palace Guttahalli during the COVID-19 lockdown second survey. Aedes immature density has drastically increased in both the localities due to temporarily discontinued Aedes surveillance, larval control activities like source reduction and anti-larval measures during COVID-19 lockdown.

METHODS Training programmes of all general hospitals in Israel for managing a pandemic influenza were evaluated. Spearman's  correlation was used to analyse the relationship between training scores and level of knowledge of medical personnel with performance in an avian flu exercise. Hospital preparedness levels were evaluated at two time points and Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if overall preparedness scores improved over time. RESULTS Evaluation of training programmes for pandemic influenza showed high to very high scores in most hospitals (mean 85, SD 22). Significant correlations between training and performance in the exercise were noted for: implementation of training programmes 0.91, P = 0.000; designating personnel for training 0.87, P = 0.000; content of training 0.61, P = 0.001; and training materials 0.36, P = 0.05. Overall reliability of the evaluation scores was 0.82 and reliability for two of the sub-scales was: implementation of the programme 0.78; and designating personnel for training 0.37. No significant correlation was found between level of knowledge and performance in the exercise. DISCUSSION Training programmes for hospital personnel for pandemic flu have a significant role in improving performance in case of pandemic flu.

Existing automatic and interactive segmentation models for medical images only use data from a single time point (static). However, valuable segmentation information from previous time points is often not used to aid the segmentation of a patient's follow-up scans. Also, fully automatic segmentation techniques frequently produce results that would need further editing for clinical use. In this work, we propose a new single network model for interactive segmentation that fully utilizes all available past information to refine the segmentation of follow-up scans. In the first segmentation round, our model takes 3D volumes of medical images from two-time points (target and reference) as concatenated slices with the additional reference time point segmentation as a guide to segment the target scan. In subsequent segmentation refinement rounds, user feedback in the form of scribbles that correct the segmentation and the target's previous segmentation results are additionally fed into the model. This ensures that the segmentation information from previous refinement rounds is retained.

This capping process is carried out by several nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded in the viral genome. The methylation itself is performed consecutively by two methyltransferases, nsp14 and nsp16, which interact with nsp10 protein acting as a co-factor. The nsp14 protein also carries the exonuclease domain, which also serves as a part of the proofreading system during the replication of the large RNA genome. The available crystal structures suggest that the concomitant interaction between these three proteins is impossible due to the structural clash, and it is generally accepted that the nsp16 and nsp14 bind with the nsp10 separately. Here, we show that nsp14, nsp10, and nsp16 form a methylation complex despite the odds. Due to spatial proximity, this interaction is beneficial for forming mature capped viral mRNA. Further, it modulates the exonuclease activity of nsp14, protecting the viral RNA at the replication site. Our findings show that nsp14 is more amenable to allosteric regulation and may serve as a molecular target for the therapy.","output":"Despite the odds: formation of the SARS-CoV-2 methylation complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared with other mammals, bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species and do not demonstrate signs of disease on infection with these viruses.

METHODS: RCTs investigating treatment with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced ESCC were selected. The hazard ratio (HR) and the odds ratio were used to compare the treatment effect on survival outcomes and tumor response, respectively, for immunotherapy-based regimens compared with standard chemotherapy, overall and according to geographic region or treatment line. We carried out a subgroup analysis comparing patients with CPS 10 or <10 and the evidence for treatment effect was evaluated by interaction test. RESULTS: A total of 5257 patients and 10 RCTs were included. Overall, the HR for overall survival benefit with immunotherapy-based regimens was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.76] compared with chemotherapy alone; such effect was independent from geographical region (Asia versus rest of the world) and treatment line (upfront versus second/further lines). The HR for progression-free survival benefit and the odds ratio for overall response rate increase were 0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.93) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.22-1.83), respectively.

METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at our university-affiliated NYC hospital from 3/10/20 through 4/13/20 with follow-up to 5/1/20. Our primary endpoint was hospitalization rate among patients with confirmed COVID-19 compared with the regional population based on race. Our secondary endpoint survival to discharge among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. NYC Department of Health data were used to calculate hospitalization odds ratios. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare categorial and continuous variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression and predictive analysis were used to investigate our endpoints further. RESULTS: Our cohort of 734 patients included 355 women (48.4%), 372 Blacks (50.7%), 214 Whites (29.2%), and 92 Hispanics (12.5%) in our analysis. Blacks were nearly twice as likely as Whites to require hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR 1.89, 95% CI, 1.59-2.24, p < 0.001). Hispanics were also more likely to suffer in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with Whites (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21-2.80; p = 0.005).

Periodontitis, the most prevalent disease that leads to tooth loss, is caused by infection by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontitis is also a risk factor for pneumonia and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presumably because of the aspiration of saliva contaminated with periodontopathic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Patients with these diseases have increased rates of COVID-19 aggravation and mortality. Because periodontopathic bacteria have been isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, periodontitis may be a risk factor for COVID-19 aggravation. However, the molecular links between periodontitis and COVID-19 have not been clarified. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (CSF) upregulated the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in A549 alveolar epithelial cells.

However, how these shifts affect microbial interactions and function is poorly understood. Unraveling such microbial community responses is key to understand their environmental distribution and resilience under current and future disturbances. Here, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate microbial community structure and transcriptional responses to prolonged ammonium deprivation, and sulfide and nitric oxide toxicity stresses in a controlled bioreactor system mimicking coastal sediment conditions. Ca. Nitrobium versatile, identified in this study as a sulfide-oxidizing denitrifier, became a rare community member upon ammonium removal. The ANaerobic Methanotroph (ANME) Ca. Methanoperedens nitroreducens showed remarkable resilience to both experimental conditions, dominating transcriptional activity of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). During the ammonium removal experiment, increased DNRA was unable to sustain anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) activity.

Though there are established communication systems in European Member States (MS), public health events in the maritime sector challenge authorities and stakeholders. METHODS: Guidelines for inter-country communication developed by the joint action were tested via a 1-day web-based multi-sectorial, discussion-based table-top exercise (TTE) for ports at European level. Two outbreak scenarios (gastroenteritis and COVID-19) on passenger ships in separate regions (Mediterranean, North Sea) were acted out consecutively. RESULTS: Thirty participants and 63 observers from 20 MS, cruise ships, international and European institutions took part in the TTE. The TTE identified two different information flows: (1) authorities at local level implementing public health measures on ships share information with the next and previous ports of call, either directly or via national level authorities using different platforms depending on the event without clearly predefined criteria and (2) the ship captain sends health information to the next port of call (via the National Single Window or Email or Telephone or other means). Relying on communication via emails and telephones however, has limitations: a) limited access, b) no central data storage, c) historical data unavailable. Lack of communication channels for feedback to the ship and of coordinating and closing an event was evident.

This study was conducted in 2020 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of external nasal dilator strips (ENDS) coupled with N95 respirators in a sample of community hospital emergency department personnel. METHODS: After obtaining written consent, the authors tested participants response to exercise (i.e., walking up 10 flights of stairs) while wearing an N95 respirator, both with and without an ENDS. The authors measured participants heart rate and respiratory effort responses over four minutes following their exercise trial. A convenience sample of these personnel also repeated their respirator fit testing while wearing an ENDS with the N95 style they had previously been fitted for. RESULTS: A total of N = 50 participants were enrolled. Peak heart rate while wearing an ENDS was 125 beats per minute (BPM) with the ENDS versus 130 BPM without (p = 0.21). The Borg Exertion Score while wearing an ENDS peaked at 13 with the ENDS versus 14 without (p = 0.08). However, when subjects were surveyed before and after the trial upon whether they would consider using an ENDS beneath their N95 using a scale of 1-5, their interest in this significantly increased (p = 0.004).

However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group)  (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed% expected)/ % expected] x 100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p < .00001), as was percentage observed  percentage expected (p < .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults.

Here, we investigated the associations between influenza vaccination and risk for acute myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism during the 2009 pandemic in Norway, when vaccination was recommended to all adults. METHODS: Using national registers, we studied all vaccinated Norwegian individuals who suffered AMI, stroke, or pulmonary embolism from May 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010. We defined higher-risk individuals as those using anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-thrombotic, pulmonary or cardiovascular medications (i.e. individuals to whom vaccination was routinely recommended); all other individuals were regarded as having lower-risk. We estimated incidence rate ratios with 95% CI using conditional Poisson regression in the pre-defined risk periods up to 180 days following vaccination compared to an unexposed time-period, with adjustment for season or daily temperature. RESULTS: Overall, we observed lower risk for cardiovascular events following influenza vaccination. When stratified by baseline risk, we observed lower risk across all three outcomes in association with vaccination among higher-risk individuals. In this subgroup, relative risks were 0.72 (0.59C0.88) for AMI, 0.77 (0.59C0.99) for stroke, and 0.73 (0.45C1.19) for pulmonary embolism in the period 1C14 days following vaccination when compared to the background period.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the level of work engagement of Spanish nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was carried out. The sample consisted of 510 active nurses from all over Spain, without age exclusion, who voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. Work engagement was assessed with the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) questionnaire, through an online questionnaire and non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The results showed a mean age of 45.9 years (SD = 10.7 years), most of them women (78.1%), and 58.5% were in primary care. The mean score for the UWES-9 questionnaire was 4.6 points (SD = 1.35). The categorical regression analysis performed revealed an R2 value of 0.75 and a significance of p < 0.01 in the sex, type of unit, and training variables.

While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described. This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings. The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019. The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters.

Both agglutinin and neutralizing post vaccination antibodies levels were measured respectively by the microscopic sera agglutination with live antigens test (MAT) and the in vitro leptospira growth inhibition test (GIT). Sera collections were performed each 30 days during four months after the first vaccination. Non vaccinated control group animals presented no agglutinating antibodies against Canicola serovar during the whole experiment.

There is not much evidence assessing the knowledge of dental surgeons regarding COVID-19. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 among dental surgeons of Nepal. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among registered dental surgeons of Nepal. Ethical approval was obtained. Consent was taken, and knowledge on COVID-19 was assessed via a pre-tested structured questionnaire using Google form. The form was emailed to the participants. Descriptive analysis was performed using frequency, percentage, median and inter-quartile range. Man-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis tests were carried out to see the difference in knowledge score. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Total 227 dental surgeons responded to the questionnaire (male: 46.4%; female: 53.7%). Almost two-third ( 65.2% ) of the respondents were B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) graduates. Only 29.1% worked in the government hospitals. 17.6% were currently involved in COVID-19 management. Of the participants, 87.7% knew about the condition of the requirement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) but only 29.1% could correctly answer the framed question for PPE. The median knowledge score calculated was 14.0 (8.0C18.0). The bivariate analysis showed a statistically significant difference in knowledge score among the age group 30 years and < 30 years (p = 0.013); M.D.S.

DesignCross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and school closures. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. ParticipantsParticipants included children and adolescents between ages 6-16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric disorder or chronic disorder. AnalysisData was collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) = 4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Childrens Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, {varphi}c=-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender, and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels. ConclusionA large proportion of children had elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, suggesting a need for measures to engage children in healthy habits to protect childrens mental health and continuous monitoring of children during such scenarios.

On the one hand, it has created opportunities, especially with the growth of collaborative technologies. On the other hand, many firms have reduced their IT budgets owing to the ongoing recession. This study explores how IT firms have assessed the risk of the pandemic in the early days and informed capital market participants. In addition, it examines the impact of such online disclosures on information asymmetry. Design/methodology/approach The authors analysed annual reports of publicly listed firms in the USA filed on the Securities and Exchange Commission website in 2020 and examined whether the disclosure scenario of technology firms was different from that of the other industries. Moreover, the risk sentiment of COVID-19-related disclosures was assessed by employing text analytics. Information asymmetry was measured using the bid-ask spread. Findings Overall, it was found that IT services firms were less likely to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic in their annual reports. Interestingly, it was observed that technology firms that chose to communicate about the pandemic had a lower incidence of words related to risks. Furthermore, communicating about COVID-19 in annual reports calms investors and improves the information asymmetry situation about the firm. Variation in the severity of the pandemic and the responses of state governments was controlled for by employing state-fixed effects in the empirical models.

In addition, there remains an ever-increasing need to quantitatively evaluate the immune response to develop vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Here, we report an analytical method for the rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in human serum by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). A recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein labeled with HiLyte Fluor 647 (F-RBD) was prepared and used for FPIA. When the anti-RBD antibody in human serum binds to F-RBD, the degree of polarization (P) increases by suppressing the rotational diffusion of F-RBD. The measurement procedure required only mixing a reagent containing F-RBD with serum sample and measuring the P value with a portable fluorescence polarization analyzer after 15 min incubation. We evaluated analytical performance of the developed FPIA system using 30 samples: 20 COVID-19 positive sera and 10 negative sera. The receiver operating characteristic curve drawn with the obtained results showed that this FPIA system had high accuracy for discriminating COVID-19 positive or negative serum (AUC = 0.965). The total measurement time was about 20 min, and the serum volume required for measurement was 0.25 L. Therefore, we successfully developed the FPIA system that enables rapid and easy quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

We conducted a systematic scoping review of the best available evidence regarding dietary intake of Malaysian pregnant women, and the associations of maternal diet, anthropometry, and nutrition-related co-morbidities with the infants birth weight (IBW). The study objectives were to examine: (1) the adequacy of micronutrient intake among pregnant women; and (2) the association of maternal factors (anthropometry, diet, plasma glucose and blood pressure) during pregnancy with IBW. METHODS: Eleven search engines such as Proquest, EbscoHost, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, MyJournal, BookSC and Inter Library Loan with Medical Library Group were extensively searched to identify the primary articles. Three reviewers independently screened the abstracts and full articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Extracted data included details about the population characteristics, study methods and key findings related to the review objectives. Seventeen studies published from 1972 to 2021 were included, following the PRISMA-ScR guideline. RESULTS: Studies showed that maternal micronutrient intakes including calcium, iron, vitamin D, folic acid, and niacin fell short of the national recommendations. Increased maternal fruit intake was also associated with increased birth weight. Factors associated with fetal macrosomia included high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), excess gestational weight gain (GWG) and high blood glucose levels. Low pre-pregnancy BMI, inadequate GWG, intake of confectioneries and condiments, and high blood pressure were associated with low birth weight.

An ad hoc questionnaire was administered. The participants were 1046 people (48.57% male and 51.43% female) and the average age of 40 (DT 13.35 years). Regarding the practice of physical activity, a significant decrease in intensity and quantity stands out (p .001), and a modification of the type of physical activity performed, going from cardiovascular sports and muscular fitness to soft gymnastics and flexibility practices. The total percentage of people who did no physical activity at all, increased. In addition, although more free time was available, people in ERTE situation significantly decreased their amount of physical activity performed (p .001). These results allow us to conclude that confinement has meant a modification of physical activity practice habits and a decrease in the recommended values of healthy healthy, and therefore has had implications on health and quality of life. This information will help to understand these new behaviors in order for managers to implement innovative strategies to reactivate the return to previous levels of physical activity, its increase and, in short, the reactivation of the sports sector. ? 2021 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

This is the case during the current pandemic of COVID-19. This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This results in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are recommended during the pandemic, preventing the spread of the disease. However, these devices entail different complications (such as capture quality) that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult and suggest the necessity for computer-aided diagnosis methodologies despite the scarcity of samples available to do so. To solve this problem, we propose a methodology that allows to adapt the knowledge from a well-known domain with a high number of samples to a new domain with a significantly reduced number and greater complexity. We took advantage of a pre-trained segmentation model from brain magnetic resonance imaging of a unrelated pathology and performed two stages of knowledge transfer to obtain a robust system able to segment lung regions from portable X-ray devices despite the scarcity of samples and lesser quality. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy of 0.9761  0.0100 for patients with COVID-19, 0.9801  0.0104 for normal patients and 0.9769  0.0111 for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.","output":"Multi-stage transfer learning for lung segmentation using portable X-ray devices for patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks) has a multifactorial etiology with still incompletely identified pathways. Amniotic fluid is a biofluid with great potential for insights into the feto-maternal milieu. It is rich in metabolites, and metabolic consequences of inflammation is yet researched only to a limited extent. Metabolomic profiling provides opportunities to identify potential biomarkers of inflammatory conditioned pregnancy complications such as spontaneous preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform metabolomic profiling of amniotic fluid from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies in the mid-trimester to identify potential biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration at delivery. A secondary aim was to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers of spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic women. METHOD: A nested case-control study was performed within a larger cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis at 14-19 gestational weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden. Medical records were used to obtain clinical data and delivery outcome variables. Amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery (n = 37) were matched with amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous delivery at term (n = 37). Amniotic fluid samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate random forest analyses were used for data processing. A secondary targeted analysis was performed, aiming to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers in women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis did not distinguish the samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery from those with a subsequent term delivery. Neither was the metabolic profile associated with gestational duration at delivery. Potential metabolic biomarker candidates were identified from four publications by two different research groups relating mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolomes to spontaneous PTD, of which fifteen markers were included in the secondary analysis. None of these were replicated.

To meet this, the UMN CTSI created the Community Mentor for Scholars Program with goals to: 1) train Scholars to engage stakeholders;and 2) provide community with formal mentoring training and linkages to researchers at UMN. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The CM Program was implemented over 12 months and includes four components. One, Scholars were trained in stakeholder identification and working with a community mentor (CM) through two seminars presented by expert faculty and staff. Two, CMs were identified, recruited, and matched with Scholars through a collaborative effort of our CTSI Education and Community Engagement cores. Three, Scholars and CMs learned about the program from a 2-hour Kick-Off event. Four, CMs and Scholars each completed four online modules developed through an NCATS administrative supplement. Scholar-CM pairs met at least four times to plan and hold a bi-directional Community Conversation with an audience of key stakeholders convened by the CM. The CM Program was evaluated through in-person interviews. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2019-2020, CTSI initiated the pilot program with four KL2 Scholar - CM pairs. Two pairs did not complete the program due to time pressures, a parental leave, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback from the two Scholar - CM pairs was positive, specifically: CMs reported the training modules were useful, resulting in better understanding of CTSI research programs and increased capacity to mentor Scholars felt the interactions with CMs positively impacted their future research Mentors supported experiential learning, offered insight on community perspectives, and successfully facilitated community engagement principles.

However, the effect of quadriceps tendon stiffness on walking speed remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the influence of the amount of change in quadriceps tendon stiffness on the degree of change in walking speed before and after TKA. Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients who underwent TKA for knee osteoarthritis participated in this study (median age: 74.0 years (interquartile range: 64.5C75.8)). Shear-wave elastography was deployed to measure quadriceps tendon stiffness using Youngs modulus. A motion analysis system was used to assess kinematic parameters and walking speed. Participants knee circumference, range of motion, extension strength, one-leg standing time, walking pain level, and activity level were measured preoperatively and one year after TKA, and changes in values were calculated. We used path analysis to clarify the influence of the amount of change in the quadriceps tendon Youngs modulus on the change in walking speed. Results: The quadriceps tendon Youngs modulus negatively affected the knee flexion angle during swing (standardized partial regression coefficients () = ?0.513, p = 0.042). The knee flexion angle during swing positively affected step length ( = 0.586, p = 0.017). Step length positively affected cadence ( = 0.733, p = 0.001). Step length and cadence positively affected walking speed ( = 0.563, p < 0.001,  = 0.502, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The amount of change in the quadriceps tendon Youngs modulus may affect the degree of change in walking speed after TKA through the amount of change in the knee flexion angle during swing, step length, and cadence. Clinically, reducing quadriceps tendon stiffness can be addressed in rehabilitation programs to increase walking speed after TKA.","output":"Influence of the Amount of Change in Quadriceps Tendon Youngs Modulus on Amount of Change in Walking Speed before and after Total Knee Arthroplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already had a significant disruptive impact on the society, posing challenges to the provision of education across the world.

Interestingly, they had opposing effects on the CFR: inverse correlation by V197, proportional correlation by G8V. East Asians have higher V197M and lower G8V allele frequencies than Europeans, possibly endowing resistance against SARS-CoV-2.

As there are diverse risk factors and causes, no one strategy will prevent all cerebral palsy. Therefore, there is a need to systematically consider all potentially relevant interventions for their contribution to prevention. OBJECTIVES To summarise the evidence from Cochrane reviews regarding the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions for preventing cerebral palsy. METHODS We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 7 August 2016, for reviews of antenatal or intrapartum interventions reporting on cerebral palsy. Two authors assessed reviews for inclusion, extracted data, assessed review quality, using AMSTAR and ROBIS, and quality of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. We organised reviews by topic, and summarised findings in text and tables. We categorised interventions as effective (high-quality evidence of effectiveness); possibly effective (moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness); ineffective (high-quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); and no conclusions possible (low- to very low-quality evidence). MAIN RESULTS We included 15 Cochrane reviews. A further 62 reviews pre-specified the outcome cerebral palsy in their methods, but none of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported this outcome. The included reviews were high quality and at low risk of bias. They included 279 RCTs; data for cerebral palsy were available from 27 (10%) RCTs, involving 32,490 children. They considered interventions for: treating mild to moderate hypertension (two) and pre-eclampsia (two); diagnosing and preventing fetal compromise in labour (one); preventing preterm birth (four); preterm fetal maturation or neuroprotection (five); and managing preterm fetal compromise (one). Quality of evidence ranged from very low to high. Effective interventions: high-quality evidence of effectiveness There was a reduction in cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.87; five RCTs; 6145 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of harm There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children born to mothers in preterm labour with intact membranes who received any prophylactic antibiotics versus no antibiotics (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.34; one RCT; 3173 children). There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children, who as preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, were born immediately compared with those for whom birth was deferred (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02; one RCT; 507 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of lack of effectiveness There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received repeat doses of corticosteroids compared with a single course (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50; four RCTs; 3800 children). No conclusions possible: low- to very low-quality evidence Low-quality evidence found there was a possible reduction in cerebral palsy for children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation compared with placebo (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03; five RCTs; 904 children). There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy with interventionist care for severe pre-eclampsia versus expectant care (RR 6.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 48.14; one RCT; 262 children); magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia versus placebo (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.26; one RCT; 2895 children); continuous cardiotocography for fetal assessment during labour versus intermittent auscultation (average RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.63; two RCTs; 13,252 children); prenatal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth versus placebo (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.48; one RCT; 274 children); and betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour versus placebo (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.63; one RCT; 246 children).Very low-quality found no clear difference for the presence of cerebral palsy with any antihypertensive drug (oral beta-blockers) for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.01; one RCT; 110 children); magnesium sulphate for prevention of preterm birth versus other tocolytic agents (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.51; one RCT; 106 children); and vitamin K and phenobarbital prior to preterm birth for prevention of neonatal periventricular haemorrhage versus placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76; one RCT; 299 children). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane reviews on the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions on cerebral palsy, and can be used by researchers, funding bodies, policy makers, clinicians and consumers to aid decision-making and evidence translation. We recommend that readers consult the included Cochrane reviews to formally assess other benefits or harms of included interventions, including impacts on risk factors for cerebral palsy (such as the reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage for preterm babies following exposure to antenatal corticosteroids).Magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for fetal neuroprotection can prevent cerebral palsy. Prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, and immediate rather than deferred birth of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, may increase the risk of cerebral palsy. Repeat doses compared with a single course of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth do not clearly impact the risk of cerebral palsy.Cerebral palsy is rarely diagnosed at birth, has diverse risk factors and causes, and is diagnosed in approximately one in 500 children. To date, only a small proportion of Cochrane reviews assessing antenatal and intrapartum interventions have been able to report on this outcome. There is an urgent need for long-term follow-up of RCTs of interventions addressing risk factors for cerebral palsy, and consideration of the use of relatively new interim assessments (including the General Movements Assessment). Such RCTs must be rigorous in their design, and aim for consistency in cerebral palsy outcome measurement and reporting to facilitate pooling of data, to focus research efforts on prevention.","output":"Antenatal and intrapartum interventions for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients whose lungs are compromised due to various respiratory health concerns require mechanical ventilation for support in breathing. Different mechanical ventilation settings are selected depending on the patients lung condition, and the selection of these parameters depends on the observed patient response and experience of the clinicians involved. To support this decision-making process for clinicians, good prediction models are always beneficial in improving the setting accuracy, reducing treatment error, and quickly weaning patients off the ventilation support. In this study, we developed a machine learning model for estimation of the mechanical ventilation parameters for lung health. The model is based on inverse mapping of artificial neural networks with the Graded Particle Swarm Optimizer. In this new variant, we introduced grouping and hierarchy in the swarm in addition to the general rules of particle swarm optimization to further improve its prediction performance of the mechanical ventilation parameters. The machine learning model was trained and tested using clinical data from canine and feline patients at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine. Our model successfully generated a range of parameter values for the mechanical ventilation applied on test data, with the average prediction values over multiple trials close to the target values. Overall, the developed machine learning model should be able to predict the mechanical ventilation settings for various respiratory conditions for patients survival once the relevant data are available.","output":"Mechanical Ventilator Parameter Estimation for Lung Health through Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The evidence has shown that SARS CoV-2 infected patients with comorbidities are more likely to have severe disease sequel and mortality. In SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients risks associated with other underlying comorbidities might vary from those in non-cancer SARS CoV-2 infected patients. The relative impact of different underlying health conditions among patients with cancer and SARS CoV-2 infection remains yet to be explored. This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of comorbidities among cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection and their impact on mortality. METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of science were searched for articles published between 9th July 2019 to July 8th 2020.Studies of cancer patients (>18 years) with diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection, published in English were included. A random-effects modelling for the meta-analyses was applied to assess the pooled prevalence and odds ratio for mortality due to comorbidities in SARS CoV-2 infected cancer patients. RESULTS: Total 31studies with 4086 SARS-CoV-2 infectedcancer patientsmet the inclusion criteria. Most prevalent co-morbidities in cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection were hypertension [42.3% (95%CI:37.5- 47.0)], diabetes [17.8% (95% CI: 15.3-20.4)] and cardiovascular diseases [16.7% (95%CI:12.9-20.4)].The risk of mortality (pOR) was significantly higher in individuals with hypertension[1.6(95%CI 1.24-2.00)], cardiovascular diseases [2.2 (95%CI 1.49- 3.27)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [1.4(95% CI 1.05-2.00)] and diabetes [1.35(95%CI 1.06-1.73)]. CONCLUSION: Our results indicates that the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients is affected by preexisting non-cancer comorbidities. By identifying the comorbidities predictive for mortality, clinicians can better stratify the risk of cancer patients presenting with SARS-COV-2, on their initial contact with health services.<br />.","output":"Impact of Underlying Comorbidities on Mortality in SARS-COV-2 Infected Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports the case of a woman with tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma and the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

The results show that the accuracy of the model considering earnings management factors is improved from 65% to 70%. In the process of modeling, this paper uses the logistic regression model to further modify the model. The empirical results show that the accuracy of the model can be improved from 70% to 75%. When using the forward neural network model based on particle swarm optimization to make an empirical analysis of financial early warning of listed companies, adding quantitative indicators of earnings management can improve the accuracy of the model. In the demonstration, the correction of logistic regression model can also improve the accuracy of the particle swarm neural network financial early warning model.

EVs are nanometer-to micrometer-sized spherical particles that are enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer and are secreted by most cell types. EVs reflect the physiological cell of origin in terms of their molecular composition and biophysical characteristics, and they accumulate in blood even when released from remote organs or tissues, while protecting their cargo from degradation. The molecular components (e.g., proteins, miRNAs) and biophysical characteristics (e.g., size, concentration) of blood EVs have been studied as biomarkers of cancers and neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and cardiovascular diseases. However, most biomarker studies do not address the problem of contaminants in EV isolates from blood plasma, and how these might affect downstream EV analysis. Indeed, nonphysiological EVs, protein aggregates, lipoproteins and viruses share many molecular and/or biophysical characteristics with EVs, and can therefore co-isolate with EVs from blood plasma. Consequently, isolation and downstream analysis of EVs from blood plasma remain a unique challenge, with important impacts on the outcomes of biomarker studies. To help improve rigor, reproducibility, and reliability of EV biomarker studies, we describe here the major contaminants of EV isolates from blood plasma, and we report on how different EV isolation methods affect their levels, and how contaminants that remain can affect the interpretation of downstream EV analysis.","output":"Blood Nanoparticles C Influence on Extracellular Vesicle Isolation and Characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box polypeptide 5 (DDX5), also called p68, is a prototypical member of the large ATP-dependent RNA helicases family and is known to participate in all aspects of RNA metabolism ranging from transcription to translation, RNA decay, and miRNA processing.

This study addresses the lack of transparency by leveraging Elsevier article metadata and provides the first publisher-level study of hybrid OA uptake and invoicing. Our results show that Elsevier's hybrid OA uptake has grown steadily but slowly from 2015-2019, doubling the number of hybrid OA articles published per year and increasing the share of OA articles in Elsevier's hybrid journals from 2.6% to 3.7% of all articles. Further, we find that most hybrid OA articles were invoiced directly to authors, followed by articles invoiced through agreements with research funders, institutions, or consortia, with only a few funding bodies driving hybrid OA uptake. As such, our findings point to the role of publishing agreements and OA policies in hybrid OA publishing.

After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. LIMITATIONS: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated.

METHODS One hundred consecutive rectal cancer patients who underwent rectal resection with primary anastomosis were enrolled in this study. RESULTS The overall rate of clinical anastomotic leakage in both groups was 7 % (7/100); 6 % (3/50) in the CSA group and 8 % (4/50) in the DSA group. The anastomotic technique did not have any significant influence on the rate of AL. All AL were seen in low anastomoses (7 cm and below). The rate of AL in patients with a diverting stoma (13 %, 3/23) was not significantly different from that of the patients without (5.2 %, 4/77) (p = 0.195). The mean length of the operation was significantly shorter in the DSA group compared to the CSA group, at 127 and 141 min, respectively (p = 0.005). There were significantly higher rates of AL in patients receiving preoperative long course radiotherapy (15.4 %, 6/39) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy (1.63 %, 1/61) (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS The CSA and DSA techniques are equally safe for the creation of a rectal anastomosis, without any significant difference in the AL rate.

This viral disease primarily causes lung pneumonia and has a wide range of clinical manifestations. The severity of infection ranges from those who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms which do not require hospital admission, to those who require ventilator support and eventually die, depending on immunity, age and other comorbidities existing with the patients. The present report is an attempt to study the effect of physiological and environmental factors existing at high altitudes (HA) with spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of existing data revealed that HA natives do possess certain physiological advantages such as (1) improved hypoxic ventilatory response, (2) higher concentration of oxygen carrying molecules, haemoglobin, (3) increased production of Vitamin D, due to intense solar radiation, (4) lower rates of comorbidities such as lung infections, obesity etc. and (5) most importantly reduced production of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a carrier molecule for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the host cell; all of which can collectively account for improved tolerance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in HA natives. In addition, environmental factors at HA such as (6) dry and chilly winds, (7) low air density and (8) intense UV radiations may further inhibit viral growth and spread into the atmosphere. We thus conclude that, high altitude natives may posses physiological and environmental advantage over low landers in terms of reduced severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its limited spread.

The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded relationship outcomes that are consistent with the known virus classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conform to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, the RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA stage displayed a remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48 respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: The study of genomic word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses.

RASE is a novel graph representation learning model which effectively preserves both graph structure and node attributes through a unified loss function. To be robust, RASE uses a denoising attribute auto-encoder to deal with node attribute noise, and models uncertainty in the embedding space as Gaussians to cope with graph structure noise.

METHODS: Six hundred thirty college students from two general universities completed a questionnaire packet containing life orientation testCrevised (LOTCR), core self-evaluations, and satisfaction with life scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the dimension of LOTCR. Bootstrap was used in structural equation modeling to analyze mediation effect. RESULTS: Results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. CFA identified the bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. SEM indicated that core self-evaluations partially mediated the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. The final model also revealed significant paths from optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction through core-self evaluations. CONCLUSION: The findings extended prior studies and shed light on how dispositional optimism influences life satisfaction. This study provides valuable evidence on how to promote the life satisfaction of human beings in positive psychology. A further study can fully explore the relationship among them in multi-cultural follow-up studies.","output":"Core Self-Evaluations Mediate the Associations of Dispositional Optimism and Life Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogens that cause respiratory diseases in poultry are highly diversified, and co-infections with multiple pathogens are prevalent. The H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are common poultry pathogens that limit the development of the poultry industry. This study aimed to clarify the interaction between these two pathogens and their pathogenic mechanism using a mouse model. Co-infection with H9N2 AIV and E. coli significantly increased the mortality rate of mice compared to single viral or bacterial infections. It also led to the development of more severe lung lesions compared to single viral or bacterial infections. Co-infection further causes a storm of cytokines, which aggravates the hosts disease by dysregulating the JAK/STAT/SOCS and ERK1/2 pathways. Moreover, co-infection mutually benefited the virus and the bacteria by increasing their pathogen loads. Importantly, nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression was also significantly enhanced by the co-infection. It played a key role in the rapid proliferation of E. coli in the presence of the co-infecting H9N2 virus. Therefore, our study underscores the role of NOS2 as a determinant for bacteria growth and illustrates its importance as an additional mechanism that enhances influenza virus-bacteria synergy. It further provides a scientific basis for investigating the synergistic infection mechanism between viruses and bacteria.","output":"Co-infection of H9N2 Influenza A Virus and Escherichia coli in a BALB/c Mouse Model Aggravates Lung Injury by Synergistic Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dialysis patients are both the most likely to benefit from vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 and at the highest risk of not developing an immune response. Data from the medical field are thus mandatory. We report our experience with a BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine in a retrospective analysis of 241 dialysis patients including 193 who underwent anti-Spike-Protein-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) IgG analysis. We show that a pro-active vaccine campaign is effective in convincing most patients to be vaccinated (95%) and frequently elicits a specific antibody response (94.3% after two doses and 98.4% after three doses). Only immunocompromised Status is associated with lack of seroconversion (OR 7.6 [1.5C38.2], p = 0.02). We also identify factors associated with low response (last quartile; IgG<500AU/mL): immunocompromised status, age, absence of RAAS inhibitors, low lymphocytes count, high C Reactive Protein; and with high response (high quartile; IgG>7000AU/mL): age; previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and active Cancer.

First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics. Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.","output":"Exploratory Analysis of Covid-19 Tweets using Topic Modeling, UMAP, and DiGraphs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite the known contribution of sport to health and well-being, sport participation declines in older age. However, for some people, sport continues to play an important role in older age and may contribute to improved health and well-being in older years. Although the health-related benefits of participating in sport are commonly reported, the reasons why some older adults continue to play sport are not well understood. This systematic review aimed to (1) identify studies from the literature that evaluated the reasons why older adults (aged 55 years and older) participate in sport and (2) synthesize and discuss the reasons for their participation reported in the literature. METHODS Searches of the electronic databases Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were performed. Studies were included that evaluated reasons for sport participation in adults aged 55 years and older because this is the age at which sport participation has been reported to begin declining. The studies included in this review used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods designs, were peer reviewed, and were published in the English language before the search date (20 January 2019). RESULTS A total of 1732 studies were identified. After exclusions, 30 studies were included in the review (16 qualitative, 10 quantitative, and 4 mixed methods). The review presents several features and findings from the studies, including a description and systematization of the reasons for participating in sport and the main reasons that participants gave for participating in sport (maintaining health, feeling and being part of a community, and taking advantage of opportunities to develop relationships). Other reasons included competing and attaining a feeling of achievement, taking advantage of opportunities for travel, and being part of a team. Sport was identified as contributing to the overall experience of successful ageing. There were few comparative differences for participating in sport, and there were only small differences between genders for the reasons given for participation. Generally, the quality of the studies was good; however, mixed methods studies lacked appropriate data analysis procedures. CONCLUSION Older adults play sport for a range of health-related and social reasons that can contribute to the experience of successful ageing. Strategies to increase sport participation by older adults should focus on promoting these aspects.","output":"Reasons why older adults play sport: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, donor hematopoietic stem cell grafts are frequently cryopreserved to ensure the availability of graft before starting a conditioning regimen. However, the safety of cryopreservation has been controversial in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially for bone marrow grafts. In addition, in unrelated HSCT, the effect of the time from harvest to cryopreservation of donor grafts required for the transportation of donor graft has not been fully clarified. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the first 112 patients with available data who underwent cryopreserved unrelated blood and marrow transplantation through the Japan Marrow Donor Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There were 112 patients, including 83 who received bone marrow (BM) graft and 29 who received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. The median time from stem cell harvest to cryopreservation was 9.9 hours (range 2.6-44.0 hours) and the median time from cryopreservation to infusion was 231.2 hours. The incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 28 after HSCT was 91.1%, and among 109 patients (excluding 3 patients with early death), all but one achieved neutrophil engraftment within 60 days after HSCT. The time-to-neutrophil and time-to-platelet engraftment were shorter in PBSCT than in BMT, but these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.064 and P=0.18). Multivariate analysis among BM recipients revealed that a higher number of frozen nucleated cells and the absence of HLA mismatch were associated with faster neutrophil engraftment. The time-to-neutrophil engraftment after unrelated cryopreserved BMT was not different from that after unrelated BMT without cryopreservation. CONCLUSION: Unrelated donor BM and PBSC grafts can be safely cryopreserved even after the transit time from the harvest center to the transplantation center. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, cryopreservation can be considered as an option, while balancing the risks and benefits of the procedure.","output":"Cryopreservation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells from a blood and marrow donor bank during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To identify specific factors that impact perceptions of research authenticity, we administered weekly reflection questions to CURE students. Coding of reflection responses revealed that experiences of failure, iteration, using scientific practices, and the relevant discoveries in their projects enhanced students perceived authenticity of their research experiences. Although failure and iteration can occur in both CUREs and inquiry-based curricula, our findings indicate these experiencesCin conjunction with the Relevant Discovery element of a CURECmay be particularly powerful in enhancing student perceptions of research authenticity in a CURE.","output":"Is This Science?

First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set.

The release of phenolic compounds from the food matrix during digestion is an important pre-requisite for their effectiveness within the human body, so it is fundamental to identify technological treatments able to preserve not only the concentration of phytochemicals but also their bioaccessibility. In this study we investigated the impact of high-pressure homogenization (HPH), alone and in the presence of 100 g kg-1 trehalose or Lactobacillus salivarius, on bioaccessibility of flavonoids in mandarin juice. In addition, digested mandarin juices were supplemented to liver cultured cells in basal and stressed condition to evaluate their protective effect in a biological system. RESULTS: HPH reduced the concentration of total phenolics and main flavonoids but increased their bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion (p < 0.001). In basal condition, supplementation with all digested juices significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration (p < 0.001). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in the medium was also reduced by supplementation with HPH-treated juices. Although pre-treatment with juices did not completely counteract the applied oxidative stress it preserved cell viability, and cells pre-treated with juices submitted to HPH in the presence of probiotics showed the lowest ROS concentration.

The primary aim of the present study was to psychometrically evaluate the Persian translation of the Self-Compassion Scale Youth version (SCS-Y) and evaluate its factor structure among young adolescents. The second aim was to explore the buffering effect of self-compassion against the negative effect of difficulties in emotion regulation on COVID-19-related anxiety. Methods A sample of young students (n = 532;mean age 13.57 years) completed an online survey, which included the SCS-Y, Patient Health Questionnaire, Difficulties In Emotion Regulation Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Youth Life Orientation Test, Brief Resilience Scale, and Brief 10-Item Big Five Inventory. First-order (six-factor) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and bi-factor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) analysis were used to evaluate the factor structure of the SCS-Y. Results Results showed that the SCS-Y had very good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha coefficient: 0.88;McDonalds omega coefficient: 0.90), composite reliability (0.87), and adequate testCretest reliability after 4 weeks (0.60). The first-order (six-factor) CFA and bi-factor ESEM analysis demonstrated the SCS-Y had excellent dimensionality. Further analysis found negative associations between self-compassion with both depression and neuroticism, and positive associations between self-compassion with both resilience and optimism. Moreover, self-compassion moderated the association between emotion dysregulation and anxiety generated by the COVID-19. Overall, the findings indicated that the SCS-Y had acceptable criterion-related validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Conclusions The findings provide evidence that the SCS-Y is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the six factors of self-compassion among younger adolescents. Based on the studys findings, self-compassion appears to be a protective factor against mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic for younger adolescents.","output":"Psychometric Validation of the Persian Self-Compassion Scale Youth Version"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously evolving. Although several vaccines were approved, this pandemic is still a major threat to public life. Till date, no established therapies are available against SARS-CoV-2. Peptide inhibitors hold great promise for this viral pathogen due to their efficacy, safety, and specificity. In this study, seventeen antiviral peptides which were known to inhibit SARS-CoV-1 are collected and computationally screened against heptad repeat 1 (HR1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S2). Out of 17 peptides, Fp13 and Fp14 showed better binding affinity toward HR1 compared to a control peptide EK1 (a modified pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor) in molecular docking. To explore the time-dependent interactions of the fusion peptide with HR1, molecular dynamics simulation was performed incorporating lipid membrane. During 100 ns MD simulation, structural and energy parameters of Fp13-HR1 and Fp14-HR1 complexes demonstrated lower fluctuations compared to the control EK1-HR1 complex. Furthermore, principal component analysis and free energy landscape study revealed that these two peptides (Fp13 and Fp14) strongly bind to the HR1 with higher affinity than that of control EK1. Tyr917, Asn919, Gln926, lys933, and Gln949 residues in HR1 protein were found to be crucial residues for peptide interaction. Notably, Fp13, Fp14 showed reasonably better binding free energy and hydrogen bond contribution than that of EK1. Taken together, Fp13 and Fp14 peptides may be highly specific for HR1 which can potentially prevent the formation of the fusion core and could be further developed as therapeutics for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Repurposing fusion inhibitor peptide against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionHealthcare professionals report about anxiety, depression, and fear during pandemic COVID-19 worldwide.

Positive correlations were found between depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 (p0,001), between age and fear of COVID-19 (p0,05). No statistically significant association between age and depression, anxiety, or resilience was found. The significant difference of COVID-19 fear depending on gender C female vs male (p0,05) was found. No statistically significant difference in resilience and emotional state in healthcare professionals depending on the involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19 were found.ConclusionsResilience is associated with better mental health in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The optimal impregnation ratio (hydrochar and FeCl(3)) was 1/1.25 (wt/wt). H-SB was applied to remove paracetamol (PRC) from water. Results indicated that H-SB exhibited a relatively low surface area (127 m(2)/g) and total pore volume (0.089 cm(3)/g). The presence of iron particles in its surface was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The dominant form of iron nanoparticles (-Fe(2)O(3)) in its surface was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectrum. The crystallite size of -Fe(2)O(3) in H-SB was 27.4 nm. The saturation magnetization of H-SB was 6.729 cmu/g. The analysis of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that the C-O and O-H groups were mainly responsible for loading -Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles in its surface. The adsorption study indicated the amount of PRC adsorbed by H-SB slightly decreased within solution pH from 2 to 11. The adsorption reached a fast saturation after 120 min. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of H-SB was 49.9 mg/g at 25 C and pH 7.0. Ion-dipole interaction and - interaction played an important role in adsorption mechanisms, while hydrogen bonding and pore filling were minor. Therefore, H-SB can serve as a promising material for treating PRC-contaminated water streams.

Starting in March, some patients who called 911 and required advanced life support (ALS) may have decompensated more rapidly than would have been expected, possibly because of concomitant COVID19 infection and/or delays in seeking medical care because of fear of exposure to the virus, and social isolation. In this study, our goal was to determine if there was an increase in prehospital ALS pronouncements and a decrease in ED visits for potentially serious conditions such as MI and stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ. METHODS STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of prehospital patients pronounced dead by paramedics and patients with MI and stroke in the EDs of receiving hospitals of these paramedics. Study Setting and Population: Ten ground ALS units in northern NJ and nine receiving hospital EDs. Each ALS unit is staffed by two NJ-certified mobile intensive care paramedics and respond with a paramedic flycar in a two-tiered dispatch system. DATA ANALYSIS: We identified prehospital pronouncements using the EMSCharts electronic record (Zoll Medical, Chelmsford, Massachusetts). We tabulated the number of pronouncements by week from January 1 to June 30 in 2019 and 2020. We tabulated the combined total number of pronouncements and ED visits by month along with visits for MI and stroke and calculated the changes during the same timeframe. We used Chi-square to test for statistical significance for the monthly changes from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: For January through June in 2019 and 2020, there were 12,210 and 13,200 ALS dispatches, and 366 and 555 prehospital pronouncements, respectively. In 2020, pronouncements rose from a weekly baseline of 13 in early March, reached a peak of 45 at the beginning of April, then returned to the baseline level by the end of May. April 2020, the month with the most pronouncements, had 183% more pronouncements than April 2019 but total ED visits and visits for MI and stroke were 49%, 46% and 42% less, respectively (p < 0.0001 for each of these changes). CONCLUSION: Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ, we found pre-hospital ALS death pronouncements increased and ED visits for MI and stroke decreased.

This led to delays in the initiation and completion of cancer treatment. We assessed the long-term health consequences because of the delay in diagnosis and treatment for cervical cancer due to COVID-19 in India. METHODS: We used a Markov-modelCbased analysis assessing the lifetime health outcomes of the cohort of women population at risk from cervical cancer in India. The decrease in survival for those with the treatment interruption was calculated based on the number of days the treatment was extended beyond the standard duration. Furthermore, to model the impact of late diagnosis and delayed treatment initiation, the patients were assumed to have upstaged during the delay period, as per natural progression of disease. RESULTS: We estimate 2.52% (n = 795) to 3.80% (n = 2,160) lifetime increase in the deaths caused by cervical cancer with treatment restrictions ranging from 9 weeks to 6 months, respectively, as compared to no delay. On the contrary, 88-238 deaths because of COVID-19 disease are estimated to be saved during this restriction period among the patients with cervical cancer. Overall, the excess mortality because of cervical cancer led to 18,159-53,626 life-years being lost and an increase of 16,808-50,035 disability-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSION: Delays in diagnosis and treatment are likely to lead to more cervical cancer deaths as compared to COVID-19 mortality averted among the patients with cervical cancer. Health systems must reorganize in terms of priority setting for provision of care, starting with prioritizing the treatment of patients with early-stage cervical cancer, increasing use of teleconsultation, and strengthening the role of primary care physicians in provision of cancer care.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Outcomes for Patients With Cervical Cancer in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because it will need to be fully actualized to properly acknowledge the contribution of several genomic data contributors, including the unique contribution of the COG-UK consortium.

Resilience is a process that incorporates many of the core skills and abilities which may enable people to address stigma and discrimination. The current study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination. METHODOLOGY: We used a quasi-experimental, before-after study design with a mixed methods approach. The 10-week family-based intervention was designed to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families by enhancing their protective abilities and capacity to overcome adversity. The study was conducted in two sites, urban areas in Telangana state, and in rural areas in Odisha state, India. Persons affected and their family members were included using purposive sampling. Two questionnaires were used pre-and post-intervention: the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC, maximum score 100, with high scores reflecting greater resilience) and the WHOQOL-BREF (maximum score of 130, with higher scores reflecting higher quality of life). In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted post-intervention. Data were collected at baseline, a few weeks after completion of the intervention, and in the Odisha cohort again at six months after completion. Paired t-tests measured differences pre- and post- intervention. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. FINDINGS: Eighty participants across 20 families were included in the study (23 persons affected and 57 family members). We found a significant increase in CD-RISC scores for persons affected and family members from Odisha state (baseline 46.5, first follow-up 77.0, second follow-up 70.0), this improvement was maintained at six-month follow-up. There was no increase in CD-RISC scores post-intervention among participants from Telangana state. WHOQOL-BREF scores were significantly higher at follow-up for persons affected in both states, and for family members in Odisha state. No families dropped out of the study. In the qualitative feedback, all participants described drawing benefit from the programme. Participants especially appreciated the social dimensions of the intervention. CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed that the 10-week family-based intervention to strengthen resilience among persons affected by leprosy and their family members was feasible, and has the potential to improve resilience and quality of life. A large-scale efficacy trial is necessary to determine the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention.","output":"Strengthening individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination: A pilot intervention study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lightweight deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) present a good solution to achieve fast and accurate image-guided diagnostic procedures of COVID-19 patients.

Objective: This study was designed to survey the status-quo of how German medical faculties view the digitization progress and to what extend digital capability building is already integrated into the curricula. Methods: A questionnaire with three focus areas was developed: Firstly, the general view of the medical faculties on digitization; secondly, concrete measures to prepare students for digital change and thirdly, the overarching organizational and regulatory conditions. The data was collected through short, questionnaire-based telephone interviews among those responsible for the curriculum at their faculty. The datasets collected were anonymized and statistically evaluated. Results: 30 interviews were conducted. The majority of faculty representatives agreed that digitization will change the role of physicians (87% agreement). Changes caused by individual digitization trends were however viewed to be less likely, e.g., whether medical expertise will become less important due to digital assistance systems (20% agreement), whether physician positions will be replaced by robots and algorithms (7% agreement), or whether hierarchies in hospitals will flatten (13% agreement). Digitization was seen to be of major importance for medical studies (93% agreement). Associated content should be given a higher priority in the curriculum (87% agreement). Two-thirds of faculty representatives believed that overarching institutions such as politics and medical associations ought to have more concrete plans for implementing the digital transformation and that innovations should be implemented in practice faster. Conclusion: While most faculty representatives attach great importance to the digitization of the health care system for university education, various questions about structural teaching measures to prepare students for the digital change show that there is no uniform education of medical students for a digitized health care system.

Methods: included a review of gray literature and research literature, followed by key informant interviews with nine organizational representatives in employment research and policy, workforce development, and industry to assess perceived needs and gaps in practice. Results: Evidence highlights the complex nature of underemployment and unemployment, with multiple macro-level underlying drivers, including the changing nature of work, a dynamic labor market, inadequate enforcement of labor protection standards, declining unions, wage depression, and weak political will interacting with multiple social determinants of health. Empirical literature on unemployment and physical, mental, and psychological well-being, substance abuse, depression in young adults, and suicides is quite extensive; however, there are limited data on the impacts of underemployment on worker health and well-being. Additionally, organizations do not routinely consider health outcomes as they relate to their work in workforce or policy development. Discussion and Conclusions: Several gaps in data and research will need to be addressed in order to assess the full magnitude of the public health burden of underemployment and unemployment. Public health needs to champion a research and practice agenda in partnership with multisector stakeholders to illuminate the role of employment quality and status in closing the gap on health inequities, and to integrate workforce health and well-being into labor and economic development agendas across government agencies and industry.","output":"Public Health Impacts of Underemployment and Unemployment in the United States: Exploring Perceptions, Gaps and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a 43-year-old patient with coronavirus disease 2019 who developed a bullous hemorrhagic rash that progressed to necrotic lesions Histopathology confirmed a vasculitis of small- and medium-sized cutaneous vessels","output":"Cutaneous Vasculitis in a Patient With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fungal infections are responsible for >1.5 million deaths globally per year, primarily in those with compromised immune function.

METHODS: We analyzed hospital discharge data from the most recent (2018) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample, and outpatient visit data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Costs are presented in 2018 United States (US) dollars. RESULTS: In the 35.5 million inpatient visits documented in 2018 in the US, approximately 666 235 fungal infections were diagnosed, with an estimated attributable cost of $6.7 billion.

MethodsWe performed a nested analysis of a seroprevalence study among all volunteering LTCF staff to determine community and nosocomial risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity using modified Poison regression. We also combined epidemiological and genetic sequencing data from a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak investigation in a LTCF ward to infer transmission dynamics and acquisition routes of SARS-CoV-2, and evaluated strain relatedness using a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. ResultsAmong 285 LTCF employees, 176 participated in the seroprevalence study, of whom 30 (17%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Most (141/176, 80%) were healthcare workers (HCWs). Risk factors for seropositivity included exposure to a COVID-19 inpatient (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.6; 95%CI 0.9-8.1) and community contact with a COVID-19 case (aPR 1.7; 95%CI 0.8-3.5).

To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2.

The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved.

In patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, CSF drainage via lumbar puncture decreases intracranial pressure, which relieves the stenosis, and may provide at least temporary cessation of pulsatile tinnitus. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in venous blood flow caused by lowered intracranial pressure in patients with pulsatile tinnitus to help identify the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients with suspected transverse sinus stenosis as a venous etiology for pulsatile tinnitus symptoms underwent MR imaging before and after lumbar puncture in the same session. The protocol included flow assessment and rating of pulsatile tinnitus intensity before and after lumbar puncture and MR venography before lumbar puncture. Post-lumbar puncture MR venography was performed in 1 subject. RESULTS There was a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity that correlated with the opening pressure (r = -0.72, P = .019) without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. Patients with flow jets had their peak velocity reduced by 0.30  0.18 m/s (P = .002), correlating with a reduction in CSF pressure (r = 0.82, P = .024) and the reduction in subjectively scored pulsatile tinnitus intensity (r = 0.78, P = .023). The post-lumbar puncture MR venography demonstrated alleviation of the stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our results show a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. We hypothesize that the reduction is caused by the expansion of the stenosis after lumbar puncture. Our results further show a correlation between the peak velocity and pulsatile tinnitus intensity, suggesting the flow jet to be instrumental in the development of sound.","output":"Reduced Jet Velocity in Venous Flow after CSF Drainage: Assessing Hemodynamic Causes of Pulsatile Tinnitus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many nations responded to the corona virus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic by restricting travel and other activities during 2020, resulting in temporarily reduced emissions of CO(2), other greenhouse gases and ozone and aerosol precursors.

They selectively interfere with the growth of other bacteria. The production and secretion of bacteriocins confer a distinct ecological advantage to the producer in competing against other bacteria that are present in the same ecological niche. Streptococcus mutans, a significant contributor to the development of dental caries, is one of the most prolific producer of bacteriocins, known as mutacins in S. mutans In this study, we characterized the locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266, a lantibiotic with a broad-spectrum of activity. The chromosomal locus is composed of six predicted operon structures encoding proteins involved in regulation, antimicrobial activity, biosynthesis, modification, transport, and immunity. Mutacin B-Ny266 was purified from semi-solid cultures and two inhibitory peptides, LanA and LanA', were detected. Both peptides were highly modified. Such modifications include dehydration of serine and threonine, and the formation of a C-terminal aminovinyl-cysteine (AviCys) ring. While LanA peptide alone is absolutely required for antimicrobial activity, the presence of LanA' enhanced the activity of LanA, suggesting that B-Ny266 may function as a two-peptide lantibiotic. The activation of lanAA' expression is most likely controlled by the conserved two-component system NsrRS that is activated by LanA peptide but not LanA'. The chromosomal locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266 was not universally conserved in all sequenced S. mutans genomes. Intriguingly, the genes encoding LanAA' peptides were restricted to the most invasive serotypes of S. mutans IMPORTANCE Although dental caries is largely preventable, it remains the most common and costly infectious diseases worldwide. Caries is initiated by the presence of dental plaque biofilm that contains Streptococcus mutans, a species extensively characterized for its role in caries development and formation. S. mutans deploys an arsenal of strategies to establish itself within the oral cavity. One of them is the production of bacteriocins that confer a competitive advantage by targeting and killing closely related competitors. In this work, we found that mutacin B-Ny266 is a potent lantibiotic effective at killing a wide-array of oral streptococci, including nearly all S. mutans strains tested.

METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9-53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10-37 days).

Atherosclerosis causes low-grade inflammation from the endothelial side; whereas giant cell arteritis (GCA) causes intense inflammation from the adventitial side. GCA is the most common autoimmune vasculitis in the elderly characterized by the formation of granulomas composed of T cells and macrophages in medium- and large-sized vessels. Recent studies explored the pathophysiology of GCA at unprecedented resolutions, and shed new light on cellular signaling pathways and metabolic fitness in wall-destructive T cells and macrophages. Moreover, recent reports have revealed that not only can cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke and ischemic optic neuropathy, be initial or coexistent manifestations of GCA, but the same is true for dementia and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we first outline how aging affects vascular homeostasis. Subsequently, we review the updated pathophysiology of GCA and explain the similarities and differences between vascular aging and GCA. Then, we introduce the possible link between T cell aging, neurological aging, and GCA. Finally, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting both senescence and vascular inflammation.","output":"Aging-Related Vascular Inflammation: Giant Cell Arteritis and Neurological Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family physicians or pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) work in non-hospital settings. GPs usually visit many patients, frequently at their homes, with low potential, if any, to control the work setting.

The present study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 133 GPs working in Catania (Italy) after the first wave of COVID-19. Serological analysis revealed a low seroprevalence (3%) among GPs. The low seroprevalence highlighted in the results can be attributed to correct management of patients by GPs in the first wave.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between IFN-I levels in patients with COVID-19 and clinical presentation, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and other major pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: This prospective observational study recruited patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-), interferon-beta (IFN-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10) within 5 days after symptom onset were measured using an ELISA, in serum from blood collected within 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was determined via qPCR using nasal-swab specimens and serum. RESULTS: The study enrolled 50 patients with COVID-19. IFN- levels were significantly higher in patients who presented with pneumonia or developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (p < 0.001). Furthermore, IFN- levels were associated with viral load in nasal-swab specimens and RNAemia (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant association between IFN- levels and the presence of pneumonia or RNAemia, despite showing a stronger association with nasal-swab viral load (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that the serum levels of IFN- significantly correlated with those of IFN-, IL-6, and CXCL10, while the levels of IFN- did not correlate with those of IL-6 or CXCL10. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IFN-I levels in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher in patients who developed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The association between IFN-, IL-6, and CXCL10 may reflect the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 invasion into pulmonary circulation, which might be an early predictor of respiratory failure due to COVID-19.","output":"Circulating Type I Interferon Levels in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Are Associated With the Development of Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to the adoption of severe measures to counteract the spread of the infection.

RESULTS: When analyzing the molecular docking data it was noticed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin possess lower binding energy with S protein as compared to the references. In the case of TMPRSS2 protein and PL(PRO) protease the best docked ligand was levofloxacin and in the case of E proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase the best docked ligands were levofloxacin and dexamethasone. Moreover, a molecular dynamics study also reveals that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin form a stable complex with E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PL(PRO)).

We describe our year-long institutional experience with telemedicine in several general surgery clinics at an academic tertiary care center and examine the relationship between area-based socioeconomic measures and the likelihood of telemedicine participation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of our outpatient telemedicine utilization among four subspecialty clinics (including two acute care and two elective surgery clinics). Geocoding was used to link patient visit data to area-based socioeconomic measures and a multivariable analysis was performed to examine the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and patient participation in telemedicine. RESULTS: While total outpatient visits per month reached a nadir in April 2020 (65% decrease in patient visits when compared to January 2020), there was a sharp increase in telemedicine utilization during the same month (38% of all visits compared to 0.8% of all visits in the month prior). Higher rates of telemedicine utilization were observed in the two elective surgery clinics (61% and 54%) compared to the two acute care surgery clinics (14% and 9%). A multivariable analysis demonstrated a borderline-significant linear trend (p = 0.07) between decreasing socioeconomic status and decreasing odds of telemedicine participation among elective surgery visits. A sensitivity analysis to examine the reliability of this trend showed similar results. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has many patient-centered benefits, and this study demonstrates that for certain elective subspecialty clinics, telemedicine may be utilized as the preferred method for surgical consultations.

Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India. Methodology: In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India. Results: Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly.

Therapeutic interventions currently used to treat these deficits are only partially efficacious, which is a consequence of limited understanding of the mechanism of action of ethanol. Here, we describe a novel effect of ethanol in the developing brain. Specifically, we show that exposure of rats to ethanol in vapor chambers during the equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy causes brain micro-hemorrhages. This effect was observed both at low and high doses of ethanol vapor exposure, and was not specific to this exposure paradigm as it was also observed when ethanol was administered via intra-esophageal gavage. The vast majority of the micro-hemorrhages were located in the cerebral cortex but were also observed in the hypothalamus, midbrain, olfactory tubercle, and striatum. The auditory, cingulate, insular, motor, orbital, retrosplenial, somatosensory, and visual cortices were primarily affected. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the micro-hemorrhages caused neuronal loss, as well as reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Analysis with the Catwalk test revealed subtle deficits in motor function during adolescence/young adulthood. In conclusion, our study provides additional evidence linking developmental ethanol exposure with alterations in the fetal cerebral vasculature.

Neonatal immunization with BCG, the live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is associated with broad protection against a range of unrelated pathogens, possibly reflecting vaccine-induced training of innate immune cells (innate memory). However, little is known regarding the impact of age on BCG-induced innate responses. OBJECTIVE: Establish an age-specific human monocyte in vitro training platform to characterize and compare BCG-induced primary and memory cytokine responses and immunometabolic shifts. DESIGN/METHODS: Human neonatal and adult CD33-selected monocytes were stimulated for 24h with RPMI (control) or BCG (Danish strain) in 10% autologous serum, washed and cultured for 5 additional days, prior to re-stimulation with the TLR4 agonist LPS for another 24h. Supernatants were collected at Day 1 (D1) to measure primary innate responses and at Day 7 (D7) to assess memory innate responses by ELISA and multiplex cytokine and chemokine assays. Lactate, a signature metabolite increased during trained immunity, was measured by colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Cytokine production by human monocytes differed significantly by age at D1 (primary, BCG 1:750 and 1:100 vol/vol, p<0.0001) and D7 (innate memory response, BCG 1:100 vol/vol, p<0.05). Compared to RPMI control, newborn monocytes demonstrated greater TNF (1:100, 1:10 vol/vol, p<0.01) and IL-12p40 (1:100 vol/vol, p<0.05) production than adult monocytes (1:100, p<0.05). At D7, while BCG-trained adult monocytes, as previously reported, demonstrated enhanced LPS-induced TNF production, BCG-trained newborn monocytes demonstrated tolerization, as evidenced by significantly diminished subsequent LPS-induced TNF (RPMI vs. BCG 1:10, p <0.01), IL-10 and CCL5 production (p<0.05). With the exception of IL-1RA production by newborn monocytes, BCG-induced monocyte production of D1 cytokines/chemokines was inversely correlated with D7 LPS-induced TNF in both age groups (p<0.0001). Compared to BCG-trained adult monocytes, newborn monocytes demonstrated markedly impaired BCG-induced production of lactate, a metabolite implicated in immune training in adults. CONCLUSIONS: BCG-induced human monocyte primary- and memory-innate cytokine responses were age-dependent and accompanied by distinct immunometabolic shifts that impact both glycolysis and training. Our results suggest that immune ontogeny may shape innate responses to live attenuated vaccines, suggesting age-specific approaches to leverage innate training for broad protection against infection.","output":"Human Newborn Monocytes Demonstrate Distinct BCG-Induced Primary and Trained Innate Cytokine Production and Metabolic Activation In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Term newborns with pneumonia show a reduced pulmonary compliance due to multiple and ill-defined factors.

METHODS: In 28 term ventilated newborns, 13 with pneumonia and 15 with no lung disease, we measured SP-B, SP-A, disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), and total phospholipids (PL) concentrations in tracheal aspirates at intubation and close to extubation. We also measured DSPC kinetics using (U-(13)C-PA)dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine. RESULTS: At baseline, SP-B, expressed as % of PL, was significantly different between the groups, being 3.5-fold higher in pneumonia than controls. Conversely, SP-A did not vary between the groups. At extubation, SP-B and SP-A concentrations had decreased significantly in newborns with pneumonia, while there was no significant change in controls.

The objectives of this study were to characterize how first-year medical students integrated knowledge to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic and to characterize students diagnostic reasoning approach to this clinical scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Student teams analyzed clinical data to formulate hypotheses for the pandemics source and submitted reports justifying their hypotheses and treatment recommendations. A content analysis on students reports identified codes and themes characterizing the learning content integrated and students approaches to diagnostic reasoning tasks. RESULTS: Sixteen problem-solving codes were identified, demonstrating integration of new and previously encountered content from multiple disciplines. A compare-contrast analytical approach was the most commonly employed diagnostic reasoning approach (100%), with a smaller subset of teams also using a causal approach (20%). DISCUSSION: Content analysis of preclinical students diagnostic justification tasks provided insights into their approach to diagnostic reasoning, which was most consistent with the search-inference framework rather than a causal approach, likely due to limited pathophysiological knowledge at that point in training.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with intense cytokine release (also known as a \\"cytokine storm\\"). Similar to COVID-19, HLH is characterized by aggressive course leading to multi-organ failure. MAIN TEXT: The purpose of this review article is to draw attention to the possibility of the complication of HLH in patients with the severe course of COVID-19. Indeed, some of the clinical characteristics observed in the more severe cases of COVID-19 are reminiscent of secondary HLH (which can be triggered by infections, malignancies, rheumatological diseases, or autoimmune/immunodeficiency conditions). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection also suggests that HLH or a similar hyperinflammatory syndrome is the cause of the severe course of the infection. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 indicate that an increased inflammatory response corresponding to HLH is occurring. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using standard laboratory tests to identify those for whom immunosuppressive therapy may improve outcomes.","output":"Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) is potentially curable or a controllable disease if strict adherence to surveillance protocol is followed.

There is scanty data in the literature evaluating the impact of non-compliance to surveillance protocol on progression, recurrence, and mortality rate. We do believe that this data will add to the literature especially during the COVID-19 pandemic which affects and delays daily elective surgeries. Methods: A retrospective study of two hundred bladder biopsy and resection between 2012-2017. Eighty-eight patients with minimal 3 years follow up data were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their compliance with the cystoscopy follow up as recommended by the European guidelines. We compared the cystoscopy compliant group to the non-compliant group in view of recurrence, progression, and mortality. In addition, missing variable items during surveillance are calculated in a new scoring model to predict the adverse outcome. Results: Recurrence rate (RR), progression rate (PR), metastasis rate (MsR) and mortality rate (MR) are significantly higher in non-compliant group, RR: (92.6%) ( P< 0.001), PR: (54.1%) ( P< 0.001), MsR: (37.7%) ( P< 0.001), MR: (23.5%) ( P = 0.002) respectively.

The goal of these S3 guidelines is to evaluate the recommendations in regard to evidence based medicine and to define therapy goals for monitoring and therapy. In context with the clinical situation the evaluation of the different hemodynamic parameters allows the development of a therapeutic concept and the definition of goal criteria to evaluate the effect of treatment. Up to now there are only guidelines for subareas of postoperative treatment of cardiothoracic surgical patients, like the use of a pulmonary artery catheter or the transesophageal echocardiography. The German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Thorax-, Herz- und Gef?sschirurgie, DGTHG) and the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft fr An?sthesiologie und lntensivmedizin, DGAI) made an approach to ensure and improve the quality of the postoperative intensive care medicine after cardiothoracic surgery by the development of S3 consensus-based treatment guidelines. Goal of this guideline is to assess the available monitoring methods with regard to indication, procedures, predication, limits, contraindications and risks for use. The differentiated therapy of volume-replacement, positive inotropic support and vasoactive drugs, the therapy with vasodilatators, inodilatators and calcium sensitizers and the use of intra-aortic balloon pumps will also be addressed.

This study aimed to describe the psychiatric morbidity of patients with COVID-19 referred to liaison psychiatry services in Qatar. METHOD: This study was a retrospective review of patient records of the first 100 consecutive SARS-Cov-2 positive patients referred to liaison psychiatry services. The study was approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Board (IRB) (MRC-05C072). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULT: The majority (n = 92) of 100 included patients were male and median age was 43 years. Patients were of diverse background with majority of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Nepalese, and Afghan) (n = 60), followed by Qatari (n = 18) background. Mean length of hospital stay was 26.51 days. 35 patients had severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and 67 had at least one underlying physical comorbidity. Significant psychosocial stressors other than positive SARS-Cov-2 status, including lockdown, quarantine, finances and relationships issues were identified in 48 patients. A total of 35 patients had a positive past psychiatric history, out of which 17 were on maintenance psychotropic medications. Insomnia was the commonest psychiatric symptom (n = 65), followed by anxiety (n = 52), agitation (n = 42), depression (n = 39), changes in appetite (n = 32) and irritability (n = 30). The principal psychiatric diagnoses made were delirium (n = 29), acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder (n = 25), depression (n = 16), mania (n = 15), anxiety (n = 14), non-affective psychosis (n = 13), and dementia (n = 6). Approximately half of the patients with mania or non-affective psychosis had it as their first-onset disorder. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, is associated with a wide range of psychiatric morbidity which emphasizes clinicians vigilance for psychiatric symptoms. Insomnia was the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom which may have clinical practice and potential preventive strategies implications. Delirium, the commonest diagnosis in the study carries high morbidity and mortality and may reflect SARS-Cov-2 propensity to affect the brain directly and indirectly through a cytokine storm, organ failure, and prothrombotic state. Patients can also present with new-onset mania or non-affective psychosis. It is noteworthy that about two-thirds of the patients had no past psychiatric history. This study, along with expanding body of evidence may assist with resource allocation and liaison psychiatry services planning. It also underscores the importance of designing future studies to better understand longer-term psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19.","output":"Psychiatric presentations of patients with COVID-19: a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients seen by liaison psychiatry services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".","output":"Ultrasound as an alternative bedside tool to quickly confirm the position of the enteral catheter in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2021 Birks Award was presented to Lee Grodzins, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA.

The psychological response affects the individual as well as the community and can persist long after the outbreak. We aim to assess coping strategies employed by women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey which included a query about coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. Results: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20C85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). Conclusions: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well. As coping mechanisms profoundly impact quality of life, oncology providers must assist patients in identifying coping strategies that optimize physical and psychological well-being.","output":"Adapting and avoiding coping strategies for women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"See the Reply by De Matteis et al.","output":"Comment on: Predicting In\\\\Hospital Mortality in COVID\\\\19 Older Patients with Specifically Developed Scores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed the levels of mental workload and the presence of burnout on a sample of fashion retailing workers from Spain and its relationship with the actual Covid-19 pandemic by exploring Covid-19 pandemic predictors of burnout and mental workload.

Large scale studies of temporal trend of blood pressure in adult dengue are lacking. In this study, we examined the differences in time trend of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients with and without severe dengue (SD), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and pre-existing hypertension, and elderly versus non-elderly patients. METHODS: We studied a retrospective cohort from 2005 to 2008 of 6,070 hospitalized adult dengue patients confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or clinical criteria plus positive dengue serology. Dengue severity was defined according to World Health Organization 1997 and 2009 guidelines. We used Bayesian hierarchical Markov models to compare the daily mean SBP and DBP between different subgroups. Analysis was conducted by day of defervescence (denoted as day 0), and day of illness onset (denoted as day 1) respectively. RESULTS: SBP decreased to a nadir during the critical phase before defervescence and was significantly lower for patients with SD or DHF, compared with patients without SD or DHF. DBP increased marginally more for patients with SD or DHF in the critical phase before defervescence. By day of defervescence, comparison of patients with and without SD showed significant difference in SBP from day -6 to day +6, except days +1, +3 and +5, and similarly in DBP except days 0, and +4 to +6. Comparison of patients with and without DHF showed significant difference in SBP from day -6 to day -1, but for DBP, significant difference was noted from day -6 to day +6, except day -2 to day 0. By day of illness, SBP differed significantly between patients with and without SD from illness days 1 to 10, and DBP from illness days 7 to 12. Between patients with and without DHF, SBP differed significantly on illness days 1, 2, 4 to 7, while DBP from days 7 to 12. On analysis by days of defervescence or by days of illness, elderly patients and those with hypertension showed consistently higher SBP and DBP throughout their hospitalization, as compared with their younger and non-hypertensive counterparts. CONCLUSION: In SD or DHF, SBP decreased to a nadir around the day of defervescence, and recovered to a level exceeding that in febrile phase by days 2 or 3 post-defervescence. Elderly patients and patients with pre-existing hypertension maintained higher SBP and DBP throughout the duration of dengue infection.","output":"Blood pressure trend in hospitalized adult dengue patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients with cancer is an ethical issue of worldwide interest.

In this paper, we explore a case study of one such method that has become popular in the analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. The integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), as implemented in the R-INLA package, approximates the marginal posterior distributions of target parameters that would have been obtained from a fully Bayesian analysis. We seek to answer an important question: Does existing research on the accuracy of INLA's approximations support how researchers are currently using it to analyze COVID-19 data? We identify three limitations to work assessing INLA's accuracy: 1) inconsistent definitions of accuracy, 2) a lack of studies validating how researchers are actually using INLA, and 3) a lack of research into the reproducibility of INLA's output. We explore the practical impact of each limitation with simulation studies based on models and data used in COVID-19 research. Our results suggest existing methods of assessing the accuracy of the INLA technique may not support how COVID-19 researchers are using it.

Purpose: To summarize evidence about the effect of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases from 1 January to 21 August 2020. Study Selection: Observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Data Extraction: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. Data synthesis: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 were controlled and 30 were not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group vs. the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). The overall NNT to avoid one death was 20. In hospital wards, patients in the TCZ-group were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion than those in the control group; however, ICU mortality of the TCZ-group was lower than in the control group. Secondary infections occurred in a higher proportion in TCZ-treated patients. Among survivors, the length of stay was similar in both groups. Limitations: Conclusions should be considered as weak evidence since they are based on observational studies, most of them retrospective. A variety of factors influencing the indication and effect of TCZ could not be evaluated in-depth. Conclusions: TCZ to seem beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Infected workers were described. The associations between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the socio-demographic and occupational characteristics were assessed in order to implement risk management measures targeting workers at increased risk of contamination. Workers were tested by RT-PCR from samples taken during screening campaigns. Workers who tested positive were isolated and their contacts were quarantined. Workers were described and associations with the SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed through risk ratios using multivariable Poisson regression. Of the 1347 workers, 87.5% were tested: 140 cases were identified; 4 were hospitalised, including 2 admitted to intensive care. In the company, the cluster remained limited to deboning and cutting activities. The attack rate was 11.9% in the company, reaching 16.6% in the cutting department. Being an employee of a subcontractor significantly increased the risk of infection by 2.98 [1.81C4.99]. In the cutting department, an association with virus infection was found for a group of non-French speaking workers from the same Eastern European country (RR = 2.67 [1.76C4.05]).

Data are needed on psychological predictors and other manifestations of IHD such as coronary microvascular disease, which is more common in women.","output":"Sex- and Gender-Stratified Risks of Psychological Factors for Incident Ischemic Heart Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a heritable cancer-predisposition syndrome with multiorgan involvement. Pancreatic lesions are detected in approximately two-thirds of patients with VHL disease at some point during their lifetime. In these patients, cystic pancreatic lesions are almost exclusively benign and, unless symptomatic, do not require surgical or endoscopic intervention; however, solid pancreatic lesions can often be recognized through imaging screens, and are commonly found to be nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) with malignant potential. The natural history of these VHL-associated pNETs is variable, and lacks clinical or imaging features that predict disease progression or metastatic potential, and generally needs to be managed more conservatively than their sporadic counterparts. Treatment options for such lesions, which range from active surveillance to surgical intervention, can nevertheless be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality. Of note, although several guidelines have been established for the management of tumours associated with VHL syndrome, none of these have specifically focused on pancreatic lesions. Thus, we aim to characterize the types of pancreatic lesions associated with VHL disease and their natural history, to identify particular lesions that necessitate treatment, and to define what forms of treatment should be undertaken.","output":"Evaluation and management of pancreatic lesions in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological techniques commonly used to quantify influenza-specific antibodies include the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) and Virus Neutralization (VN) assays.

In addition to SRH and HI assays, the technical advantages provided by other techniques such as the VN assay, pseudotype-based neutralization assay, neuraminidase and cell-mediated immunity assays need to be considered and regulated via EMA criteria, considering the many significant advantages that they could offer for the development of effective vaccines.","output":"Overview of Serological Techniques for Influenza Vaccine Evaluation: Past, Present and Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT: Revealed the spatial-temporal patterns of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidences in Mainland China. METHODS: Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) technique was applied to analyze the major spatial distribution modes and the temporal changes of AIDS incidences in Mainland China during 2002-2017. RESULTS: The annual average AIDS incidences increased from 0.06 per 100 000 in 2002 to 4.15 per 100 000 in 2017, with an annual average increase of 0.31 per 100 000. The southwest regions were high-incidence areas, as well as Xinjiang province in the northwest. There were two typical spatial modes. EOF 1 represented an isodirectional spatial pattern that the incidences were relatively high in general, and the fluctuation ranges were relatively high in the southwest and northeast. EOF 2 represented a reverse spatial pattern that the incidences were relatively high (or low) in Guangxi, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Shanghai, and Henan, yet were relatively low (or high) in the remaining regions. CONCLUSION: The AIDS incidences in Mainland China were relatively low during 2002-2010, yet were kept in a relatively high level since 2012.

The histological alterations in the intestinal tissue samples showed similarity with the well-known alterations described in typical targetorgans of the virus (e.g., the lung). This observation suggests a similar mechanism of action of the virus. Further larger studies are, thus, required to confirm this preliminary finding.

This cross-sectional study was conducted to identify factors affecting breastfeeding among mothers living in Thailand during the lockdown. Data were collected from 903 mothers with infants ages 0C12 months from 17 July 2020 to 17 October 2020 after the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown period by an online platform and interview questionnaire survey. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between the effect of lockdown and breastfeeding practices with potential confounder adjustment including maternal age, ethnicity, newborn age <6 months, family income below $16,130 per annum, education below undergraduate level, and working status. Mothers changed breastfeeding practices in this period (n = 39, 4.32%) including having changed from exclusive breastfeeding to combined breastfeeding with formula milk (n = 22, 2.44%), and having reduced the frequency when compared to before the pandemic (n = 13, 1.44%). The associated factors of changing breastfeeding practices were contact with healthcare services (aOR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96, p = 0.04), infant feeding support from health personnel (aOR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.94, p = 0.035), and lack family support and help with feeding your baby after lockdown (aOR = 7.04, 95% CI 1.92 to 25.84, p = 0.003). In conclusion, this study showed a slight decrease in breastfeeding in the sampled mothers during the COVID-19 lockdown in Thailand.

Both genetic factors and environmental factors play an important role in PD pathogenesis and response to treatment. However, PD is clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex, and the exact genetic or environmental causes of this disorder remain unclear. Various approaches for detecting disease-causing genes have recently been made available. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have attracted attention for the identification of disease-associated loci of multifactorial disorders. This review introduces GWAS of PD, followed by a discussion about the limitations of GWAS and the major challenges facing geneticists in the post-GWAS era. Alternative strategies to address these challenges are then proposed, such as epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) using next-generation sequencing. To date, however, few reports have described these analyses, and the evidence remains insufficient to confidently identify or exclude rare variants or epigenetic changes in PD. Further analyses are therefore required, using sample sizes in the tens of thousands, extensive functional annotations, and highly targeted hypothesis testing.","output":"Genetic and epigenetic analyses of panic disorder in the post-GWAS era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The surgical plethysmographic index (SPI) is one of the available indexes of the nociception-antinociception (NAN) balance. Individually adjusting the NAN balance to prevent somatic responses to noxious stimulation remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES To assess whether guiding remifentanil administration according to the SPI response to a calibrated noxious stimulus (NANCAL) can blunt the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. DESIGN Randomised multicentre study. SETTING Two Belgian university hospitals from January 2014 to April 2015. PATIENTS After ethic review board approval and informed consent, 48 American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II adult patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to a SPI group, where remifentanil effect-site concentration was adjusted according to NANCAL, or a control group, where it was fixed at 4 ng ml. Propofol concentration was always adjusted to maintain the bispectral index close to 40. NANCAL consisted of a 100 Hz, 60 mA electrical tetanic stimulation during 30 s at the wrist before tracheal intubation and before surgical incision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the efficacy of the NANCAL-guided remifentanil administration to prevent the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. The secondary aim was to compare the ability of SPI, analgesia nociception index, pupil diameter and mean arterial pressure response to NANCAL to predict the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. RESULTS Our SPI response to NANCAL-based correcting scheme for remifentanil administration was not superior to a fixed remifentanil concentration at blunting the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation or surgical incision. Among all tested NAN balance indices, only mean arterial pressure had significant predictive ability with regard to the haemodynamic response to surgical incision. CONCLUSION Further research is needed to define the best NANCAL stimulus and the best remifentanil correcting scheme to help individualised tailoring of antinociception for each specific subpopulation of surgical patients.

However, biological characterization of vaccine response has yet to be performed. Methods: Eligible pts with advanced GU cancers (metastatic/unresectable prostate, bladder and renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) and had not yet received COVID-19 vaccination. Pts were consented to receive sequential blood draws prior to vaccination and at landmarks of 2, 6, and 12 mos following vaccination. Pts on systemic treatment had additional blood draws coinciding with their first 3 cycles of therapy following vaccination. Ab titers to SARS-CoV-2 were quantified via ELISA and reported as an immune status ratio (ISR). RNA was extracted from PBMC aliquots, converted into cDNA and TCR / sequences were selectively amplified. TCR abundance and homology clustering was performed using custom scripts. Results: As of May 14, 2021, 130 pts had consented to the study of whom 126 pts submitted baseline (BL) specimens. The current analysis focuses on 56 pts who submitted cycle 1 (C1) specimens. Among these, 29, 26, and 1 pts had RCC, prostate and bladder cancer, respectively;19 were on checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-based regimens while 37 were on non-CPI regimens. BNT162b2 (Pfizer) was the most commonly administered vaccine in the cohort (n=29), followed by mRNA-1273 (Moderna;n=26). COVID-19 Ab titers increased significantly from BL to C1 across the cohort from 0.19 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.12-0.18) to 4.37 (IQR 0.2-6.60;P<0.0001). However, 8/56 pts (14.3%) receiving CPI-based regimens and 8/56 pts (14.3%) receiving non-CPI-based regimens were noted to have negative Ab titers after a median of 18 and 35 days following initial vaccination, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the increase from BL to C1 in pts receiving CPI vs non-CPI-based regimens.

Infection despite full vaccination (vaccine breakthrough) has been reported, but characteristics of those with vaccine breakthrough resulting in hospitalization and relative rates of hospitalization in unvaccinated and vaccinated persons are not well described, including during late June and July 2021 when the highly transmissible Delta variant predominated. Methods: From January 1-June 30, 2021, cases defined as adults aged []18 years with laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were identified from >250 acute care hospitals in the population-based COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Through chart review for sampled cases, we examine characteristics associated with vaccination breakthrough. From January 24-July 24, 2021, state immunization information system data linked to both >37,000 cases representative cases and the defined surveillance catchment area population were used to compare weekly hospitalization rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Unweighted case counts and weighted percentages are presented. Results: From January 1 - June 30, 2021, fully vaccinated cases increased from 1 (0.01%) to 321 (16.1%) per month. Among 4,732 sampled cases, fully vaccinated persons admitted with COVID-19 were older compared with unvaccinated persons (median age 73 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) 65-80] v. 59 years [IQR 48-70]; p<0.001), more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions (201 (70.8%) v. 2,305 (56.1%), respectively; p<0.001) and be residents of long-term care facilities [37 (14.5%) v. 146 (5.5%), respectively; p<0.001].

Little is known regarding the changes in kinetics of neutrophils phenotypes in inflammatory conditions. During acute inflammation more heterogeneity was found, characterized by an increase in CD16(dim) banded neutrophils. These cells were probably released from the bone marrow (left shift). Acute inflammation induced by human experimental endotoxemia (LPS model) was additionally accompanied by an immediate increase in a CD62L(low) neutrophil population, which was not as explicit after injury/trauma induced acute inflammation. The situation in sub-acute inflammation was more complex. CD62L(low) neutrophils appeared in the peripheral blood several days (>3 days) after trauma with a peak after 10 days. A similar situation was found in the blood of COVID-19 patients returning from the ICU. Sorted CD16(low) and CD62L(low) subsets from trauma and COVID-19 patients displayed the same nuclear characteristics as found after experimental endotoxemia. In diseases associated with chronic inflammation (stable COPD and treatment naive HIV) no increases in CD16(low) or CD62L(low) neutrophils were found in the peripheral blood. All neutrophil subsets were present in the bone marrow during homeostasis. After LPS rechallenge, these subsets failed to appear in the circulation, but continued to be present in the bone marrow, suggesting the absence of recruitment signals. Because the subsets were reported to have different functionalities, these results on the kinetics of neutrophil subsets in a range of inflammatory conditions contribute to our understanding on the role of neutrophils in health and disease.","output":"Kinetics of Neutrophil Subsets in Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Scientific hypothesis generation is a critical step in scientific research that determines the direction and impact of any investigation. Despite its vital role, we have limited knowledge of the process itself, hindering our ability to address some critical questions. Objective: To what extent can secondary data analytic tools facilitate scientific hypothesis generation during clinical research? Are the processes similar in developing clinical diagnoses during clinical practice and developing scientific hypotheses for clinical research projects? We explore the process of scientific hypothesis generation in the context of clinical research. The study is designed to compare the role of VIADS, our web-based interactive secondary data analysis tool, and the experience levels of study participants during their scientific hypothesis generation processes. Methods: Inexperienced and experienced clinical researchers are recruited. In this 2 by 2 study design, all participants use the same data sets during scientific hypothesis-generation sessions, following pre-determined scripts. The inexperienced and experienced clinical researchers are randomly assigned into groups with and without using VIADS. The study sessions, screen activities, and audio recordings of participants are captured. Participants use the think-aloud protocol during the study sessions. After each study session, every participant is given a follow-up survey, with participants using VIADS completing an additional modified System Usability Scale (SUS) survey. A panel of clinical research experts will assess the scientific hypotheses generated based on pre-developed metrics. All data will be anonymized, transcribed, aggregated, and analyzed. Results: This study is currently underway. Recruitment is ongoing via a brief online survey 1. The preliminary results show that study participants can generate a few to over a dozen scientific hypotheses during a 2-hour study session, regardless of whether they use VIADS or other analytic tools. A metric to assess scientific hypotheses within a clinical research context more accurately, comprehensively, and consistently has also been developed. Conclusion: The scientific hypothesis-generation process is an advanced cognitive activity and a complex process. Clinical researchers can quickly generate initial scientific hypotheses based on data sets and prior experience based on our current results. However, refining these scientific hypotheses is much more time-consuming. To uncover the fundamental mechanisms of generating scientific hypotheses, we need breakthroughs that capture thinking processes more precisely.","output":"Scientific hypothesis generation process in clinical research: a secondary data analytic tool versus experience study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has major impacted the insurance industry in three dimensions: business operations, underwriting and claims and insurance investing.

We then look at the effects of the dislocations in fixed income, which make up the largest share of exposures in insurance companies' portfolios. We track the performance of investment grade credit during the year while paying special attention to the impact of downgrades on insurers' solvency capital. We finally study alternative investments with particular focus on private markets. These investments are a faster-growing part of insurance companies' exposures and pose specific challenges as they are complex, more difficult to access, have limited liquidity and are often harder to price, especially during times of high market volatility. Yet, compared to their equivalent public market exposures, private investments provide additional income, which allows insurers to charge lower rates on their products to policyholders.

The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a tool (CCU-OHQoL) to assess OHQoL amongst patients admitted to CCU, (ii) to collect data to analyse the validity, reliability and acceptability of the CCU-OHQoL tool and (iii) to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU. METHODS: The project included three phases: (1) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel, (2) testing of the tool in CCU (n = 18) followed by semi-structured interviews to assess acceptability, face and content validity and (3) final tool modification and testing of CCU-OHQoL questionnaire to assess validity and reliability. RESULTS: The CCU-OHQoL showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer. Cronbachs alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency. For construct validity, the CCU-OHQoL was strongly and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients 0.71, 0.62 and 0.77, p < 0.01) with global OHQoL items. In the validation study, 37.8% of the participants reported a deterioration in self-reported oral health after CCU admission.

Striking racial disparities in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates exist nationally and in Florida, with higher rates among African Americans compared to other racial groups. Biological reasons for these disparities remain unexplained, primarily because most pancreatic cancer research has relied on biospecimens and data from Non-Hispanic Whites. Multidisciplinary teams from fifteen hospitals throughout the state of Florida have partnered together and with patients newly-diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to build the first state-wide biobanking infrastructure we know of that is dedicated to reducing the disproportionate burden of pancreatic cancer affecting African Americans. We describe important information on ascertainment and recruitment strategies and standard operating procedures developed to collect, process, store, and transfer biospecimens, medical images, and data from a diverse cohort of participants. The infrastructure described in this manuscript is intended to serve as a strong foundation for further research into biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that may contribute to observed disparities and a starting point to develop interventions to tackle these factors. This multi-institutional infrastructure can serve as a prototype for the development of similar resources across the country and disease sites. ABSTRACT: Background: Well-annotated, high-quality biorepositories provide a valuable platform to support translational research. However, most biorepositories have poor representation of minority groups, limiting the ability to address health disparities. Methods: We describe the establishment of the Florida Pancreas Collaborative (FPC), the first state-wide prospective cohort study and biorepository designed to address the higher burden of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) in African Americans (AA) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and Hispanic/Latinx (H/L). We provide an overview of stakeholders; study eligibility and design; recruitment strategies; standard operating procedures to collect, process, store, and transfer biospecimens, medical images, and data; our cloud-based data management platform; and progress regarding recruitment and biobanking. Results: The FPC consists of multidisciplinary teams from fifteen Florida medical institutions. From March 2019 through August 2020, 350 patients were assessed for eligibility, 323 met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 305 (94%) enrolled, including 228 NHW, 30 AA, and 47 H/L, with 94%, 100%, and 94% participation rates, respectively. A high percentage of participants have donated blood (87%), pancreatic tumor tissue (41%), computed tomography scans (76%), and questionnaires (62%).

Hierarchical linear regression was carried out with anxiety and depressive symptoms as separate out- comes. Of the COVID-19-related factors, testing positive for COVID-19 infection, having COVID-19 symptoms, having other medical conditions, self-isolating due to COVID-19 symptoms, worry about infection, perception of the pandemic as a threat to income and isolation during the lockdown were significantly associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Of these, worry about infection, isolation during lockdown and disruption due to the pandemic retained independent associations with both outcomes. The variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms explained by COVID-19-related factors was larger in women (11.8%) compared to men (6.1% and 0.8% respectively). COVID-19-related stressors are associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, with these effects being larger in men compared to women. Enhancing social support can be an affordable strategy to mitigate this risk but this needs to be investigated using appropriate designs.

The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has posed a great threat to the global economic environment and people's safety. As an industry of new economic development, tourism itself has weak market stability, and the occurrence of public security emergencies will have a greater impact on tourism. In this context, this paper takes the impact of COVID-19 on urban tourism in Wuhan, China, as a case study to explore the impact of public emergencies on urban tourism development. Using the method of questionnaire survey, the national tourists as a sample of sampling survey, from the perspective of the city's tourism image, tourists and tourism enterprises, descriptive statistics of tourists' perception, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) after the epidemic, tourists have a positive impact on the city's tourism image;(2) After the epidemic, only 35% of tourists are willing to travel to Wuhan in the form of travel agency, and more tourists prefer independent travel, with 63% of tourists choosing independent travel. (3) After the epidemic, tourists have changed their choice of scenic spots, ways of visiting and accommodation environment, and will consider safety factors more. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Analysis of the influencing factors of sudden and major public events on the development of urban tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.

Moreover, the correlation between the level of bilirubin and serum expression of IL-1 or TGF- in BE patients was analyzed. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic value of the cytokines. RESULTS: IL-1 and TGF- levels were higher in the serum of BE patients than those in non-BE patients, and the expression of either IL-1 or TGF- showed a strong positive correlation with the serum expression of bilirubin in BE patients. Moreover, the results of ROC analysis showed that either IL-1 or TGF- could distinguish BE patients from healthy controls.

To examine the evolution of symptoms and the extent of under-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Design: Prospective cohort study of randomly selected schools and classes. Setting: Schools remained open for physical attendance in Switzerland from May 2020 to the end of 2020/2021 school year. Lower school level (age range 7-10 years) and middle school level (8-13 years) children in primary schools, and upper school level (12-17 years) children in secondary schools were invited for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing in the Ciao Corona study in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Three testing rounds were completed in June-July 2020 (T1; after the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections), October-November 2020 (T2; during the peak of the second wave), and March-April 2021 (T3; after the second wave and with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern becoming dominant). Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic information and symptoms. Participants: 2487 children (median age 12 years, age range 7-17 years) recruited from 275 classes in 55 schools participated in the testing in March-April 2021; total of 2974 children participated in at least one of the 3 testing rounds. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 serology results; clustering of seropositive children within classes; reported symptoms. Results: The proportion of children who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive increased from 1.5% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.6% to 2.6%) in June-July 2020, to 6.6% (95% CrI 4.0% to 8.9%) in October-November, and to 16.4% (95% CrI 12.1% to 19.5%) in March-April 2021. By March-April 2021, children in upper school level (12.4%; 95% CrI 7.3% to 16.7%) were less likely to be seropositive than those in middle (19.5%; 95% CrI 14.2% to 24.4%) or lower school levels (16.0%; 95% CrI 11.0% to 20.4%). Children in the upper school level had a 5.1% (95% CI -9.4% to -0.7%) lower than expected seroprevalence by March-April 2021 than those in middle school level, based on difference-in-differences analysis. The ratio of PCR-diagnosed to all seropositive children changed from 1 to 21.7 (by June-July 2020) to 1 to 3.5 (by March-April 2021). Symptoms were reported by 37% of newly seropositive and 16% seronegative children. Potential clusters of 3 or more newly seropositive children were detected in 24 of 119 (20%) classes with a high participation rate, from which a median of 17 clusters could be expected due to random distribution of seropositive children within the classes. Clustering was lowest in middle and upper school levels. Retention rate in the cohort was high (84% of T1 participants attended T3). Among participants, supporting society and research were reported more commonly for participation than personal reasons. Fear of blood sampling was the most frequently reported reason for non-participation, reported for 64% of children. Conclusions: By March-April 2021, 16.4% of children and adolescents were seropositive in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. The majority of clusters of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive children in school classes could be explained by community rather than intra-class transmission of infections.

We have recently developed a method to create small antibody mimetics called FLuctuation-regulated Affinity Proteins (FLAPs), which consist of a small protein scaffold with a structurally immobilized target-binding peptide. In this study, to further develop this method, we established a novel screening system for FLAPs called monoclonal antibody-guided peptide identification and engineering (MAGPIE), in which a mAb guides selection in two manners. First, antibody-guided design allows construction of a peptide library that is relatively small in size, but sufficient to identify high-affinity binders in a single selection round. Second, in antibody-guided screening, the fluorescently labeled mAb is used to select mammalian cells that display FLAP candidates with high affinity for the target using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We demonstrate the reliability and efficacy of MAGPIE using daclizumab, a mAb against human interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25). Three FLAPs identified by MAGPIE bound CD25 with dissociation constants of approximately 30 nM as measured by biolayer interferometry without undergoing affinity maturation.

Our objective was to describe characteristics of telestroke consultations among a national sample of telestroke sites on one of the most commonly used common vendor platforms, prior to the COVID-19 public health emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial telestroke vendor provided data on all telestroke consultations by two specialist provider groups from 2013-2019. Kendall's   nonparametric test was utilized to assess time trends. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between hospital consult utilization and alteplase use adjusting for hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Among 67,736 telestroke consultations to 132 spoke sites over the study period, most occurred in the emergency department (90%) and for stroke indications (final clinical diagnoses: TIA 13%, ischemic stroke 39%, hemorrhagic stroke 2%, stroke mimics 46%). Stroke severity was low (median NIHSS 2, IQR 0C6). Alteplase was recommended for 23% of ischemic stroke patients. From 2013 to 2019, times from ED arrival to NIHSS, CT scan, imaging review, consult, and alteplase administration all decreased (p<0.05 for all), while times from consult start to alteplase recommendation and bolus increased (p<0.01 for both). Transfer was recommended for 8% of ischemic stroke patients. Number of patients treated with alteplase per hospital increased with increasing number of consults and hospital size and was also associated with US region in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Longer duration of hospital participation in the network was associated with shorter hospital median door-to-needle time for alteplase delivery (39 min shorter per year, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Among spoke sites using a commercial telestroke platform over a seven-year time horizon, times to consult start and alteplase bolus decreased over time. Similar to academic networks, duration of telestroke participation in this commercial network was associated with faster alteplase delivery, suggesting practice improves performance.","output":"National Trends in Telestroke Utilization in a US Commercial Platform Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of the IDEA syringe services program medical student-run free clinic in Miami, Florida. In an effort to continue to serve the community of people who inject drugs and practice compassionate and non-judgmental care, the students transitioned the clinic to a model of TeleMOUD (medications for opioid use disorder). We describe development and implementation of a medical student-run telemedicine clinic through an academic medical center-operated syringe services program. METHODS: Students advertised TeleMOUD services at the syringe service program on social media and created an online sign-up form. They coordinated appointments and interviewed patients by phone or videoconference where they assessed patients for opioid use disorder. Supervising attending physicians also interviewed patients and prescribed buprenorphine when appropriate. Students assisted patients in obtaining medication from the pharmacy and provided support and guidance during home buprenorphine induction. RESULTS: Over the first 9 weeks in operation, 31 appointments were requested, and 22 initial telehealth appointments were completed by a team of students and attending physicians. Fifteen appointments were for MOUD and 7 for other health issues. All patients seeking MOUD were prescribed buprenorphine and 12/15 successfully picked up medications from the pharmacy.

Parthenolide shows the best binding affinity with both main protease (M(pro)) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)). The molecular electrostatic potential and Mulliken atomic charges of the Parthenolide molecule shows the high chemical reactivity of the molecule. The docking of Parthenolide with PL(pro) give score of ?8.0 kcal/mol that validates the good binding of Parthenolide molecule with PL(pro). This complex was further considered for molecular dynamics simulations. The binding energy of the complex seems to range in between ?3.85 to ?11.07 kcal/mol that is high enough to validate the stability of the complex.

In this report, we first demonstrate that the RT-PCR-RFLP was sensitive in detecting both Massachusetts 41 (Mass 41) and JMK strains of IBV singly; the detection limit for both was approximately 0.15ng viral RNA using gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the ability of the technique to semi-quantify the relative amounts of Mass 41 and JMK RNA in their mixture was shown by performing RT-PCR-RFLP on various combinations of serially diluted known amounts of Mass 41 and JMK RNA. Results indicated that both Mass 41 and JMK can be detected and semi-quantified when there is less than 10(3)-fold difference between the two viral RNA template inputs, which are above the lower detection limit. Based on this result, the interaction between Mass 41 and JMK in ovo was examined by inoculating 10-day-old embryos with various combinations of different EID(50) titers of Mass 41 and JMK. RT-PCR-RFLP results showed that Mass 41 dominates over JMK in an EID(50) titerdependent fashion, but not the reverse. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, replication efficiency of Mass 41 and JMK was compared at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48h after inoculation of embryos with 10(5.3) EID(50) of individual Mass 41 and JMK.

The current study investigated whether this change in treatment format was maintained after one year of the COVID-19 pandemic. From 16 February until 2 April 2021, a total of 238 Austrian psychotherapists completed an online survey. They were asked about the number of patients currently treated in-person, via telephone and via the internet. Psychotherapists rated three different aspects of psychotherapy (ability to actively listen to patients, ability to understand what is going on in the patients and ability to support patients emotionally) for three different formats (in-person with facemasks, telephone and internet) separately. The results show that, after one year of the pandemic, the majority (78.4%) of patients were treated in-person (compared to 21.7% during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic; p < 0.001). This change in the treatment format was accompanied by a strong increase in the total number of patients treated by 77.2% on average (p < 0.001). Psychotherapists reported no differences between in-person psychotherapy with facemasks and psychotherapy via the internet with regard to the three investigated aspects of psychotherapy, while the surveyed aspects were rated less favorably for psychotherapy conducted via telephonic communication (p < 0.05).

Stent retrievers lead to faster and more complete reperfusion than previous technologies. Our aim is to compare the cost-effectiveness of stent retrievers to the previous mechanical thrombectomy devices. METHODS Retrospective review of endovascularly treated large-vessel AIS. Data from all consecutive patients who underwent thrombectomy from January 2012 through November 2012 were collected. Baseline characteristics, the total procedural cost, the rates of successful recanalization [modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) scores of 2b or 3], and the length of stay at the hospital were compared between the stent retriever (SR) and the non-stent retriever (NSR) groups. RESULTS After excluding the patients who underwent concomitant extracranial stenting (n = 22) or received intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator only (n = 6), the entire cohort included 150 patients. The cost of the reperfusion procedure was significantly higher in the SR compared to the NSR group (USD 13,419 vs. 9,308, p <0.001). We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the rates of mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion (81 vs. 74%, p = 0.337) or the length of stay (11.1  9.1 vs. 12.8  9.6 days, p = 0.260) amongst the SR and the NSR patients. CONCLUSION The procedural costs of thrombectomy for AIS are increasing and account for the bulk of hospitalization reimbursement. The impact of these expenditures in the long-term sustainability of stroke centers deserves greater consideration. While it is likely that the SR technology results in higher rates of optimal reperfusion, better clinical outcomes, and shorter lengths of stay, larger studies are needed to prove its cost-effectiveness.","output":"Periprocedural cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in the stent retriever era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) viral pandemic, there is uncertainty whether biologic agents for psoriasis may place patients at a higher risk for infection or more severe disease course.

At first sight this improving health situation follows the classical epidemiological transition model. Just three decades ago health in China was characterised by high rates of infectious disease and early mortality (diseases of poverty) in a mainly peasant society. More recently infectious disease rates have decreased, with corresponding and extended morbidity and mortality associated with an aging population in a rapidly urbanising society. This process has given rise to new health problems, including chronic and degenerative diseases (diseases of affluence). Nonetheless, while there is some validity in the application of the epidemiological transition concept, further analysis demonstrates that China faces a new epidemiological phase, characterised by increasing life expectancy and diseases of affluence coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that Chinas state policy plays a major role in defining the parameters of health in a Chinese context. We conclude that, today, China is faced with a new set of health issues, including the impact of smoking, hypertension, the health effects of environmental pollution and the rise of HIV/AIDS; however, state policy remains vital to the health of Chinas vast population. The challenge for policy is to maintain health reform whilst tackling the problems associated with rapid urbanisation, widening social and spatial inequalities and the emergence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.","output":"Changing health in China: re-evaluating the epidemiological transition model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The derivatives of quercetin is known for their immune-modulating antiviral, anti-blood clotting, antioxidant, and also for its anti-inflammatory efficacy. The current study was therefore conducted to examine the noted novel derivatives of quercetin present in plant sources as an immune modulator and as an antiviral molecule in the COVID-19 disease and also to study their affinity of binding with potential three targets reported for coronavirus, i.e., papain-like protease, spike protein receptor-binding domain, and 3C-like protease. Based on the high-positive drug-likeness score, the reported derivatives of quercetin obtained from an open-source database were further filtered. Compounds with positive and high drug-likeness scores were further predicted for their potential targets using DIGEP-Pred software, and STRING was used to evaluate the interaction between modulated proteins. The associated pathways were recorded based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. Docking was performed finally using PyRx having AutoDock Vina to identify the efficacy of binding between quercetin derivatives with papain-like protease, spike protein receptor-binding domain, and 3C-like protease. The ligand that scored minimum binding energy was chosen to visualize the interaction between protein and ligand. Normal mode analysis in internal coordinates was done with normal mode analysis to evaluate the physical movement and stability of the best protein-ligand complexes using the iMODS server. RESULTS: Forty bioactive compounds with the highest positive drug-likeness scores were identified.

Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. METHODS: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process. RESULTS: For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out. CONCLUSION: In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"A prospect on the use of antiviral drugs to control local outbreaks of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been established as a prognostic indicator given its differential expression in COVID-19 patients.

A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation.

PURPOSE To compare technical success and accuracy of hepatic thermoablation using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired 24 h after ablation with regard to evaluation of the post-interventional ablation zone and local tumor recurrence (LTR), and to assess whether additional MRI within 24 h is beneficial. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two patients (23 men, 9 women; mean age, 60 years) with 48 lesions were included in this retrospective study. CT was performed immediately and MRI was performed 24 h after ablation. Diameter and volume calculations of the ablation zone were compared (T-Test). Technical success and ablation margin distinction, shape, and configuration were evaluated (-statistic). Local effectiveness was calculated based on follow-up imaging. Technical success and ablation margin features were correlated with LTR (log-rank test, Fisher's exact test). RESULTS Ablation zone volumes were significantly higher with MRI compared to CT (P < 0.05; mean volume, 55.19 and 45.97 mL). Agreement between CT and MRI for technical success was good ( = 0.801) and for margin conspicuity fair ( = 0.289). LTR was 26.1% (mean follow-up, 11.7 months). LTR showed no correlation with technical success or margin conspicuity. CONCLUSION CT and MRI are suited for early evaluation of technical success after thermoablation. Within 24 h a significant increase of the ablation volume is observed, which has to be taken into account when interpreting immediate postprocedural imaging and treating lesions near critical structures.

RESULTS: A total of 234 respondents from 225 centers and 49 countries spanning six continents completed the first round of the online survey, of which 79% (n = 184) completed round 2. There was variation in the availability of staging investigations ranging from 26.5% for endoscopic ultrasound to 62.8% for spiral computed tomography scan. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was offered in 14.8% (adenocarcinoma) and 47.0% (squamous cell carcinoma) of respondents and significantly increased by almost three-fold and two-fold, respectively, in both round 1 and 2. There were uncertainty and heterogeneity surrounding prioritization of patients undergoing cancer resections.

Outcomes from infection with Omicron remain uncertain. We evaluated whether clinical outcomes and viral loads differed between Delta and Omicron infections during the period when both variants were co-circulating. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, remnant clinical specimens, positive for SARS-CoV-2 after standard of care testing at the Johns Hopkins Microbiology Laboratory, between the last week of November and the end of December 2021, were used for whole viral genome sequencing. Cycle threshold values (Ct) for viral RNA, the presence of infectious virus, and levels of respiratory IgG were measured, and clinical outcomes were obtained. Differences in each measure were compared between variants stratified by vaccination status. FINDINGS: The Omicron variant displaced Delta during the study period and constituted 95% of the circulating lineages by the end of December 2021. Patients with Omicron infections (N = 1,119) were more likely to be vaccinated compared to patients with Delta (N = 908), but were less likely to be admitted (0.33 CI 0.21C0.52), require ICU level care (0.38 CI 0.17C0.87), or succumb to infection (0.26 CI 0.06C1.02) regardless of vaccination status. There was no statistically significant difference in Ct values based on the lineage regardless of the vaccination status. Recovery of infectious virus in cell culture was reduced in boosted patients compared to fully vaccinated without a booster and unvaccinated when infected with the Delta lineage. However, in patients with Omicron infections, recovery of infectious virus was not affected by vaccination. INTERPRETATION: Compared to Delta, Omicron was more likely to cause breakthrough infections of vaccinated individuals, yet admissions were less frequent. Admitted patients might develop severe disease comparable to Delta. Efforts for reducing Omicron transmission are required as, though the admission risk might be lower, the increased numbers of infections cause large numbers of hospitalizations.

We developed a social welfare policy analysis framework based on Gilberts framework, designed interview outlines and conducted a thematic analysis of the interview data along five dimensions: allocation base, type of provision, delivery strategy, finance mode, and external environment. The results of the research indicate that the coverage of the system is narrow and that disability assessment criteria are fragmented; that the substance of service provision is lacking, both in terms of precision and dynamic adjustment mechanisms; that socialized care synergy cannot be achieved, informal care lacking policy support; that there is an over-reliance on medical insurance funds and that unfair financing standards are applied; and that economic and social development is insufficient to cope with ageing needs and uncertain risks. Accordingly, this research proposes several optimization options to promote the full establishment of LTCI.","output":"Long-Term Care Insurance Pilot Programme in China: Policy Evaluation and Optimization OptionsTaking the Pilot Programme in the Northeast of China as an Example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented extraordinary challenges to worldwide healthcare systems, however, prevalence remains low in some countries. While the challenges of conducting research in high-prevalence countries are well published, there is a paucity from low COVID-19 countries. METHODS: A PRISMA guided systematic review was conducted using the databases Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles discussing ethical issues relating to research in low prevalence COVID-19 countries. RESULTS: The search yielded 133 original articles of which only 2 fit the inclusion criteria and aim, with neither specific to low prevalence. Most of the available literature focused on clinical management and resource allocation related to high prevalence countries. These results will be discussed under the ethical dimensions of equity, individual liberty, privacy and confidentiality, proportionality, public protection, provision of care, reciprocity, stewardship and trust.. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review failed to identify articles relating to COVID-19 research ethics, specific to low prevalence countries. It shows that there is a significant gap in the literature that warrants further investigation. Common ethical principles were used to present a distinct set of challenges experienced by a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19. This unique perspective of some of the common ethical problems surrounding research, may help guide further discussion and guide research in similar countries.","output":"Systematic review: bioethical implications for COVID-19 research in low prevalence countries, a distinctly different set of problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiation therapy has an important role in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and can be used alone or in conjunction with surgery and/or systemic chemotherapy.

The development and equitable distribution of a vaccine seems to be the most promising and sustainable route ahead. The goal of this study was to explore older adults attitudes towards and beliefs regarding the Covid-19 vaccination in Southern Switzerland. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study employing telephone interviews to understand older adults attitudes towards and beliefs about the Covid-19 vaccine. No Covid-19 vaccine had yet been approved at the moment of data collection. A convenience and snowball sample of 19 participants was recruited. Participants had to be at least 65 years old, without any hearing impairments, and be resident in the Canton of Ticino. RESULTS: Most participants were women (n = 12), Swiss nationals (n = 14), retired (n = 18), resident in urban areas (n = 14), and had obtained a secondary school degree (n = 14). The average age was 75 (SD = 6.04; range = 64C85). We found that the majority of participants were in favor of the vaccination and highlighted its positive consequences, such as the abandonment of current freedom-limiting protective measures. Those participants who were against or unsure about the vaccination had concerns regarding the novelty of the vaccine and its impact on its safety and efficacy, stated they would prefer other protective measures rather than the vaccination, and identified contextual and individual drivers of their concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Independently from the outbreaks trajectory, efforts to foster vaccination acceptance should focus on the benefit of relapsing freedom-limiting protective measures. Vaccination strategies should be grounded in an evidence-based, participatory approach, ongoing community engagement, trust-building activities, and communication about vaccine developments and how the vaccine will be combined with other outbreak response measures.","output":"Willingness to vaccinate against Covid-19: A qualitative study involving older adults from Southern Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was most recently discovered, quickly evolved into a global pandemic. Studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms. This study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall COVID-19 cases and related deaths across states in the United States. General regression and Chi-square tests were used to examine those associations. The analyses indicated that obesity prevalence (%) across states were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.0448) and related deaths (p = 0.0181), with a decrease of 158 cases/100K population and 13 deaths/100K for every 5% increase of the obesity prevalence. When the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence (30.9%) into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence, both the cases (671 vs 416 cases/100k population) and deaths (39 vs 21 deaths/100k population) were significantly different (p < 0.001) across groups. These findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and COVID-19. These results should not currently be considered as an indication that obesity is a protective factor for COVID-19, and would rather be used as a warning of the public advice that obese people is more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, which may lead to a false safety message probably given to people with normal body weight.","output":"Implications of the reverse associations between obesity prevalence and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and related deaths in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: O presente estudo buscou analisar a suscetibilidade pela infeco por SARS-CoV-2 entre a tipagem sangunea com base em estudos publicados.

It is a complementary tool to support COVID-19 identification in areas with no access to radiology specialists or RT-PCR tests. We encourage the use of the algorithm to support COVID-19 screening, for educational purposes, as a baseline for further enhancements, and as a benchmark for different solutions. The algorithm is currently being tested in clinical practice in a hospital in Esprito Santo, Brazil.Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of reports present deep learning algorithms that support the detection of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Few studies have provided the complete source code, limiting testing and reproducibility on different datasets. This work presents Cimatec_XCOV19, a novel deep learning system inspired by the Inception-V3 architecture that is able to (i) support the identification of abnormal chest radiographs and (ii) classify the abnormal radiographs as suggestive of COVID-19. The training dataset has 44,031 images with 2917 COVID-19 cases, one of the largest datasets in recent literature. We organized and published an external validation dataset of 1158 chest radiographs from a Brazilian hospital. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated the radiographs. The Cimatec_XCOV19 algorithm obtained a sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.82, and AUC ROC of 0.93. We compared the AUC ROC of our algorithm with a well-known public solution and did not find a statistically relevant difference between both performances. We provide full access to the code and the test dataset, enabling this work to be used as a tool for supporting the fast screening of COVID-19 on chest X-ray exams, serving as a reference for educators, and supporting further algorithm enhancements.","output":"Deep Learning Applied to Chest Radiograph ClassificationA COVID-19 Pneumonia Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Cabin Fever Syndrome(CFS) describes a group of mental health symptoms that people may experience when they are confined over weeks in their residence for extended periods, such as the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Indoor Environment Quality(IEQ) may also affect psychological health problems. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that IEQ problems may be related to the occurrence of CFS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 360 full-time working-from-home workers during lockdown in Bangkok, who were selected via the occupational health(OH) of the work from home project. The data was obtained by a self-administrated online questionnaire. The demographic data and the eight self-perceived IEQ problems, the occurrence of CFS and coping methods were analyzed. Results: CFS was commonly and significantly found among younger people, but there were no differences in terms of gender, education, personality type and accommodation type. The most common IEQ-related problem was an inappropriate temperature. The perception of IEQ problems was risky in terms of CFS occurrence with p< 0.05. This study also found the dose-response between a number of IEQ problems and CFS with p for trend <0.001, but did not identify the specific association with any IEQ problems. There were various coping activities that could decrease CFS, but only their time management was significant at p< 0.05. Conclusions: IEQ problems may be an important factor that may be related to occurrences of CFS.

However, in contrast to conventional 1D- and 3D-networked macromolecules, the synthesis of such 2D networks provides challenges for polymer chemists because of the nature of the networking polymerisation reaction, which occurs in a spatially random fashion when conventional solution-phase synthesis is performed. Here we report a versatile synthesis of polymeric monosheets with unimolecularly thick networking architectures by exploiting the 2D nanospaces of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as reaction templates. Crosslinking radical polymerisation in the 2D nanospaces of pillared-layer-type MOFs affords monosheets of typical vinyl polymers and can be carried out on the gram scale. Remarkably, the prepared polymer monosheets are highly soluble in organic solvents and show atypical thermal and rheological properties that result from their 2D-regulated conformations that cannot be adopted by their 1D or 3D analogues.","output":"Unimolecularly thick monosheets of vinyl polymers fabricated in metal-organic frameworks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide.

In this study, the author discusses corruption in infrastructure development in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of research is library research using the juridical-normative type of research, namely research that is focused on examining the causal factors, punishments given and examining the implications of corruption in infrastructure development on the economy and education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data in this study is secondary data, namely library materials that include official documents, journals, books, libraries, scientific works, articles, and documents related to this research material. The results of this paper indicate that: 1) Factors causing corruption in infrastructure development during the COVID-19 pandemic can occur for various reasons, both from within the perpetrator (internal) or from outside the perpetrator (external). 2). The KPK emphasized that it would give the death penalty to those who commit criminal acts of corruption, especially when the country is in a state of disaster or economic crisis. However, it is all in the judge's decision which decides whether a severe or light sentence is given in giving sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Law Number 31 of 1999 and Law Number 20 of 2021 concerning the eradication of corruption. 3). The implications of corruption in infrastructure development on the economy and education are very negative. The consequences of corruption in infrastructure development can result in access to mobility being unresolved, so that the community's economy becomes bad and unstable.

Since, no specific antiviral drug is proven effective for treatment against COVID-19, identification of new therapeutics is an urgent need. In this study, flavonoid compounds were analyzed for its inhibitory potential against important protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. Virtual docking was performed for screening of flavonoid compounds retrieved from PubChem against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using COVID-19 docking server. The cut off of dock score was set to >-9kcal/mol and screened compounds were individually docked against main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike proteins using AutoDock 4.1 software. Finally, lead flavonoid compounds were subjected to ADMET analysis. A total of 458 flavonoid compounds were virtually screened against main protease target and 36 compounds were selected based on the interaction energy value >-9kcal/mol. Furthermore, these compounds were individually docked against protein targets and top 10 lead compounds were identified. Among the lead compounds, agathisflavone showed highest binding energy value of -8.4 kcal/mol against main protease, Albireodelphin showed highest dock score of -9.8 kcal/mol and -11.2 kcal/mol against RdRp, and spike proteins, respectively.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of generalised, exclusively email-based prompts versus a personalised remote knowledge broker for delivering evidence-based mood management interventions within an existing smoking cessation programme in primary care settings. METHODS: The study design is a cluster randomised controlled trial of 123 Ontario Family Health Teams participating in the Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients programme. They were randomly allocated 1:1 for healthcare providers to receive either: a remote knowledge broker offering tailored support via phone and email (group A), or a generalised monthly email focused on tobacco and depression treatment (group B), to encourage the implementation of an evidence-based mood management intervention to smokers presenting depressive symptoms. The primary outcome was participants acceptance of a self-help mood management resource. The secondary outcome was smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up, measured by self-report of smoking abstinence for at least 7 previous days. The tertiary outcome was the costs of delivering each intervention arm, which, together with the effectiveness outcomes, were used to undertake a cost minimisation analysis. RESULTS: Between February 2018 and January 2019, 7175 smokers were screened for depression and 2765 (39%) reported current/past depression. Among those who reported current/past depression, 29% (437/1486) and 27% (345/1277) of patients accepted the mood management resource in group A and group B, respectively. The adjusted generalised estimating equations showed that there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in patients odds of accepting the mood management resource or in the patients odds of smoking abstinence at follow-up. The cost minimisation analysis showed that the email strategy was the least costly option. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants did not accept the resource regardless of remote knowledge broker strategy. In contexts with an existing KT infrastructure, decision-makers should consider an email strategy when making changes to a programme given its lower cost compared with other strategies.

These challenges result in evidence-to-practice gaps that diminish the impact of proven-effective interventions for patients requiring intensive care unit support. Research is needed to understand and address implementation determinants in critical care settings. METHODS: The Handoffs and Transitions in Critical CareUnderstanding Scalability (HATRICC-US) study is a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of standardized operating room (OR) to intensive care unit (ICU) handoffs. This mixed methods study will use a stepped wedge design with randomized roll out to test the effectiveness of a customized protocol for structuring communication between clinicians in the OR and the ICU. The study will be conducted in twelve ICUs (10 adult, 2 pediatric) based in five United States academic health systems. Contextual inquiry incorporating implementation science, systems engineering, and human factors engineering approaches will guide both protocol customization and identification of protocol implementation determinants. Implementation mapping will be used to select appropriate implementation strategies for each setting. Human-centered design will be used to create a digital toolkit for dissemination of study findings. The primary implementation outcome will be fidelity to the customized handoff protocol (unit of analysis: handoff). The primary effectiveness outcome will be a composite measure of new-onset organ failure cases (unit of analysis: ICU). DISCUSSION: The HATRICC-US study will customize, implement, and evaluate standardized procedures for OR to ICU handoffs in a heterogenous group of United States academic medical center intensive care units. Findings from this study have the potential to improve postsurgical communication, decrease adverse clinical outcomes, and inform the implementation of other evidence-based practices in critical care settings.

The basic reproduction number has been derived and the contribution of each infectious compartment towards the generation of new COVID-19 cases is ascertained. Data fitting was performed and parameter values were estimated within plausible ranges. Numerical simulations performed suggest that control measures that decrease the effective contact radius and increase the transmission rate exponent will be greatly beneficial in the control of COVID-19 in the presence of superspreading phenomena.","output":"Modelling the potential role of super spreaders on COVID-19 transmission dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report highlights the case of a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and resultant bronchiectasis who was discharged from hospital after recovering from real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR positive COVID-19 infection having had a subsequent negative swab and resolution of symptoms, but was readmitted 3 weeks later with recrudescent symptoms and a further positive swab. Although there are reports of COVID-19 infection in XLA, for the first time we report a case of possible reinfection.

Public transportation is not only a bridge through which infections travel from one location to another but also a place where infections occur since individuals are typically in close proximity to each other due to the limited space in these systems. A mathematical model is constructed to study the spread of an infectious disease through such systems. A variant of the next generation method is proposed and used to provide upper and lower bounds of the basic reproduction number for the model. Our investigation indicates that increasing transportation efficiency, and improving sanitation and ventilation of the public transportation system decrease the chance of an outbreak occurring. Moreover, discouraging unnecessary travel during an epidemic also decreases the chance of an outbreak. However, reducing travel by infectives while allowing susceptibles to travel may not be enough to avoid an outbreak.","output":"Spatial spread of an epidemic through public transportation systems with a hub"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid increases in the number of COVID-19 cases have led to the closure of academic institutions including elementary and high schools.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implications of previous treatment with ACEI/ARB on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: Single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study based on all the inhabitants of our health area. Analyses of main outcomes (mortality, heart failure, hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, and major acute cardiovascular events [a composite of mortality and heart failure]) were adjusted by multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching models. Results: Of the total population, 447 979 inhabitants, 965 patients (0.22%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and 210 (21.8%) were under ACEI or ARB treatment at the time of diagnosis.

Methods: COVID-19 patients were assessed using nationwide health insurance data. COPD patients were operationally defined. Comorbidities were evaluated by using the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (mCCI) which excluded the factors of COPD from conventional CCI scores. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19, such as mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, were assessed. Subgroup analysis about the effect of inhaled corticosteroid of COPD patients on COVID-19 was performed. Results: COPD group were older (71.311.6 vs. 47.719.1, p < 0.001) and have higher CCI scores (2.61.9 vs. 0.81.3, p < 0.001) than non-COPD group.

Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) might serve as migraine biomarkers due to their roles in migraine pathophysiology. However, their diagnostic usefulness has not been explored yet. Present study explored the diagnostic accuracy of CGRP and ApoE in migraine. METHODS: A cross-sectional, caseCcontrol study was conducted from November 2019 to April 2020 at Physiology department of our university. Fourteen female migraine patients, 18C25 years old, with confirmed Migraine diagnosis by a neurologist, were recruited. Control group consisted of 14 age-matched healthy females with no personal/family history of migraine. Blood was drawn once from control subjects and twice from migraine patients (ictal and interictal phase). Serum CGRP and ApoE levels were assessed by ELISA. Statistical analysis involved paired t-test, one-way ANOVA, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and cross-tabs. RESULTS: ApoE (mg/dl) was higher significantly in interictal (1.900.50) and ictal (1.970.65) phases of migraine compared to control (1.070.26) (p  0.001). ROC curves for ApoE were significant in migraine ictal vs control (AUC= 0.91, AUC 95% CI: 0.78C1.0) and migraine interictal vs control (AUC=0.92, AUC 95% CI: 0.8C1.0) subjects.

These policies have prompted ethical, scientific, practical, and political controversy;however, there has been limited evaluation of their potential unintended consequences. Here, we outline a comprehensive set of hypotheses for why these policies may be counter-productive and harmful. Our framework considers four domains: 1) behavioral psychology, 2) politics and law, 3) socioeconomics, and 4) the integrity of science and public health. While COVID-19 vaccines have had a profound impact on decreasing global morbidity and mortality burdens, we argue that current population-wide mandatory vaccine policies are scientifically questionable, ethically problematic, and misguided. Such policies may lead to detrimental long-term impacts on uptake of future public health measures, including COVID-19 vaccines themselves as well as routine immunizations. Restricting peoples access to work, education, public transport, and social life based on COVID-19 vaccination status impinges on human rights, promotes stigma and social polarization, and adversely affects health and wellbeing. Mandating vaccination is one of the most powerful interventions in public health and should be used sparingly and carefully to uphold ethical norms and trust in scientific institutions. We argue that current COVID-19 vaccine policies should be reevaluated in light of negative consequences that may outweigh benefits. Leveraging empowering strategies based on trust and public consultation represent a more sustainable approach for protecting those at highest risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and the health and wellbeing of the public.","output":"The Unintended Consequences of COVID-19 Vaccine Policy: Why Mandates, Passports, and Segregated Lockdowns May Cause more Harm than Good (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To date, only monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective for outpatients with COVID-19. Interferon lambda-1 is a type III interferon involved in innate antiviral responses with activity against respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon lambda in the treatment of outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 g or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation list created with a randomisation schedule in blocks of four. At the time of administration, study nurses received a sealed opaque envelope with the treatment allocation number. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on day 7 after the injection, analysed by a &#967;2 test following an intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, adjusted for baseline viral load, using bivariate logistic regression was done. The trial is now complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354259. FINDINGS: Between May 18, and Sept 4, 2020, we recruited 30 patients per group. The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 242 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=00041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=015). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 412 [95% CI 115-1673; p=0029). Of those with baseline viral load above 106 copies per mL, 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the peginterferon lambda group had undetectable virus on day 7, compared with six (38%) of 16 in the placebo group (OR 625 [95% CI 149-3106]; p=0012). Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group. Two individuals met the threshold of grade 3 increase, one in each group, and no other grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Peginterferon lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19, increasing the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, particularly in those with high baseline viral load. Peginterferon lambda has potential to prevent clinical deterioration and shorten duration of viral shedding.

In this symposium we investigate how the pandemic and the public discourse about older adults has shaped views of aging in different countries. Bellingtier et al. report on German childrens views of older adults before and during the pandemic. Children placed greater distance between themselves and older adults both before and after the pandemic, suggesting early ageism in children that predates the pandemic.

Schwartz and Ayalon found that greater perceptions of age-based discrimination in the healthcare system by Israeli adults 50+ were significantly related to greater Covid-19 worries. Greater worry can motivate older adults to take precautions, but be detrimental if it becomes too high. In line with this finding, Tingvold et al. found in a study with older adults from Luxembourg that more Covid-19 worry predicted feeling older four months later, but only for those in worse health.

Prior to the pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Airports Council International, (ACI) and the respective industry, have expressed their concern that the then today's airport security model was not sustainable in the long term. The vision for a seamless and continuous journey throughout the airport and efficient security resources allocation based on intelligent risk analysis, set the challenging objectives for the Smart Security of the airport of the future. Several projects, such as FLYSEC and TRESSPASS, have been funded by the European Commission (EU) to develop and demonstrate innovative integrated and risk-based end-to-end airport security processes for passengers, while enabling a guided and streamlined procedure from landside to airside and into the boarding gates, offering for the first time an operationally validated innovative concept for end-to-end aviation security. Ironically, the Covid-19 pandemic has put air, but also sea and land, travelling to an almost complete stand-still that has, temporarily at least, muted the debate about alternative security protocols and processes for accommodating ever increasing passenger flows more effectively. Despite the dramatically reduced passenger flows, the concept of risk-based security remains valid both as a research topic and a valid security doctrine that can increase security efficacy.

Here, we present an analysis of a case series of the first 20 patients data collected in clinical practice to evaluate the potential of a possible alternative treatment for Long COVID. METHODS: Face-to-face treatment sessions with Perrin technique practitioners occurred weekly involving effleurage/other manual articulatory techniques. The individuals being treated also undertook daily self-massage along with gentle mobility exercises. Patients recorded symptom severity using the self-report 54-item profile of fatigue-related states (PFRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of male patients was 41.8 years (range, 29C53 years), and for female patients, 39.3 years (range, 28C50 years). None of the participants had a prior diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, and all were new attendees to the clinics at the time of initial assessment. The average number of treatment sessions was 9.7 in men and 9.4 in women. The reduction in PFRS scores was 45% in men and 52% in women. The highest subscale scores on average were for fatigue, with the lowest for somatic symptoms. All subscale scores showed, on average, a similar reduction of approximately 50% postintervention, with the reduction in score relating to a decrease in the severity of symptoms.

Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed diffuse thickening and enlargement of the infundibulum with homogenous contrast enhancement of the hypophyseal axis. Based on the suspicion for lymphocytic hypophysitis, she was started on Methylprednisolone 250 mg IV Q6hrs on day 1-3. Symptomatic clinical improvement was seen on day 3 with a significant decrease in the intensity of the headache. Conclusion: The case illustrates the varied presentation and neurological sequalae associated with the COVID-19 virus.

Antibiotics are often inappropriately used for the treatment of pharyngitis, which can contribute to antimicrobial resistance, therefore non-antibiotic treatments which have broad antiseptic effects may be more appropriate. Amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) are present in some antiseptic lozenges and have established benefits in providing symptomatic relief and some in vitro antiviral action. METHODS: Seven bacterial species associated with pharyngitis, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and Staphylococcus aureus, were exposed to an AMC/DCBA lozenge dissolved in artificial saliva. In vitro bactericidal activity was measured as a log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs). RESULTS: Bactericidal activity was recorded against all organisms after 1 minute. Greater than 3 log(10) reductions in CFUs were observed at 1 minute for S. pyogenes (log(10) reduction CFU/mL  SD, 5.70.1), H. influenza (6.10.1), A. haemolyticum (6.50.0) and F. necrophorum (6.50.0), at 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae (6.30.0) and M. catarrhalis (5.00.9) and at 10 minutes for S. aureus (3.50.1). CONCLUSION: An AMC/DCBA lozenge demonstrated a greater than 99.9% reduction in CFUs against all tested species within 10 minutes, which is consistent with the time a lozenge remains in the mouth. Patients with uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis may benefit from the antibacterial action of antiseptic AMC/DCBA lozenges. Furthermore, AMC/DCBA lozenges may be more relevant and appropriate than antibiotics for pharyngitis associated with a self-limiting viral URTI.","output":"Spectrum of bactericidal action of amylmetacresol/2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol lozenges against oropharyngeal organisms implicated in pharyngitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Montreal is the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada with highest number of deaths.

The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability.

Modelling is possible because epidemics involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. Modelling aims to explain and predict trends in disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality. Epidemic models give important insight into the development of an epidemic. Following disease establishment, epidemic growth is approximately exponential. The rate of growth in this phase is primarily determined by the basic reproduction number, R(0), the number of secondary cases per primary case when the population is susceptible. R(0) also determines the ease with which control policies can control an epidemic. Once a significant proportion of the population has been infected, not all contacts of an infected individual will be with susceptible people. Infection can now continue only because new births replenish the susceptible population. Eventually an endemic equilibrium is reached where every infected person infects one other individual on average. Heterogeneity in host susceptibility, infectiousness, human contact patterns and in the genetic composition of pathogen populations introduces substantial additional complexity into this picture, however C and into the models required to model real diseases realistically. This chapter concludes with a brief review of the recent application of mathematical models to a wide range of emerging human or animal epidemics, most notably the spread of HIV in Africa, the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in British livestock, bioterrorism threats such as smallpox, the SARS epidemics in 2003 and most recently the use of modelling as a tool for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.","output":"Mathematical prediction in infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 in 2020 has brought a profound impact on the global economy and forced countries around the world to adopt different intervention measures Has COVID-19 and these government interventions affected exchange rate volatility?

The C-Man-Trp structure can be found as a monomeric form or a part of post-translational modifications within polypeptide chains in living organisms. However, the mechanism of how monomeric C-Man-Trp is produced has not been fully investigated. In this study, we assessed levels of cellular C-Man-Trp by ultra performance liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry assay system, and investigated whether the cellular C-Man-Trp is affected by autophagy induction. The intracellular C-Man-Trp level was significantly increased under serum and/or amino acid starvation in A549, HaCaT, HepG2, NIH3T3, and NRK49F cells. The increase in C-Man-Trp was also observed in NIH3T3 cells treated with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. The up-regulation of C-Man-Trp caused by starvation was reversed by the inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. We further showed that C-Man-Trp is produced by incubating a synthetic C-mannosylated peptide (C-Man-Trp-Ser-Pro-Trp) or thrombospondin (TSP) in a lysosomal fraction that was prepared from a mouse liver, which provides supporting evidence that C-Man-Trp is a degradation product of the C-mannosylated peptide or protein following lysosome-related proteolysis.

Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine-tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position.

Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID-19-infected patients during disease but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID-19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID-19 convalescent patients. METHODS: We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples and determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels against the S-protein, its RBD-subunit, and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients who had mild disease ~10 weeks after infection (n = 109) and healthy control subjects (n = 98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters. RESULTS: Even ten weeks after disease COVID-19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID-19-infected patients both CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ effector memory cells were higher, while CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19-infected patients.

With pressures to reduce the number of in-person ambulatory visits, innovative models of telemonitoring have been used during the pandemic as a necessary alternative to support access to care for patients with chronic conditions. The pandemic has led health care organizations to consider the adoption of telemonitoring interventions for the first time, while others have seen existing programs rapidly expand. OBJECTIVE: At the Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid expansion of a telemonitoring program began on March 9, 2020, in response to COVID-19. The objective of this study was to understand the experiences related to the expanded role of a telemonitoring program under the changing conditions of the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case qualitative study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Semistructured interviews probed the experiences of patients, clinicians, and program staff from the Medly telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis as well as Eakin and Gladstones value-adding approach to enhance the analytic interpretation of the study findings. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and operational staff (n=4). Four themes were identified: (1) providing care continuity through telemonitoring; (2) adapting telemonitoring operations for a more virtual health care system; (3) confronting virtual workflow challenges; and (4) fostering a meaningful patient-provider relationship. Beyond supporting virtual visits, the programs ability to provide a more comprehensive picture of the patients health was valued. However, issues relating to the lack of system integration and alert-driven interactions jeopardized the perceived sustainability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: With the reduction of in-person visits during the pandemic, virtual services such as telemonitoring have demonstrated significant value. Based on our study findings, we offer recommendations to proactively adapt and scale telemonitoring programs under the changing conditions of an increasingly virtual health care system. These include revisiting the scope and expectations of telemedicine interventions, streamlining virtual patient onboarding processes, and personalizing the collection of patient information to build a stronger virtual relationship and a more holistic assessment of patient well-being.","output":"Expanding Telemonitoring in a Virtual World: A Case Study of the Expansion of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical decision\\\\making in kidney transplantation (KT) during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic is understandably a conundrum: both candidates and recipients may face increased acquisition risks and case fatality rates (CFRs).

A calculator was implemented (http://www.transplantmodels.com/covid_sim), and machine learning approaches were used to evaluate the important aspects of our modeling. Characteristics of the pandemic (acquisition risk, CFR) and length of delay (length of pandemic, waitlist priority when modeling deceased donor KT) had greatest influence on benefit/harm. In most scenarios of COVID\\\\19 dynamics and patient characteristics, immediate\\\\KT provided survival benefit; KT only began showing evidence of harm in scenarios where CFRs were substantially higher for KT recipients (e.g. 50% fatality) than for waitlist registrants. Our simulations suggest that KT could be beneficial in many centers if local resources allow, and our calculator can help identify patients who would benefit most. Furthermore, as the pandemic evolves, our calculator can update these predictions.","output":"Identifying scenarios of benefit or harm from kidney transplantation during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: a stochastic simulation and machine learning study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, health-care workers have been faced with an inordinately high level of trauma as frontline providers.

Primarily, our research on vaccine hesitancy focused on skepticism around the vaccine itself and its roll-out. Our search strategy used PUBMED and Google with a prescribed set of definitions and search terms for two reasons: there were limited peer-reviewed studies during early period of roll-out and real-time perspectives were crucially needed. Literature searches occurred in April 2021and covered September 2020-April 2021. Analyses included expert opinion, survey results and qualitative summaries. Overall, for the general U.S. population, there was considerable hesitancy initially that remained high during the early roll-out. The general population expressed concerns over the speed of vaccine development (warp speed), confidence in the competence of government being involved in the development of vaccines and general mistrust of government. Among Black and Hispanic Americans, hesitancy was further expressed as mistrust in the medical establishment that was related to past and current medical mistreatment. Undocumented immigrants worried about access to insurance and possible deportation. These results on confidence in the vaccine early during vaccine roll-out suggest diverse reasons that influence a persons decision to vaccinate or not. Additional barriers to vaccine uptake include complacency and access. To ensure health equity, particularly to address disparities in morbidity and mortality, vaccine hesitancy needs to be acknowledged and addressed as COVID-19 vaccine roll-out continues, and these observations calls for conscious planning to address these issues early with future health crises.","output":"Confidence and Hesitancy During the Early Roll-out of COVID-19 Vaccines Among Black, Hispanic, and Undocumented Immigrant Communities: a Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThe information on neurologic or psychiatric adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines is limited. Our objective was to examine the odds of neurological and psychiatric adverse reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsWe analyzed all Adverse Vaccine Reaction reports to the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between December 9, 2020 and June 30, 2021 that mentioned the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines. We compared the rates of adverse neurological and psychiatric reactions with ChAdOx1 to those with BNT162b2. P-values were obtained by a Bonferroni-adjusted Z-test for proportions. ResultsAs of June 30, 2021, 53.2 M doses of ChAdOx1 and 46.1 M doses of BNT162b2 had been administered. We extracted information from 300,518 distinct reports. The number of individual adverse neurologic or psychiatric reaction reports were less than 200/M doses administered, except headache which was reported in 1,550 and 395 cases/M doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, respectively. Compared to BNT162b2, cerebral hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, headaches and migraines, Guillain-Barre syndrome and paresthesias, tremor and freezing, delirium, hallucinations, nervousness, poor sleep quality, and postural dizziness were more frequently reported with ChAdOx1. Reactions more frequently reported with BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 were Bells palsy, facial paralysis, dysgeusia, anxiety, and presyncope or syncope. ConclusionSignificant differences in the neurologic and psychiatric adverse event profiles of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines may exist, emphasizing the need for additional research.

Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction.

The VS5E recognising CD13 was produced by immunising a doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7-ADr). A striking feature of this antibody was that it stained the doxorubicin resistant cells but not the parental cell line.

MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu(?)); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors. It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA. Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells. The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 10(34). Residual MDCK-DNA is 10 ng per dose and the ?-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200 base pairs (bp). Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses. The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses.

The virtual rounds decreased the physical contact between the HCWs, which could decrease the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spread among the treating team. Still, several components of the hybrid round should be optimized to facilitate the virtual team-members' interactions and enhance the teaching experience.","output":"Pediatric Intensive Care Hybrid-Style Clinical Round During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two main external developments marked the years 2019 and 2020 in Iran: the unilateral sanctions re-imposed by the United States in late 2018 after abandoning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and the COVID-19 Pandemic that had its first case in Iran in February 2020.

For India, reliable baseline prepandemic mortality patterns at national and subnational level are necessary for such assessments. However, available data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) is affected by incompleteness of death recording that varies by sex, age and location. METHODS: Under-reporting of CRS 2019 deaths was assessed for three age groups (< 5 years, 15C59 years and 60 years) at subnational level, through comparison with age-specific death rates from alternate sources. Age-specific corrections for under-reporting were applied to derive adjusted death counts by sex for each location. These were used to compute life expectancy (LE) at birth by sex in 2019, which were compared with subnational LEs from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 Study. RESULTS: A total of 9.92 million deaths (95% UI 9.70 to 10.02) were estimated across India in 2019, about 2.28 million more than CRS reports. Adjustments to under-five and elderly mortality accounted for 30% and 56% of additional deaths, respectively. Adjustments in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh accounted for 75% of all additional deaths. Adjusted LEs were below corresponding GBD estimates by 2 years for males at national level and in 20 states, and by 1 year for females in 12 states. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first-ever subnational mortality estimates for India derived from CRS reported deaths, and serve as a baseline for assessing excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted life expectancies indicate higher mortality patterns in India than previously perceived. Under-reporting of infant deaths and those among women and the elderly is evident in many locations. Further CRS strengthening is required to improve the empirical basis for local mortality measurement across the country.","output":"Subnational mortality estimates for India in 2019: a baseline for evaluating excess deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanohybrid membranes based on the Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) H(5)PV(2)Mo(10)O(40) and aminosilane-modified silicate (Ormosil and Ormosil(NR(4)(+)Cl(?))) hybrids were synthesized as a new barrier to protect against simulants of chemical and biological toxicant.

This has not only created a need for pain management specialists to learn about this potential indication for MMJ but also for them to have more detailed knowledge of patient attitudes and willingness to comply with providers recommendations regarding its safe use with other pain medications. For this purpose, we surveyed CP patients in a region severely affected by the opioid crisis in order to provide better education, formulate treatment plans, and develop clinical policies. METHODS: We designed and administered the Medical Marijuana Interest Questionnaire (MMIQ) online to patients of the Western Reserve Hospital Center for Pain Medicine (CPM) with a diagnosis of CP who were not yet using MMJ. Questions addressed demographic and clinical characteristics, willingness to consider MMJ, and compliance with treatment plans and concerns. We then carried out a statistical analysis including Pearson chi-square, Spearmans rho and Kendalls tau tests to measure associations between variables to identify factors that may influence willingness to use MMJ. RESULTS: After sending 1047 email invitations to complete the MMIQ, 242 (23.1%) completed questionnaires were returned. The average age range of all respondents was 51-60 years, 171 (70.7%) were female and 147 (60.7%) were current opioid users. The 204 (84.3%) respondents who were willing to consider using MMJ were given access to the entire questionnaire. Of these, 138 (67.6%) reported wanting to use less opioids after starting MMJ and 191 (93.6%) were amenable to following their pain specialists recommendations about using MMJ concurrently with opioids. Their greatest concern on a 0-5 scale was affordability (2.98) and there was a statistically significant negative correlation between older age and preference for inhaled forms (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The MMIQ was successful in eliciting important data regarding patients attitudes about MMJ for opioid titration and potential compliance. Our study was limited by being administered online rather than in-person, which skewed the demographic makeup of the sample. The MMIQ can be used to study similar populations or adapted to patients already using MMJ. Similar surveys of MMJ-experienced patients could be combined with chart reviews to study the success of these products for pain control and opioid substitution.","output":"Interests and concerns regarding medical marijuana among chronic pain patients in Ohio: an online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 24 continues to proliferate across the globe, it is a struggle to predict and prevent its spread.

During this time, policy reforms have ultimately landed care, and the business of providing it, within a market model. Following recent evidence produced by the Royal Commission into Aged Care and Safety and the COVID-19 Senate Committee, this model and the sector's incapacity to consistently deliver appropriate care has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and debate. The many COVID-19-related deaths of aged care residents have added to demands for urgent action to redress the sector's weaknesses, particularly those relating to workforce adequacy. This paper presents findings from a recent mixed methods study of community aged care provision by five providers who operate across a large rural part of regional Victoria. It utilises data to illustrate the impact of rural location on care provision, and significantly, on local capacity to maintain an appropriately skilled workforce. Demographic factors and funding shortfalls for consumers with multiple, complex care needs underscore the need for strategic planning to ensure workforce adequacy into the future. Encouragingly, our data showcase the many capacities of community aged services in this rural area and the opportunity to develop effective strategies relative to the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and the design of best practice models for meeting complex care needs. ? 2021 Institute of Public Administration Australia","output":"Australian rural community aged care services: Precarity and capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a known risk factor for respiratory infection and many other chronic diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, it has been considered an important and independent predictor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications in adults, especially cardiopulmonary, presenting in a great number of individuals in critical care. In obesity, adipose tissue (AT) undergoes expansion via several processes: expansion of adipocytes and insufficient vascularization lead to hypoxia; adipocyte apoptosis/necrosis; irregular fatty acid flux; and enhanced secretion of inflammatory adipokines, cytokines, and chemokines. In individuals with obesity the liver can also become a target of COVID-19 infection, although major liver damage is uncommon. COVID-19 acute pandemic often develops in patients with major metabolic abnormalities, including fatty liver disease, which is part of a chronic pandemic together with body fat accumulation. During metabolic abnormalities, the expansion of metabolically active fat parallels chronic inflammatory changes, the development of Insulin Resistance (IR), and in the liver, the accumulation of fat, possibly, an underlying fibrosis. SARS-Cov-2 virus might affect the liver by direct or indirect mechanisms. The current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic diseases has extensively contributed to increase the number of severe cases and deaths from COVID-19, resulting in a health, political and economic crisis with long-lasting consequences.

Our hemodialysis unit experienced a COVID-19 outbreak despite following symptom-based screening guidelines. We describe the course of the COVID-19 outbreak and the infection control measures taken for mitigation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 237 maintenance hemodialysis patients and 93 hemodialysis staff at a single hemodialysis center in Toronto, Canada. EXPOSURE: Universal screening of patients and staff for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from patients and staff using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive statistics were used for clinical characteristics and the primary outcome. RESULTS: 11 of 237 (4.6%) hemodialysis patients and 11 of 93 (12%) staff members had a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2. Among individuals testing positive, 12 of 22 (55%) were asymptomatic at time of testing and 7 of 22 (32%) were asymptomatic for the duration of follow-up. One patient was hospitalized at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 additional patients with positive test results were subsequently hospitalized. 2 (18%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit. After 30 days' follow-up, no patients had died or required mechanical ventilation. No hemodialysis staff required hospitalization. Universal droplet and contact precautions were implemented during the outbreak. Hemodialysis staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection were placed on home quarantine regardless of symptom status. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic individuals, were treated with droplet and contact precautions until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results.

The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.","output":"Responses of Human Endothelial Cells to Pathogenic and Non-Pathogenic Leptospira Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term Postponed Fractures (PF) appears to be more logical when one talks about neglected fractures.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to characterize the lung histopathologic features of COVID-19 and compare them against findings of other recent viral pandemics, H1N1 influenza and SARS. We systematically searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies published up to June 24, 2020, using search terms for COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS with keywords for pathology, biopsy, and autopsy. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, our systematic review analysis included 26 articles representing 171 COVID-19 patients; 20 articles representing 287 H1N1 patients; and eight articles representing 64 SARS patients. RESULTS: In COVID-19, acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was reported in 88% of patients, which was similar to the proportion of cases with DAD in both H1N1 (90%) and SARS (98%). Pulmonary microthrombi were reported in 57% of COVID-19 and 58% of SARS patients, as compared with 24% of H1N1 influenza patients. INTERPRETATION: DAD, the histologic correlate of ARDS, is the predominant histopathologic pattern identified in lung pathology from patients with COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS.

Intestinal microbial disorders induce enteric inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, thereby causing adverse effects on the growth and health of pigs. In the human medicine, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which engrafts the fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into a patient recipient, has shown efficacy in intestinal microbiota restoration. In addition, it has been used widely in therapy for human gastrointestinal diseases, including Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome. Given that pigs share many similarities with humans, in terms of anatomy, nutritional physiology, and intestinal microbial compositions, FMT may also be used to restore the normal intestinal microbiota of pigs. However, feasible procedures for performing FMT in pigs remains unclear. Here, we summarize a standardized preparation for FMT in pigs by combining the standard methodology for human FMT with pig production. The key issues include the donor selection, fecal material preparation, fecal material transfer, stool bank establishment, and the safety for porcine FMT. Optimal donors should be selected to ensure the efficacy of porcine FMT and reduce the risks of transmitting infectious diseases to recipients during FMT. Preparing for fresh fecal material is highly recommended. Alternatively, frozen fecal suspension can also be prepared as an optimal choice because it is convenient and has similar efficacy. Oral administration of fecal suspension could be an optimal method for porcine fecal material transfer. Furthermore, the dilution ratio of fecal materials and the frequency of fecal material transfer could be adjusted according to practical situations in the pig industry. To meet the potential large-scale requirement in the pig industry, it is important to establish a stool bank to make porcine FMT readily available. Future studies should also focus on providing more robust safety data on FMT to improve the safety and tolerability of the recipient pigs.

The abilities of platelets and keratinocytes may be harnessed in order to stimulate wound healing through the formation of platelet clots, the release of several growth factors and cytokines, and cell proliferation. The aim of the study was to test whether autologous keratinocyte suspensions in platelet concentrate would improve wound healing. The study was conducted at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland in 45 patients, randomized to three different topical treatment groups: standard treatment serving as control, autologous platelet concentrate (PC) and keratinocytes suspended in autologous platelet concentrate (PC + K). Split thickness skin graft donor sites were chosen on the anterolateral thighs of patients undergoing plastic surgery for a variety of defects. Wound healing was assessed by the duration and quality of the healing process. Pain intensity was evaluated at day five. RESULTS Healing time was reduced from 13.9  0.5 days (mean  SEM) in the control group to 7.2  0.2 days in the PC group (P < 0.01). An addition of keratinocytes in suspension further reduced the healing time to 5.7  0.2 days. Pain was reduced in both the PC and PC + K groups. Data showed a statistically detectable advantage of using PC + K over PC alone (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The results demonstrate the positive contribution of autologous platelets combined with keratinocytes in stimulating wound healing and reducing pain.

In this study, we characterized and quantified the zot-encoding filamentous phage VAI?, spontaneously induced from the fish pathogen V. anguillarum. VAI? contained 6117 bp encoding 11 ORFs, including ORF8pVAI, exhibiting 27%-73% amino acid identity to Inovirus Zot-like proteins. A qPCR method revealed an average of four VAI? genomes per host genome during host exponential growth phase, and PCR demonstrated dissemination of induced VAI? to other V. anguillarum strains through re-integration in non-lysogens. VAI? integrated into both chromosomes of V. anguillarum by recombination, causing changes in a putative ORF in the phage genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the V. anguillarum Inoviridae elements revealed mosaic genome structures related to mainly V. cholerae. Altogether, this study contributes to the understanding of Inovirus infection dynamics and mobilization of zot-like genes beyond human pathogenic vibrios, and discusses their potential role in the evolution of the fish pathogen V. anguillarum.","output":"Beyond Cholera: Characterization of zot-Encoding Filamentous Phages in the Marine Fish Pathogen Vibrio anguillarum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our paper is an investigation by the board of the Younger Academics Network of Insolvency Law (YANIL) into the insolvency law responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in six European legal systems (Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom).

Objective: To summarize the existing literature on Covid-19 pneumonia imaging including precautionary measures for radiology departments, Chest CT's role in diagnosis and ematic literature search of PubMed/med line electronic databases. Results: The radiologymanagement, imaging findings of COVID-19 patients including children and pregnant women, artificial intelligence applications and practical recommendations. Methods: A syst departments' staff is on the front line of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Strict adherence to precautionary measures is the main defense against infection's spread. Although nucleic acid testing is Covid-19's pneumonia diagnosis gold standard; kits shortage and low sensitivity led to the implementation of the highly sensitive chest computed tomography amidst initial diagnostic tools. Initial Covid-19a?Ca?T features comprise bilateral, peripheral or posterior, multilobar ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes. Consolidations superimposed on ground-glass opacifications are found in few cases, preponderantly in the elderly. In later disease stages, GGO transformation into multifocal consolidations, thickened interlobular and intralobular lines, crazy paving, traction bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural bands are reported. Standardized CT reporting is recommended to guide radiologists. While lung ultrasound, pulmonary MRI, and PET CT are not Covid-19 pneumonia's first-line investigative diagnostic modalities, their characteristic findings and clinical value are outlined.

In this study, we investigate the inhibiting potentialities of triazole-based compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is known to play a prominent role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. Compounds were pre-screened from 171 candidates (collected from the DrugBank database). The results showed that four candidates (Bemcentinib, Bisoctrizole, PYIITM and NIPFC) had high binding affinity values and had the potential to interrupt the main protease (Mpro) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pharmacokinetic parameters of these candidates were assessed and they were then put through molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for stability, interaction and conformation analysis.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious health problem to human beings. The evidence suggests that inflammatory markers related to liver damage increase in severe forms of COVID-19 compared to mild cases. METHODS: The electronic databases ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched for articles published up to May, 2020. Data from each identified study was combined using the random effects model to estimate standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity and publication bias were also calculated. RESULTS: Totally, 23 studies were included in this meta-analysis comprising 4313 patients with COVID-19. The random effects results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of CRP [SMD = 3.26 mg/L; (95% CI 2.5, 3.9); p<0.05; I2 = 98.02%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], TNF [SMD = 1.78 ng/mL; (95% CI 0.39, 3.1); p=0.012; I2 = 98.2%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], and IL-6 [ SMD = 3.67 ng/mL; (95% CI 2.4, 4.8); p<0.05; I2 = 97.8%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00] compared with those with the mild form of the disease. Significant heterogeneity was present. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar effect size while reducing the heterogeneity.

Optimal cutoff points of response entropy and state entropy for use in predicting responses to tail clamping were analyzed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Sevoflurane MAC ranged from 1.8% to 2.6% (mean  SD, 2.2  0.3%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Population-based observational study using data from the National Registry for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox) and from a survey to all centres prescribing LTOT in Sweden. Swedevox data provided information on incidence of LTOT and characteristics of patients starting LTOT during 2015C2020. RESULTS: Between March-Dec 2020, 131 patients started LTOT due to covid-19, corresponding to 20.5% of incident LTOT in Sweden. Compared with 2015C19, the total number of patients starting LTOT did not increase. No significant differences in patient characteristics or underlying causes of hypoxemia were found between patients starting LTOT during 2020 compared 2015C2019. The majority of the LTOT centres estimated that, since the start of the pandemic, the incidence of LTOT was unchanged and the time devoted for LTOT work was the same or slightly less.

Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. RESULTS: The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p < 0.001).

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafs, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Caf debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Caf for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

These movements contribute to the prevalence and development of low back pain (LBP). In previous studies, it has been shown that modifying their posture by education and training in proper lifting techniques decreases the prevalence of LBP. However, this education and training needs to be implemented daily. Hence, implementing the use of a wearable device to monitor the back posture with haptic feedback would be of importance to prevent LBP. This paper proposes a wearable device to monitor the back posture of the user and provide feedback when the participant is performing a possible hurtful movement. In this study, a group of participants was asked to wear the device while performing three of the most common activities performed by nurses. The study was divided into three sessions: In the first session, the participants performed the activities without feedback (baseline). During the second session, the participants received feedback from the wearable device (training) while performing the three tasks. Finally, for the third session, the participants performed the three tasks again, but the haptic feedback was turned off (validation). We found an improvement in the posture of more than 40% for the pitch (lateral bending) and roll (forward/backward bending) axes and 7% for the yaw (twisting) axis when comparing to the results from session 1 and session 2. The comparison between session 1 and session 3 showed an overall improvement of more than 50% for the pitch (lateral bending) and roll (forward/backward bending) axes and more than 20% for the yaw axis.

METHODS Review of clinical and pathological records, period April 2002 to April 2014, in patients under 13 years of age. RESULTS 19/22 patients met the inclusion requirement, 12 had co-morbidity: 26% with a history of recent surgery and 21% were neonates. Etiology was documented in blood cultures in 26% and by tissue culture in 63% (one third of them polymicrobial). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the three most common etiologic agents. Case fatality rate was 42%, one of the highest in our region. CONCLUSION NF is a serious, unusual pathology, frequently associated with neonatology and post-surgical patients, with a mixed etiology that requires the association of antimicrobials and early surgery. Its lethality is high in our setting, over previously published series.","output":"[Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and microbiology of children with necrotizing fasciitis in a Costa Rican pediatric hospital]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital platform companies whose business models hinge on the monetization of personal information, notably through targeted advertising, have run roughshod over competitors, communities, and democracy itself in the single-minded pursuit of market dominance and ever-increasing profits.

In order to provide dental services teledentistry was employed. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to review the literature and information available on the provision and utilization of teledentistry as a method to address oral health needs of paediatric patients. RESULTS: Teledentistry has been utilised in paediatric population for the purpose of oral health education and promotion, remote diagnosis and monitoring, and behaviour guidance. Studies involving paediatric population for aforementioned applications have shown that this practice strategy is beneficial to provide dental treatment in remote locations with little access to paediatric dental specialists, monitor patients between appointments, conduct remote diagnosis and screening programmes, promote oral health of children through dental education, and in pre-appointment behaviour guidance. This method was particularly useful during the current COVID-19 pandemic where dentists use their mobile phones, computer webcams for patient appointments while maintaining safe distance and avoid exposing themselves as well as patient to the virus. CONCLUSION: Teledentistry can be a supplement to face-to-face methods of paediatric dental care, ultimately leading to better patient management. This technology can make a significant contribution in reducing the supply-demand gap of paediatric dental specialists in places where healthcare facilities are limited and ensure safety during the pandemic whilst providing dental care to paediatric patients. Further research is required for safe, effective and evidence-based use of teledentistry in the field of paediatric dentistry.","output":"Teledentistry and its applications in paediatric dentistry: A literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing has been grounded in the pursuit of health equity and social justice for over 100 years.

Similar clots form in the Rivalta's test, a method with high diagnostic accuracy for FIP. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy for FIP and the optimal cutoff of TNC. METHODS: After a retrospective search of our database, DIFF and BASO counts, and the TNC from cats with and without FIP were compared to each other. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR?) were calculated. A ROC curve was designed to determine the cutoff for best sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Effusions from 20 FIP and 31 non\\\\FIP cats were analyzed. The TNC was higher (P < .001), and BASO and DIFF counts were lower (P < .001 and P < .05) in FIP than in non\\\\FIP cats. Only 2 FIP cats with atypical effusions had a TNC < 3.0.

CONCLUSIONS: The TNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP\\\\related effusions by providing an estimate of precipitable proteins, as the Rivalta's test, in addition to the cell count. As fibrin clots result in false lower BASO counts, the TNC is preferable to the WBC count generated by the BASO channel alone in suspected FIP effusions.","output":"High diagnostic accuracy of the Sysmex XT\\\\2000iV delta total nucleated cells on effusions for feline infectious peritonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, cases of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were first reported in Wuhan, China.

In patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection, the pulmonary vein (PV) was isolated and stapled following thoracotomy. The number of CTCs retained per 7.5 ml PV blood (CTC-PV) and peripheral blood were detected. Following hematopoietic cell depletion, a xenograft assay was performed using the CTC-PV. A total of 32 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, the majority of whom had CTCs in their PV blood (n=29, 90.6%). Circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) were identified in 12 patients (37.5%). The CTC-PV and CTM-PV counts were positively correlated with tumor size (P=0.012 and P=0.028, respectively). Patients with small tumors (<3.0 cm) also had considerable CTC-PV and CTM-PV. A total of 8 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy prior to surgery.

We attribute the long survival time of the coronavirus on a surface to the slow evaporation of a thin nanometer liquid film remaining after the evaporation of the bulk droplet. Accordingly, we employ a computational model for a thin film in which the evaporating mass rate is a function of disjoining and Laplace pressures inside the film. The model shows a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the film and suggests that the drying time of this nanometric film is on the order of hours, consistent with the survival time of the coronavirus on a surface, seen in published experiments. We briefly examine the change in the drying time as a function of the contact angle and type of surface.

Next, we argue that the changing asymmetries of health needs in hospitals means that careful consideration needs to be given to a stepwise process for deallocating staff from their usual duties. We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are fit for reallocation have been identified.

If any, these periods should favor RIRP, since globalization is a process where economies and financial markets become increasingly integrated into a global economic system. In contrast to the existing literature, we model the departures from RIRP as a long-term memory process and apply fractional integration methods on a sample of real interest rate differentials of seven developed countries: France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the UK across the three globalization waves paired against the USA. We compute impulse response functions (IRF) to gain further insight into the memory characteristics of the RIRP differential processes and provide half-life estimates. We find that deviations from RIRP are mean reverting, providing robust evidence of real interest rate convergence during the three globalization waves. We shed further light on financial and commodity market integration during the three globalization waves by assessing the memory properties of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and relative purchasing power parity (PPP) differential processes. We find that deviations from relative PPP and UIP are not always mean-reverting processes. RIRP, relative PPP, and UIP hold simultaneously only in 7 out of 21 cases;RIRP and UIP hold in 11 out of 21 cases;RIRP hold without the support of relative PPP and UIP in 3 out of 21 cases.

A central requirement of such schemes is that the box preserves neutrality throughout the calculation. There are many ways to deal with this problem that have been discussed over the years ranging from a neutralizing plasma with a post hoc correction term through to a simple co-alchemical ion within the same box. The post hoc correction approach is the most widespread. However, the vast majority of these studies have been applied to a soluble protein in a homogeneous solvent (water or salt solution). In this work, we explore which of the more common approaches would be the most suitable for a simulation box with a lipid bilayer within it. We further develop the idea of the so-called Rocklin correction for lipid-bilayer systems and show how such a correction could work. However, we also show that it will be difficult to make this generalizable in a practical way and thus we conclude that the use of a co-alchemical ion is the most useful approach for simulations involving lipid membrane systems.","output":"Correction Schemes for Absolute Binding Free Energies Involving Lipid Bilayers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Racial/ethnic disparities in congenital heart disease outcomes are well documented. The impact of COVID-19 on race/ethnicity in access to ambulatory pediatric cardiology care is unknown. Methods: To examine differences in ambulatory care visits by race/ethnicity and whether differences were exacerbated by the COVID pandemic (March 2020), we examined number of visits scheduled (0-18 years old) and visit completion (as scheduled, delayed completion within 6 months, incomplete) by race/ethnicity. We focused on early pandemic, April 2020 (vs April 2019) and later pandemic, July 2020 (vs April 2020), using chi-square and logistic regression. Results: Annual clinic volume fell by 4.5% during the pandemic (18,725 to 17,866). Race/ethnicity shifted slightly towards white compared to non-white minority (NWM) 30% vs 28%, p<0.001. Public insurance was constant at 33%, p=0.83. Telehealth visits accounted for 46% of visits during the pandemic (0.8% pre-pandemic), with different utility by white than NWM patients (49% vs 43%, p<0.001). Visits in April 2020 fell by 57% from April 2019 and percent of visits completed without delay declined from 69% to 39%, p<0.001. Visits in July were similar from 2019 to 2020 but visits completed without delay declined from 71% to 62%, p<0.001. Visit completion rates varied by race/ethnicity (Figure 1), with differences between white vs NWM early in the pandemic (p=0.01). Differences in visit completion rates by race/ethnicity were not significantly different from the year prior (p for interaction=0.74) or from April to July 2020 (p for interaction=0.48). Conclusions: NWM have higher rates of incomplete/delayed visits compared to whites, though the difference was not statistically heightened by the pandemic. Telehealth visits have become a prominent part of ambulatory care, with higher completion rates by white patients. Efforts to reduce lapses in care are needed across demographics to ensure equitable care delivery.","output":"Impact of the covid-19 pandemic on ambulatory pediatric cardiology care by race/ethnicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Defense mechanisms serve as mediators referred to the subjects attempt to manage stressors capable of threatening their integrity. Mature defense mechanisms represent the high adaptive group, including suppression, which allows the subject to distance disturbing contents from consciousness. In line with general defensive intents, suppression would preserve stable mood states, as in the case of euthymia. Clinical issues usually disturb homeorhesis, so that the study of subjects suppressive tendencies would suggest possible existing relations among defense mechanisms, mood states, and clinical issues. The study highlighted the significant existing relations among factors such as suppression, euthymia, mood states, and clinical psychological phenomena. Methods: The observation group was composed of 150 participants, 51 males (34%) and 99 females (66%), aged from 25 to 30 years old, with a mean age of 26.63 years old (SD = 1.51). The study was conducted through the use of measures related to subjects characteristics, euthymia, psychological flexibility and psychological well-being (Euthymia Scale), suppression (Suppression Mental Questionnaire), well-being (Who-5), and compassion (ProQol-5). Results: The performed analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, correlations, differences, and regressions among the considered variables. Starting from the first hypothesis, SMQ factors appeared to be significantly and positively correlated with Euthymia factors, rather than Regression in the Ego service (-). In line with the previous result, significant and positive correlations emerged among SMQ and Well-being (WHO-5) variables, maintaining an inverse relation with Regression in the Ego service. Significant differences emerged between male and female groups concerning SMQ total score and rationalization, with higher male group scores. Finally, significant dependencies emerged among the selected predictors (SMQ variables) and Compassion satisfaction. Conclusion: The emerged results highlighted significant relations among the considered variables so that it was possible to highlight the common directions assumed by suppression variables, well-being, and euthymia. Moreover, suppression appeared as a significant predictor with a causal role in clinical satisfaction. The results that have emerged allow us to consider defenses through an empirical perspective, useful to suggest an extension to other groups, phenomena, and conditions.","output":"The Role of Suppression and the Maintenance of Euthymia in Clinical Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE(S): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an enormous challenge to healthcare systems globally. Optimizing access to healthcare while minimizing face-to-face patient encounters is critical to limiting exposures, conserving resources, and preserving health. We aimed to evaluate the utility of a COVID-focused telehealth program in avoiding potential in-person visits while maintaining high patient satisfaction. METHODS: All patients with COVID-related virtual visits at our center between March and May 2020 were included. Demographic, satisfaction, and clinical information were gathered using a modified, validated telehealth satisfaction questionnaire disseminated via email or telephone. Data were analyzed using Stata. RESULTS: Of 581 eligible patients, 180 (31%) responded to the survey. Symptoms (73%) and possible exposure (22%) were the main reasons cited for pursuing a virtual visit; cough (44%) and fever (36%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Regarding patient satisfaction, most patients rated the experience as very good or excellent, and 94% of respondents said they would recommend COVID-focused triage through telehealth to others. Over 81% of patients indicated that, if telehealth was not an option, they would have sought an in-person encounter. Ultimately, only 27% of patients reported pursuing a face-to-face encounter after participating in the virtual visit. CONCLUSION: Based on patient self-reporting, telemedicine potentially prevented face-to-face COVID-related encounters. Patients expressed satisfaction with the virtual process and were less likely to pursue in-person consultation.

We aim to analyze the effect of chronic treatment with calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers on COVID 19 severity in a Spanish cohort during the 2020 pandemic. METHODS: Observational study including all consecutive patients (40 years old) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 through PCR in the microbiology laboratory of our hospital, from March 2nd to 20th 2020. Clinical characteristics and drugs were recorded. The Primary end-point (PE) was all-cause death and the secondary end-point (SE) was the combined of death or the need for orotracheal intubation until 30 days of infection symptoms onset. RESULTS: We included 704 patients in our study. Baseline characteristics of the overall cohort can be seen in the table. Median age was 61 years old (IQR 52.9C72.9); 52.7% were female. 34.7% and 12.6% had hypertension and diabetes respectively. After a median follow-up of 111.5 days, 58 patients (8.2%) needed orotracheal intubation and 133 patients (18.9%) died. Secondary endpoint (all-cause death or need for orotracheal intubation) was reached by 164 patients (23.3%). The table described clinical differences between survivors and deceased patients. After multivariate Cox modeling, age, male gender, diabetes, previous lung disease, BMI and the chronic intake of calcium channel blockers (HR 1.74, 95% CI (1.11C2.75), p=0.016) and beta-blockers (HR 1.71, 95% CI (1.07C2.76), p=0.026) were independently related with mortality. Other cardiovascular drugs (Antiplatelets, anticoagulants, diuretics, mineralcorticoid-receptor antagonists, angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins) did not influence survival after SARS-CoV 2 infection (Figure). The secondary outcome was reached by 164 patients (23.3%) and chronic treatment with calcium channel blockers remains as an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.55, 95% CI (1.01C2.37), p=0.044).

METHODS: Online-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 1190 questionnaires were (partly) answered. With respect to outpatient care and consultations from 15 March to 15 April 2020, a total of 69 (5.8%) participants indicated unlimited, 756 (63.5%) reduced and 330 (27.7%) emergency care only, independent of the type of institution. Outpatient surgery was restricted to emergency surgery in 68% of clinics, 42.0% of inpatient wards, 45.0% of surgical medical care centers and group practices and 33.0% of private practices. Inpatient procedures were limited to emergency care in 75.0% of inpatient wards and in 71.0% of clinics. With the exception of endophthalmitis (+8.2%), the number of urgent indications and emergencies declined: retinal detachment (?34.8%), perforating eyeball injuries (?7.3%), acute glaucoma (?17.8%), central retinal artery occlusion and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (?31.0%), others (?30.9%), penetrating keratoplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation (?59.1%). Institutional or professional policy requirements (76.0%) and appointment cancellation by patients (84.0%) were the most common reasons for limitations in ophthalmic patient care. CONCLUSION: The initial phase of the pandemic was characterized by a massive reduction in non-urgent conservative and surgical treatment that affected all areas of ophthalmology.

The present systematic scoping review aims to identify the extent, range, and nature of articles related to COVID-19 and maintenance HD: it reports specifically the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the HD population, implementation of strategies for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in HD centres, demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes of the pediatric and adult HD patients. METHODS: A multi-step systematic search of the literature in Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, Embase and Web of Science, published between December 1, 2019, and January 30, 2021 was performed. Two authors separately screened the titles and abstracts of the documents and ruled out irrelevant articles. A report of the papers that met inclusion criteria was performed; then, a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included articles and a narrative synthesis of the results were performed. RESULTS: The review process ended with the inclusion of 145 articles. Most of them were based on single-centre experiences, which spontaneously developed best practices. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries (69.7%) and a part of them (9.6%) were not in English. Prevalence of COVID-19 among dialysis patients accounted for 0%-37.6%. Preventive measures were reported in 54% of the included articles, with particular emphasis on education, triage, hygiene, and containment measures. Patients experienced a heterogeneous spectrum of symptoms that led 35%-88.2% of them to hospital admission. Median and mean hospital length of stay ranged from 8 to 28.5 and 16.2 to 22 days, respectively. Admission to intensive care units varied widely across studies (from 2.6% to 70.5%) and was associated with high mortality (42.8%C100%). Overall, prognosis was poor in 0%C47% of the hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic scoping review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on the frail world of HD patients. Furthermore, it may help to implement the existing strategies of COVID-19 prevention and provide a list of unmet needs (safe transport, testing, shelter). Finally, it may be a stimulus for performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses which will form the basis for evidence-based guidelines.

While audio-based classification consistently offers better performance than acceleration-based classification, we observe that the difference is very small for the best systems. Since the acceleration signal requires less processing power, and since the need to record audio is sidestepped and thus privacy is inherently secured, and since the recording device is attached to the bed and not worn, an accelerometer-based highly accurate non-invasive cough detector may represent a more convenient and readily accepted method in long-term cough monitoring.","output":"Automatic Non-Invasive Cough Detection based on Accelerometer and Audio Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the loss of more than 500 mL of blood following childbirth, is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.

We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. RESULTS: 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010-2019.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated right ventricular pressures and the ePAD measured in 30 invasively ventilated COVID\\\\19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients between 1 October 2020 and 31 March 2021. We divided the patients into two groups, survivors and non\\\\survivors based on their 60 day mortality. Primary outcome variables were the values of right ventricular pressures and the ePAD over time after insertion of the right ventricular probe. Right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP, (IQR; 25th to 75th percentile)] was significantly lower on the first and the last measurement day in the survivors compared with the non\\\\survivors [Day 1: 38 (27C45) vs. 46 (44C49), P = 0.036; last day: 36 (27C44) vs. 51 (40C57) mmHg, P = 0.006]. 16/22 survivors and 7/8 non\\\\survivors received sildenafil orally, one survivor received additionally inhaled nitric oxide and one survivor and one non\\\\survivor each inhaled iloprost.

In theory, a countrys index value could increase, even though its GDP might fall, because of significant increased unemployment in low-productivity sectors such as tourism and retail. It follows that the index value could fall when these sectors recover. Also, high-performing countries could see their index value fall because of the pandemics impact in high-value sectors, such as demand for oil.Consequently, a wider perspective of productivity is necessary. This paper, therefore, proposes a complementary index which adjusts labour productivity for levels of unemploymentthe social labour productivity index (SLPI)and recommends that the labour productivity index itself should be standardised. The relationship between employment and productivity is complex. For example, the UKs economic performance, involving comparatively low labour productivity and low unemployment, has been deemed a productivity puzzle. A literature review discusses this relationship, but it is clear that econometric worldwide evaluation requires very large data sets, that are unlikely to be routinely available in practice to monitor international performance. By contrast, data sets on national productivity are small and already available, although they contain little or no data on causal factors. SLPI values were calculated for differing levels of unemployment and relative labour productivity for newly employed workers for countries where data was available; with patterns over the period 1986C2016 established for the G7 countries, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain.

Currently, many research groups have slowed down their respective projects to concentrate efforts in the study of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. In this bibliometric analysis and mini-review, we aimed to describe how computational methods or omics approaches were used during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed bibliometric data from Scopus, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv (dated June 19(th), 2020) using quantitative and knowledge mapping approaches. We complemented our analysis with a manual process of carefully reading the selected articles to identify either the omics or bioinformatic tools used and their purpose. RESULTS: From a total of 184 articles, we found that metagenomics and transcriptomics were the main sources of data to perform phylogenetic analysis aimed at corroborating zoonotic transmission, identifying the animal origin and taxonomic allocation of SARS-CoV-2. Protein sequence analysis, immunoinformatics and molecular docking were used to give insights about SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug and vaccine development. Most of the publications were from China and USA. However, China, Italy and India covered the top 10 most cited papers on this topic. CONCLUSION: We found an abundance of publications using omics and bioinformatics approaches to establish the taxonomy and animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.

However, factors driving heterogeneous B cell subset accumulation and antibody (Ab) production in the CNS compartment, including the contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF), during chronic CNS inflammation remain unclear and is a major gap in our understanding of neuroinflammation. We sought to address this gap using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) model of progressive MS. In this model, injection of the virus into susceptible mouse strains results in a persistent infection associated with demyelination and progressive disability. During chronic infection, the predominant B cell phenotypes accumulating in the CNS were isotype-switched B cells, including Bmem and ASC with na?ve/early activated and transitional B cells present at low frequencies. B cell accumulation in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD coincided with intrathecal Ab synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mature and isotype-switched B cells predominately localized to the meninges and perivascular space, with IgG isotype-switched B cells frequently accumulating in the parenchymal space. Both mature and isotype-switched B cells and T cells occupied meningeal and perivascular spaces, with minimal evidence for spatial organization typical of ELF mimicking secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). Moreover, immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates revealed a lack of SLO-like ELF features, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and germinal center B cell markers. Nonetheless, flow cytometric assessment of B cells within the CNS showed enhanced expression of activation markers, including moderate upregulation of GL7 and expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80. B cell-related chemokines and trophic factors, including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL19, and CXCL13, were elevated in the CNS. These results indicate that localization of heterogeneous B cell populations, including activated and isotype-switched B cell phenotypes, to the CNS and intrathecal Ab (ItAb) synthesis can occur independently of SLO-like follicles during chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.","output":"Central Nervous System Inflammatory Aggregates in the Theiler's Virus Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Food Things Network(+) (IoFT) and the Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence for Automated Investigation for Scientific Discovery Network(+) (AI3SD) brought together an interdisciplinary multi-institution working group to create an ethical framework for digital collaboration in the food industry.

The illusion consists in a compelling and immediate experience that the space behind an occluding object in the foreground is empty. Although the illusion refers to a region of space, which is invisible due to occlusion (a blind spot), there is evidence to suggest that it is nevertheless driven by visual mechanisms and that it can be just as deceptive and powerful as ordinary visual illusions. We suggest that this novel illusion can make situations involving blind spots in a road user's field of view even more dangerous than one would expect based on the lack of visibility by itself. This could be because it erroneously makes the road user feel that (s)he has actually seen everything there is to see, and thus has verified that the blind spot is empty. This hypothesis requires further testing before definitive conclusions can be drawn, but we wish to make researchers and authorities involved in the analysis of traffic accidents and on-the-spot crash investigations aware of its potential role in order to encourage registration of relevant data and facilitate further research.","output":"The illusion of absence: how a common feature of magic shows can explain a class of road accidents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have emphasised the effects of perceived social approval in employees professional environment (colleagues and managers) on the implementation of remote and mediatised work practices and, more specifically, on their spatial, temporal and material characteristics.

METHODS: We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed up to November 2019. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were mortality, clinical cure, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1239 patients and eight retrospective cohort or case-control studies (CSs) with a total 6125 patients were identified. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were significantly increased in patients treated with LZD in RCTs (clinical cure: risk ratio (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.71-0.92; microbiological eradication: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.81) and CSs (clinical cure: odds ratio (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69).

Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS COV2, resulting in significant delays in treatment provision and commencement of outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test as compared to the gold standard test for diagnosis of SARS COV2 in Kenya. Methods: This was a field test performance evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults undergoing testing for SARS COV2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV2-positive based on the locally implemented gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. 272 antigen tests were performed with simultaneous gold standard testing, allowing us to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the BD Veritor rapid antigen test platform. Implementation characteristics were assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for feasibility, acceptability, turn-around time, and ease-of-use metrics. Results and Discussion: We enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to the gold standard, the sensitivity of the BD Veritor antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100). The sensitivity of BD Veritor antigen test was higher among symptomatic (100%) compared to asymptomatic (84%) participants, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was also a lack of association between cycle threshold value and sensitivity of BD Veritor test. The BD Veritor test had quick turnaround time and minimal resource requirements, and laboratory personnel conducting testing felt that it was easier to use than the gold standard RT-PCR. Conclusion: The BD Veritor rapid antigen test exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in varied population settings in Kenya.

Early evidence suggests that the microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n=58) and lower (n=35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients identified increased oral microbiota compared to controls. These oral microbiota were found physically associated with proinflammatory immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Mechanical ventilation affects respiratory microbiome of COVID-19 patients and its interactions with the host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consider a microphone array, such as those present in Amazon Echos, conference phones, or self-driving cars. One of the goals of these arrays is to decode the angles in which acoustic signals arrive at them. This paper considers the problem of estimating K angle of arrivals (AoA), i.e., the direct path's AoA and the AoA of subsequent echoes. Significant progress has been made on this problem, however, solutions remain elusive when the source signal is unknown (such as human voice) and the channel is strongly correlated (such as in multipath settings). Today's algorithms reliably estimate the direct-path-AoA, but the subsequent AoAs diverge in noisy real-world conditions. We design SubAoA, an algorithm that improves on the current body of work. Our core idea models signal in a new AoA sub-space, and employs a cancellation approach that successively cancels each AoA to decode the next. We explain the behavior and complexity of the algorithm from the first principles, simulate the performance across a range of parameters, and present results from real-world experiments. Comparison against multiple existing algorithms like GCC-PHAT, MUSIC, and VoLoc shows increasing gains for the latter AoAs, while our computation complexity allows real-time operation.

However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date. METHODS: We used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: Data for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study. Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died. The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 374% (95% CI 344-404). Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge. The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 189, 95% CI 120-297). In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 380% (95% CI 346-415). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%.

It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia healthcare workers and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHODS: We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian healthcare worker infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25(th) and July 8(th), 2020. A line list of healthcare worker related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for healthcare workers were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to healthcare worker cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst healthcare workers, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULTS: We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or outbreaks between January 25(th) and July 8(th), 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 healthcare workers in Australia have been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of healthcare worker infection was 72/100,000 and of community infection 34/100,000. healthcare workers were 2.76 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.53 to 3.01; P<0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 healthcare workers across 21 outbreaks, led to 1656 healthcare workers being furloughed for quarantine. One hospital was closed and had 1200 workers quarantined in one outbreak. CONCLUSION: The study shows that HCWs were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, healthcare workers are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous workers during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low, highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faces a resurgence of COVID-19 since late June 2020, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of healthcare worker infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for healthcare workers.","output":"Estimating the Burden of COVID-19 on the Australian Healthcare Workers and Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 worldwide emergence and evolution has resulted in variants containing mutations resulting in immune evasive epitopes that decrease vaccine efficacy.

In order to address this issue, two laboratories proficient in measuring oocyst infectivity conducted independent dose titration studies with neonatal CD-1 mice using standardized protocols and a well-characterized isolate of Cryptosporidium parvum. The resulting independent logistic dose-response models derived by regression analysis were compared with each other and with a published model. The comparisons showed these dose-response functions to be reproducible under standardized conditions. It is important to standardize mouse strain, age of mice at inoculation and necropsy, oocyst isolate, and age of oocysts. However, other factors, including methods used to detect infectivity and to count oocyst doses, appear less critical.

Utilization of the electronic patient portal for appointment cancellation as a surrogate for telehealth uptake was noted. RESULTS: During the study period, 5340 mammogram appointments were kept and 2784 mammogram appointments were canceled. From a baseline of 30 (10.8%) canceled mammograms in January, cancellations peaked in March (576, 20.6%) and gradually decreased to a low in August (197, 7%). Reasons for cancellations varied significantly by month (P < .0001) and included COVID-19 related (236, 8.5%), unspecified patient reasons (1,210, 43.5%), administrative issues (147, 5.3%), provider requests (46, 1.7%), sooner appointments available (31, 1.1%), and reasons not given (486, 17.5%).

We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option.

The practice of empiric antimicrobial prescription, due to limited diagnostic capabilities of many hospitals, has the potential to escalate an already worrisome antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation in India. This study reports the prevalence and profiles of secondary infections (SIs) and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of secondary infections in patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs) and wards of ten hospitals of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) AMR surveillance network, between June and August 2020, was undertaken. The demographic data, time of infection after admission, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance data of secondary infections, and clinical outcome data of the admitted COVID-19 patients were collated. RESULTS: Out of 17,534 admitted patients, 3.6% of patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The mortality among patients who developed secondary infections was 56.7% against an overall mortality of 10.6% in total admitted COVID-19 patients. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 78% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21%). Thirty-five percent of patients reported polymicrobial infections, including fungal infections. High levels of carbapenem resistance was seen in A. baumannii (92.6%) followed by K. pneumoniae (72.8%). CONCLUSION: Predominance of Gram-negative pathogens in COVID-19 patients coupled with high rates of resistance to higher generation antimicrobials is an alarming finding.

As the sole use of metyrapone in the management of CD has been rarely reported, we describe our experience of using it to treat a pregnant patient with CD. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old woman with hypertension was diagnosed with adrenocorticotropic hormoneCdependent CD on the basis of a urinary free cortisol (UFC) level of 290 g/24 h (reference range, 6-42 g/dL) and an abnormal dexamethasone suppression test (cortisol level, 12.4 g/dL) before becoming pregnant. She conceived naturally 12 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery and was subsequently found to have persistent disease with a UFC level of 768 g/dL. Surgery was deemed high-risk given the proximity of the tumor to the right carotid artery and the high likelihood of residual disease. Instead, she was managed with metyrapone throughout her pregnancy and titrated to a goal UFC level of <150 g/24 h due to the known physiologic increase in the cortisol level during gestation. The patient had diet-controlled gestational diabetes and well-controlled hypertension. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy at 37 weeks of gestation, without adrenal insufficiency in the baby or her. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the successful use of metyrapone throughout pregnancy to manage CD in patients in whom surgery is considered high-risk or in those with a low likelihood of cure. Although metyrapone is effective, close surveillance is required for worsening hypertension, hypokalemia, and potential adrenal insufficiency.

Methods In this retrospective study, we first compared the number of patients who were diagnosed with DR or DME in our clinic during the period of the lockdown and during the same period of the previous year. In addition, we included consecutive patients with DR or DME, who were followed up and treated regularly in our clinic and their appointments deferred due to lockdown, so as to compare the visual acuity, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings prior to and post lockdown. Results During the lockdown period, there was a statistically significant decrease in patients with DR and DME as compared to the same period in the previous year. Regarding patients with previously diagnosed DME, there was a statistically significant worsening in their visual acuity and central retinal thickness after lockdown as compared to the last visit before lockdown (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Concerning patients diagnosed with DR and without DME before lockdown, 30% of patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NDPR) and 8.3% of patients with quiescent proliferative DR (PDR) progressed to active PDR while four out of 107 patients (3.7%) developed DME during the lockdown.

Previous health economic analysis found MRgFUS thalamotomy to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with essential tremor, supporting its reimbursement. With the publication of level I evidence in support of MRgFUS thalamotomy for patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD), the authors performed a health economic comparison between MRgFUS, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and medical therapy. METHODS The authors used a decision tree model with rollback analysis and one-factor sensitivity analysis. Literature searches of MRgFUS thalamotomy and unilateral DBS of the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus for TDPD were performed to determine the utility and probabilities for the model. Costs in Canadian dollars (CAD) were derived from the Schedule of Benefits and Fees in Ontario, Canada, and expert opinion on usage. RESULTS MRgFUS was associated with an expected cost of $14,831 CAD. Adding MRgFUS to continued medical therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,078 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which remained cost-effective under various scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. Comparing DBS to MRgFUS, while DBS did not achieve the willingness-to-pay threshold ($56,503 per QALY) in the base case scenario, it did so under several scenarios in the sensitivity analysis.

Since no specific vaccines or drugs have been developed till date for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, early diagnosis is essential to further combat this pandemic. In this context, the reliable, rapid, and low-cost technique for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is currently the foremost priority. At present reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference technique presently being used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in a number of cases, false results have been noticed in COVID-19 diagnosis. To develop advanced techniques, researchers are continuously working and in the series of constant efforts, nanomaterials-enabled biosensing approaches can be a hope to offer novel techniques that may perhaps meet the current demand of fast and early diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. This paper provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic and nanomaterials enabled biosensing approaches that have been recently reported for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Though limited studies on the development of nanomaterials enabled biosensing techniques for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, this review summarizes nanomaterials mediated improved biosensing strategies and the possible mechanisms that may be responsible for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease. It is reviewed that nanomaterials e.g. gold nanostructures, lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (NPs), graphene and iron oxide NPs can be potentially used to develop advanced techniques offered by colorimetric, amperometric, impedimetric, fluorescence, and optomagnetic based biosensing of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, critical issues that are likely to accelerate the development of nanomaterials enabled biosensing for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been discussed in detail. This review may serve a guide for the development of advanced techniques for nanomaterials enabled biosensing to fulfill the present demand of low-cost, rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Prospects of Nanomaterials-enabled biosensors for COVID-19 detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play pivotal and critical roles in innate and adaptive immune responses; thus, precise and stringent regulation of the stability and activation of IRFs in physiological processes is necessary.

However, few reviews have summarized how host E3 ligases/DUBs or viral proteins regulate IRF stability and activity. Additionally, with recent technological developments, details about the ubiquitination of IRFs have been continuously revealed. As knowledge of how these proteins function and interact with IRFs may facilitate a better understanding of the regulation of IRFs in immune responses or other biological processes, we summarized current studies on the direct ubiquitination of IRFs, with an emphasis on how these proteins interact with IRFs and affect their activities, which may provide exciting targets for drug development by regulating the functions of specific E3 ligases.","output":"Ubiquitination modification: critical regulation of IRF family stability and activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes community action research on the health problems of the santri family due to the impact of COVID-19 in the mosque environment at the neighborhood level of Malang residents.

Historically, they were reversed between 3 and 6 months after initial resection. Recently, earlier closure (< 14 days) has been suggested by some current randomised controlled trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of early stoma closure on surgical and patient outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review of the current randomised controlled trial literature comparing early and standard ileostomy closure after rectal surgery was performed. Specifically, we examined surgical outcomes including; morbidity, mortality and quality of life. RESULTS: Six studies met the predefined criteria and were included in our analysis. 275 patients underwent early stoma closure compared with 259 patients having standard closure. Overall morbidity was similar between both groups (25.5% vs. 21.6%) (OR, 1.47; 95% CI 0.75C2.87). However, there tended to be more reoperations (8.4 vs. 4.2%) (OR, 2.02, 95% CI 0.99C4.14) and small bowel obstructions/postoperative ileus (9.3% vs. 4.4%) (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22C0.90) in the early closure group, but no difference across the other domains. CONCLUSIONS: Early closure appears to be a feasible in highly selective cases after good perioperative counselling and shared decision-making.

The low probability and rare occurrence of such events, however, impose severe sampling and computational requirements on classical solution methods that render them impractical. This work proposes a novel sampling-free method for solving rare chance constrained optimization problems affected by uncertainties that follow general Gaussian mixture distributions. By integrating modern developments in large deviation theory with tools from convex analysis and bilevel optimization, we propose tractable formulations that can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Our formulations enjoy several advantages compared to classical methods: their size and complexity is independent of event rarity, they do not require linearity or convexity assumptions on system constraints, and under easily verifiable conditions, serve as safe conservative approximations or asymptotically exact reformulations of the true problem. Computational experiments on linear, nonlinear and PDE-constrained problems from applications in portfolio management, structural engineering and fluid dynamics illustrate the broad applicability of our method and its advantages over classical sampling-based approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","output":"Optimization under rare chance constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Journal of Health Psychology (EJHP) welcomes all types of empirical studies - regardless whether they cover research questions related to the new Coronavirus and COVID-19 infection or more conventional but nonetheless relevant areas of health psychology Importantly, EJHP also welcomes sound practice-oriented articles and reports of implementation of health psychology interventions into routine health care (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Recurring issues, new questions, promising innovations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Epistaxis was the third most common unscheduled ENT surgical intervention in Ireland in 2019.

A retrospective review of patients records during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Comparative analysis was utilised to assess outcomes. Results Pre Sars-CoV-2 analysis revealed 14 patients (70%) were manged with rigid endoscopy compared to one (5%) interpandemic. Cauterization treated 20 patients (100%) pre pandemic and four patients (20%) interpandemic. Nasal packing modality differed in that 13 patients (65%) were treated with Nasopore pre pandemic and 14 (70%) with Rapid Rhino interpandemic. This exhibited a paradigm shift in that 18 (90%) patients were managed conservatively with nasal packing interpandemic. Conclusion A paradigm shift in the management of Epistaxis during the pandemic has led to treatment which is less invasive, has less morbidity for the patient, requires less hospital admissions and lessens nosocomial transmission of the Sars-CoV-2.

Additionally, the outcomes following infection are far worse than in people without such co-morbities.Factors contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have long been established, yet this disease still bestows a substantial global burden. The aim was to provide a comprehensive review of the burden of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and the additional impact sustained by the diabetes population and healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while providing recommendations of how this burden can be subsided. Methodology: Literature searches were carried out on 'Google Scholar' and 'PubMed' to identify relevant articles for the scope of this review. Information was also collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation and the International Diabetes Federation. Results: T2DM presented with economic, social and health burdens prior to COVID-19 with an significant 'Disability Adjusted Life Years' impact. Whilst people with diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19, enforcing lockdown regulations set by the Public Health department to reduce risk of infection brought about its own challenges to T2DM management. Through recommendations and adapting to new methods of management such as telehealth, these challenges and potential consequences of mismanagement are kept to a minimum whilst safeguarding the healthcare system.

We tested patients who presented symptoms or had contact with a confirmed case. We enrolled 15 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We tested 37 of 306 dialysis patients. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were older (mean age 75.96  11.09 years) and all had comorbidities. At presentation, most had interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray, three-quarters had leucopenia and none had respiratory insufficiency. During follow-up, there was an increase in serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Eighty percent of patients received supplemental oxygen; none received non-invasive ventilation, one was intubated. Most patients (80%) were treated with oral hydroxychloroquine for a median time of 6.5 days [interquartile range (IQR) 5C14.5] and 40% received azithromycin; two patients received a short course of antivirals and one received a single dose of tocilizumab.

METHODS Through a systematic literature search up to December 2020, 20 studies were found recording relationships between the effects of different types of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines compared to each other on the frequency of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations in children aged less than 2 years. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated between different types of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines compared to each other on the frequency of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations in children aged less than 2 years using the dichotomous methods with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10 was significantly related to a lower hospitalization rate for pneumonia (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81, p<0.001) compared to no vaccine and (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90, p<0.001) compared to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7.

Further studies are needed to solidify the findings to other vaccines to have evidence-based information that could help in establishing future immunization strategies.","output":"Pneumococcal vaccine effect on hospitalization rates of pneumonia in children: A meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries face an increasingly complex vaccination landscape.

Eligibility criteria included ASA fitness grade I-III, BMI below 25 kg/m2 and TNM stage T3 N0 M0. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or distant metastasis. The anastomosis was either handsewn or performed mechanically. Results Sixteen patients were operated on by a transanal and four by a transvaginal approach. There were ten men and ten women, with a mean(s.d.) age of 556(121) years. Mean BMI was 224(26) kg/m2. Four anterior, 11 low anterior and five intersphincteric resections were performed for 16 rectal and four low sigmoid tumours. The mean duration of surgery was 258(11) min. No conversion to laparotomy was needed, and there were no deaths. Five patients required additional ports, for intraoperative bleeding (1), suture of an intraoperative urethral injury with covering ileostomy (1) and difficulty in dissection (3). One patient had an anastomotic leak requiring transanal closure and ileostomy on day 7. Both ileostomies were closed after 2 months. The mean hospital stay was 64(18) days. All resections were R0.

Prometheus is the figure par excellence of human forethought and progress in the anthropocene. In this article, we introduce the concept of ambient Prometheanism to describe the way of thinking that foregrounds foresight and anticipation and advances technological solutions developed by capital and energy-intensive projects. We question this stance, arguing that ambient Prometheanism, with its emphasis on technofix, leads to the economisation and depoliticisation of planetary environmental issues. Following Bernard Stiegler, we recover from the myth the figure of Epimetheus, Prometheus brother, as well as his associated faculty, epimetheia to theorise what we call an Epimethean politics. Thinking the anthropocene from the perspective of ambient Prometheanism and Epimetheanism means to consider the role of technology in climate politics, and in particular to make the case for the importance of afterthought in face of unintended consequences and accumulated errors. To substantiate our argument, we outline the challenge posed by emerging solutions focussed on technological intensification (geoengineering) and socio-economic acceleration (green growth and accelerationism). An Epimethean politics of the climate requires to use reflexivity as a capacity to anticipate, but also to mobilise epimetheia to account for accidents and past mistakes. Such a politics builds from an alternative conception of technology, one that radically differs from ambient Prometheanism. Finally we read as actualisations of Epimethean politics contemporary eco-political struggles and their imperatives for multispecies living and convivial livelihoods.","output":"Beyond technofix: Thinking with Epimetheus in the anthropocene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time of COVID-19 represents a distinct, but currently under-defined and under-theorised, temporal moment Using semiotic methods, this paper examines how the mechanical actions of the virus, through becoming social, create a new viral time, heralding an already-arrived new historical epoch This epoch, which is simultaneously both homogenous and undifferentiated at one tempo, and supercharged with change, events and radically uncertain futurity at another, is riven with revolutionary potential The existential challenge posed to the faltering socio-economic order is evidenced by a panicked political response combining reactionary attempts to reimpose temporal certainty and fixity, with desperate material concessions to a public suddenly expelled from a previously subsuming dominant productive time of capitalism As such, this temporal crisis offers the necessary, if not sufficient, moment for profound re-imaginings of our productive and social relations, and an opportunity to look beyond the possible end of the world, and towards the end of capitalism","output":"Having a moment: the revolutionary semiotic of COVID-19 [version 1;peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to provide pediatric neuropsychologists with suggested processes and procedures to continue to provide neuropsychology services during the COVID-19 global pandemic.

However, a standalone datum is not perceiving the context of the holistic cluster, and may undergo sub-optimal assignment. In this paper, we extend the mainstream contrastive learning paradigm to a cluster-level scheme, where all the data subjected to the same cluster contribute to a unified representation that encodes the context of each data group. Contrastive learning with this representation then rewards the assignment of each datum. To implement this vision, we propose twin-contrast clustering (TCC). We define a set of categorical variables as clustering assignment confidence, which links the instance-level learning track with the cluster-level one. On one hand, with the corresponding assignment variables being the weight, a weighted aggregation along the data points implements the set representation of a cluster. We further propose heuristic cluster augmentation equivalents to enable cluster-level contrastive learning. On the other hand, we derive the evidence lower-bound of the instance-level contrastive objective with the assignments.

The development of animal models of cSCI will aid in the pre-clinical assessment of therapies and in understanding basic pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, we describe a clinically relevant model of cervical contusion-compression injury in the mouse. Using a modified aneurysm clip, we generated a bilateral, incomplete injury that mimics contusion-compression injuries most commonly observed in humans. We followed the recovery of injured and sham-operated (laminectomy-only) animals for 8 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral tests, including the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), wire hanging, grip strength, and CatWalk automated gait analysis, showed that while natural recovery is limited, it occurs in a clinically relevant window during the subacute phase of injury (7-14 days post-SCI). BMS scoring demonstrated that, while injured animals are ambulatory, they do not recover normal locomotor ability. CatWalk analysis quantitatively showed a loss of coordination and motor ability, with minimal recovery. The wire hanging and grip strength tests confirmed a significant decrease in forelimb motor strength in injured animals. Histological analysis carried out during the subacute phase (7-day time point) and chronic phase (8-week time point) demonstrated that the lesion epicenter is formed by 7 days post-SCI. Volumetric analysis of protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma)-stained axons revealed that this injury results in significant damage to the corticospinal tract caudal to the injury site. Finally, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to show that genes associated with inflammation and glial scarring are upregulated as a result of injury.

In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. RESULTS: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21C88 years]; 64% [36/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31/87), hypertension (37%, 32/87), and diabetes (24%, 24/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27C88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87C1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions. If further validated on additional cohorts of patients, this model/clinical tool may provide useful prognostication of critical care needs.","output":"Development and external validation of a prognostic tool for COVID-19 critical disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The selection of the appropriate aircraft can bring competitive advantages to airlines, however, there are a number of factors which introduce a degree of uncertainty to the selection process.

Therefore, we focused on the multi-dimensional evaluation and selection of the most suitable commercial aircraft alternatives by using new MCDM method. This article provides decision support to airline planners on the selection of commercial aircraft under uncertainty.

They play roles in various biological processes. However, little is known about their evolutionary history and their functions in plant stress regulation. The availability of full genome sequences from various plant species makes it possible to perform a whole-genome exploration for further understanding their biological functions. RESULTS: Higher plant genomes encode large numbers of lectin proteins. Based on their domain structures and phylogenetic analyses, a new classification system has been proposed. In this system, 12 different families have been classified and four of them consist of recently identified plant lectin members. Further analyses show that some of lectin families exhibit species-specific expansion and rapid birth-and-death evolution. Tandem and segmental duplications have been regarded as the major mechanisms to drive lectin expansion although retrogenes also significantly contributed to the birth of new lectin genes in soybean and rice. Evidence shows that lectin genes have been involved in biotic/abiotic stress regulations and tandem/segmental duplications may be regarded as drivers for plants to adapt various environmental stresses through duplication followed by expression divergence. Each member of this gene superfamily may play specialized roles in a specific stress condition and function as a regulator of various environmental factors such as cold, drought and high salinity as well as biotic stresses.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020 (during the time-period before the start of Unlock 1.0 in India on and from June 08, 2020), and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors C Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein C host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R(2) = 0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate.

RECENT FINDINGS Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7-14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. SUMMARY Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.","output":"How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The confinement decreed in Colombia, in order to mitigate the impacts caused by COVID- 19, has led small merchants to bankruptcy, since they did not have access to digital tools that would allow them to market their products, or compete with large stores.

A major cause of morbimortality in this condition are pulmonary exacerbations. Although classically attributed to bacterial infections, respiratory virus have been increasingly recognized in its ethiopathogeny. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children < 18 years old with CF in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with pulmonary exacerbation criteria. Samples were submitted to RT-PCR for Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Metapneumovirus and Rhinovirus. Virus positive and virus negative groups were compared in regards to clinical presentation, severity of exacerbation and bacterial colonization. RESULTS: Out of 70 samples collected from 48 patients, 35.7% were positive for respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus were the most common (28% of all positive samples), followed by RSV. The virus positive group was associated with change in sinus discharge (p = 0.03). Considering only patients younger than five years old, positive virus detection was also associated with fever (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in clinical severity or in bacterial colonization between virus positive and negative groups.

Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1C4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-Flavivirus medications.","output":"Cephalotaxine inhibits Zika infection by impeding viral replication and stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has experienced a prolonged outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus since 2012.

Methods: 1500 of HCWs from Saudi Ministry of Health were invited to fill a questionnaire developed to cover the survey objectives from 9 September 2015 to 8 November 2015. The response rate was about 81%. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise the responses. Results: 1216 HCWs were included in this survey. A total of 56.5% were nurses and 22% were physicians. The most common sources of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) memo (74.3%). Only (47.6%) of the physicians, (30.4%) of the nurses and (29.9%) of the other HCWs were aware that asymptomatic MERS-CoV was described. Around half of respondents who having been investigated for MERS-CoV reported that their work performance decreased while they have suspicion of having MERS-CoV and almost two thirds reported having psychological problems during this period. Almost two thirds of the HCWs (61.2%) reported anxiety about contracting MERS-CoV from patients.

Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score ([]15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week.

Inadequate access to cultural foods can create cultural stress and affect ones identity and well-being. In particular, second-generation U.S. American student populations may have a higher risk for cultural stress due to being away from family, academic stress, environmental changes, and diminished financial stability to purchase cultural foods. Thus, an exploratory qualitative methodology was used to elicit information about second-generation U.S. Americans food experiences to identify how cultural foods play a role in individual identity and how individual well-being is influenced by the presence or lack of cultural foods. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with second-generation American students at the University of Nevada, Reno, who self-identified as a cultural or ethnic minority. A standard thematic analysis was conducted. The authors identified that cultural food security influenced the ability to practice foodways, which tied Second-generation American students to their cultural identities. The absence of foodways led to anxiety and depression among students, amplifying the feelings of identity degradation. Second-generation American students discussed that the ability to practice their foodways improved multiple well-being components and led to feelings of happiness, decreased stress, warmth, better digestion, and a sense of belonging, comfort, and safety.

Surface coating of medical devices/implants using antibacterial peptides and enzymes has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for preventing infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hernia repair meshes coated by the antimicrobial enzyme lysostaphin at different initial concentrations. Lysostaphin was adsorbed on pieces of polypropylene (Ultrapro) mesh with binding yields of 10 to 40% at different coating concentrations of between 10 and 500 g/ml. Leaching of enzyme from the surface of all the samples was studied in 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 37C, and it was found that less than 3% of adsorbed enzyme desorbed from the surface after 24 h of incubation. Studies of antibacterial activity against a cell suspension of S. aureus were performed using turbidity assay and demonstrated that the small amount of enzyme leaching from the mesh surface contributes to the lytic activity of the lysostaphin-coated samples. Colony counting data from the broth count (model for bacteria in wound fluid) and wash count (model for colonized bacteria) for the enzyme-coated samples showed significantly decreased numbers of CFU compared to uncoated samples (P < 0.05). A pilot in vivo study showed a dose-dependent efficacy of lysostaphin-coated meshes in a rat model of S. aureus infection. The antimicrobial activity of the lysostaphin-coated meshes suggests that such enzyme-leaching surfaces could be efficient at actively resisting initial bacterial adhesion and preventing subsequent colonization of hernia repair meshes.","output":"Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin-coated hernia repair meshes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 exposed a global problem, as highly effective vaccines are challenging to produce and distribute, particularly in regions with limited resources and funding. As an alternative, immunoglobulins produced in eggs of immunized hens (IgY) can be a simple and inexpensive source for a topical and temporary prophylaxis. Here, we developed a method to extract and purify IgY antibodies from egg yolks of hens immunized against viral pathogen-derived proteins using low-cost, readily available materials, for use in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Existing protocols for IgY purification and equipment were modified, including extraction from yolks and separation of water-soluble IgY using common household reagents and tools. A replacement for a commercial centrifuge was developed, using a home food processor equipped with a 3D printed adapter to enable IgY precipitation. IgY purification was verified using standard gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: We developed a step-by-step protocol for IgY purification for two settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC): a local laboratory, where commercial centrifuges are available, or a more rural setting, where an alternative for expensive centrifuges can be used. Gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses confirmed that the method produced highly enriched IgY preparation; each commercial egg produced ~ 90 mg of IgY. We also designed a kit for IgY production in these two settings and provided a cost estimate of the kit. CONCLUSION: IgY purified from eggs of immunized local hens can offer a fast and affordable prophylaxis, provided that purification can be performed in a resource-limited setting. Here, we created a low-cost method that can be used anywhere where electricity is available using inexpensive, readily available materials in place of costly, specialized laboratory equipment and chemicals.

We sought to investigate whether humans using ACEI were at increased risk of S. aureus infection, comparing them to users of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB) with multiple control outcomes to assess the potential for residual confounding. Methods: Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics between 1997 and 2017, we identified adults starting ACEI or ARB (as an active comparator drug). We regarded prescription of ACEI or ARB as time-dependent exposure and used a Cox regression model to compare incidence of first hospitalisation with infection due to S. aureus in periods with ACEI to periods with ARB prescriptions. We repeated the analysis using control outcomes that we did not expect to be associated with use of ACEI versus ARB (Gram-negative sepsis, hip fracture and herpes zoster) and one that we did (dry cough). Results: We identified 445,341 new users of ACEI (mean age 64.014.0, male 51.7%) and 41,824 new users of ARB (mean age 64.114.0, male 45.5%). The fully adjusted hazard ratio for S. aureus infection (ACEI vs. ARB) was 1.18 (95% CI 1.10-1.27), consistent across sensitivity analyses. However, we also found associations with all control outcomes; rates of Gram-negative sepsis, hip fracture and dry cough were also increased during periods of time treated with ACEI compared to ARB while herpes zoster was more common during time treated with ARB. Conclusions: Our results suggest that although ARB users appear an ideal control for analyses of ACEI effects, there is residual confounding even after multivariable adjustment. This has implications for observational analyses comparing users of these drug classes, in particular the effect of these drugs in relation to COVID-19 infection.","output":"Comparisons of Staphylococcus aureus infection and other outcomes between users of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers: Lessons for COVID-19 from a nationwide cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Antecedentes y objetivo: La pandemia actual por COVID-19 est generando un elevado nmero de pacientes, que necesitan ingreso hospitalario por neumona y que, tras su alta hospitalaria, precisan de un control evolutivo por persistencia de sintomatologa Dada la poca evidencia existente sobre el abordaje fisioterpico de estos pacientes y las restricciones de acceso al centro de salud, el objetivo es comprobar si una intervencin de Fisioterapia en Atencin Primaria (FAP), realizada a un paciente, travs de consulta no presencial (CNP), es eficaz Material y mtodos: Se realiz la intervencin fisioterpica: mediante CNP por va telefnica, a un paciente varn de 47 a?os, a los 7 das tras ser dado de alta de neumona por COVID-19 Se efectu seguimiento de la disnea a travs de escala de Borg modificada y escala del Medical Research Council (mMRC), pruebas de funcin fsica a travs del Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) y de la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud (CVRS), mediante la encuesta EuroQol-5D, as como del control evolutivo de constantes fisiolgicas (temperatura, frecuencia cardiaca y saturacin de oxigeno) durante 28 das de seguimiento La intervencin consisti en un programa de educacin para la salud y ejercicio teraputico Resultados y conclusiones: El programa de atencin fisioterpica telefnica ha permitido el tratamiento y el seguimiento del paciente (variables fisiolgicas, SPPB, CVRS, en las que se ha objetivado mejora) Por lo que este tipo de intervenciones mediante CNP, para pacientes dados de alta de neumona COVID-19, merecen ser estudiados en profundidad, en futuros estudios Background and Aim: The current COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in a high number of patients who need hospital admission for pneumonia and in many cases subsequent follow-up due to persistent symptoms Since there is little existing evidence on the physiotherapy treatment approach, and there are restrictions to usual consultation, the aim is to check whether Physical Therapy Primary Care (PTPC) intervention through remote consultation is effective Material and Methods: A 47-year-old male patient underwent a physiotherapy intervention through remote consultation (RC) over the phone 7 days after being discharged On the one hand, dyspnoea was followed up by employing the modified Borg scale and modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC), where physical function is assessed through the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) On the other hand, the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) was assessed through the EuroQol-5D questionnaire, and vital signs (temperature, heart rate and oxygen pressure) were monitored for 28 days The intervention consisted of an educational programme for health and exercise therapy Results and Conclusions: The physiotherapy phone consultation programme allowed the treatment and follow up of this patient (physiological variables, SPPB and HRQL) which resulted in improvement Therefore, we suggest future trials are worth undertaking to study in-depth interventions based on remote consultation directed at these patients after discharge","output":"Eficacia del tratamiento fisioterpico en Atencin Primaria, mediante consulta no presencial, a un paciente dado de alta de neumona Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in regulating gene expression and are related to tumor progression.

DESIGN: Cohort study with follow-up between 12 March 2020 and 23 February 2021. SETTING: Swedish register-based study on all residents in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 3 963 356 Swedish residents in co-residential unions who were 30 years of age or older and alive on 12 March 2020 and living in Sweden in December 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox regression models were conducted to assess the association between different constellations of immigrant-native couples (proxy for language proficiency and institutional awareness) and COVID-19 mortality and all other causes of deaths (2019 and 2020). Models were adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Compared with Swedish-Swedish couples (1.18 deaths per thousand person-years), both immigrants partnered with another immigrant and a native showed excess mortality for COVID-19 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.58 and HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.40, respectively), which translates to 1.37 and 1.28 deaths per thousand person-years. Moreover, similar results are found for natives partnered with an immigrant (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29), which translates to 1.29 deaths per thousand person-years. Further analysis shows that immigrants from both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) experience excess mortality also when partnered with a Swede. However, having a Swedish-born partner is only partially protective against COVID-19 mortality among immigrants from LMIC origins. CONCLUSIONS: Language barriers and/or poor institutional awareness are not major drivers for the excess mortality from COVID-19 among immigrants.

To better understand the global pattern of this relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis on endothelial biomarkers related to COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We systematically searched the literature up to March 10, 2021, for studies investigating the association between COVID-19 severity and the following endothelial biomarkers: Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin, Von Willebrand Factor Antigen (VWF-Ag), soluble Thrombomodulin (sTM), Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). Pooled estimates and mean differences (PMD) for each biomarker were reported. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (n=2213 patients) were included. Critically ill patients presented with higher levels of MR-proADM (PMD: 0.71 nmol/L, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.20 nmol/L, p=0.02), E-selectin (PMD: 13,32 pg/ml, 95% CI: 4,89 to 21,75 pg/ml, p=0.008), VCAM-1 (PMD: 479 ng/ml, 95% CI: 64 to 896 ng/ml, p=0.03), VWF-Ag (PMD: 110.5 IU/dl, 95% CI: 44.8 to 176.1 IU/dl, p=0.04) and Ang-2 (PMD: 2388 pg/ml, 95% CI: 1121 to 3655 pg/ml, p=0.003), as compared to non-critically ill ones. ICAM-1, P-selectin and thrombomodulin did not differ between the two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Endothelial biomarkers display significant heterogeneity in COVID-19 patients, with higher MR-proADM, E-selectin, VCAM-1, VWF-Ag, and Ang-2 levels being associated with increased severity.

Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease.","output":"IL-1, IL-6, and RANTES as Biomarkers of Chikungunya Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: At the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the United States, testing was limited to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-developed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay.

METHODS: The American Proficiency Institute sent 2 test samples to 346 clinical laboratories in order to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 assays. The positive sample, containing 5,175 viral copies/mL, was fully extractable with SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid protein and RNA. The negative sample, with 3,951 viral copies/mL, contained recombinant virus particles with sequences for targeting human RNAase P gene sequences. RESULTS: Of the laboratories submitting results, 97.4% (302/310) correctly detected the virus when present and 98.3% (296/301) correctly indicated when the virus was not present. Among incorrect results reported in this proficiency challenge, 76.9% (10/13) were likely related to clerical error. This accounts for 1.6% (10/611) of all reported results.

Methods: On April 20 th, 2020, we search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv. We used terms related to COVID-19, smell and taste disorders. We selected case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. We included studies with COVID-19 patients describing their symptoms; studies that compared smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 patients and otherwise healthy subjects; and studies comparing smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 severe and mild/moderate cases. Because of methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of results, a qualitative synthesis is presented. Results: From 31 reports, we selected six (n=2,757). Six studies reported the proportion of smell and taste disorders among COVID-19 patients. Two reports studied whether smell and taste disorders were independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. No reports studied the association with impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The frequency of anosmia ranged between 22%-68%. The definition of taste disorders varied greatly, with dysgeusia present in 33% and ageusia in 20%. People who reported loss of smell and taste had six-fold higher odds of being COVID-19 positive; similarly, anosmia and ageusia were associated with 10-fold higher odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: The frequency of smell and taste disorders is as high as other symptoms, thus, at least anosmia for which the definition was more consistent, could be included in lists of COVID-19 symptoms. Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.

This study aimed to illustrate the clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and DM in Bangladesh while comparing survivors and deceased. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus in a specialized COVID-19 hospital in Bangladesh. Data from hospital records were analyzed. Among 921 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 admitted during the study period, 231 (~25%) patients with pre-existing DM (median age 60 years) were included in the analysis. The death rate among all hospitalized patients (with and without DM) was 2.8% compared to 11.3% among diabetic patients. The median hospital stay was 13 days (IQR 10.5, 17.0) for survivors and five days (IQR 2.0-8.3) for the deceased. The clinical features were not significantly different between survivors and the deceased.

We aimed to assess the utility of NLR as a predictor of lung cancer-specific survival (LCS) and identify an optimal, pretreatment cutoff point in patients with localized NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) within the Veterans Affairs (VA) national database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the VA database, we identified patients with biopsy-proven, clinical stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2006 and 2015. Cutoff points for NLR were calculated using Contal/OQuigleys and Cox Wald methods. Primary outcomes of OS, LCS, and non-lung cancer survival (NCS) were evaluated in Cox and Fine-Gray models. RESULTS: In 389 patients, optimal NLR cutoff was identified as 4.0. In multivariable models, NLR > 4.0 was associated with decreased OS (HR 1.44, p = 0.01) and NCS (HR 1.68, p = 0.01) but not with LCS (HR 1.32, p = 0.09). In a subset analysis of 229 patients with pulmonary function tests, NLR > 4.0 remained associated with worse OS (HR 1.51, p = 0.02) and NCS (HR 2.18, p = 0.01) while the association with LCS decreased further (HR 1.22, p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: NLR was associated with worse OS in patients with localized NSCLC treated with SBRT; however, NLR was only associated with NCS and not with LCS. Pretreatment NLR, with a cutoff of 4.0, offers potential as a marker of competing mortality risk which can aid in risk stratification in this typically frail and comorbid population.

METHODS Patients undergoing resection of ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer between 2005 and 2019 were identified using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Patients were classified based on specific, pre-defined malnutrition criteria: severe malnutrition (Body Mass Index (BMI) <18.5 + 10% weight loss), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism ((ESPEN1); BMI 18.5-22 + 10% weight loss), ESPEN2 (BMI < 18.5), American Cancer Society ((ACS); normal/overweight BMI + 10% weight loss), mild malnutrition (BMI 18.5-22), or albumin (<3.5 g/dL). Outcomes included 30-day major complications, readmission, reoperation. Modified Poisson regression estimated associations between definitions and outcomes. RESULTS Of 76,290 total patients undergoing surgery, those meeting malnutrition definitions were: severe-98 (0.1%), ESPEN1-148 (0.2%), ESPEN2-877 (1.1%), ACS-1028 (1.3%), mild-2853 (3.7%), and albumin (11.1%). Complication rates were: unplanned readmission-5.5%, reoperation-1.7%, major complications-13.5%. For ovarian cancer, ESPEN2 malnutrition was associated with higher readmissions (risk ratio 1.69; 95% confidence interval 1.29-2.20), reoperations (2.53; 1.70-3.77), and complications (1.36; 1.20-1.54). For uterine cancer, ACS malnutrition was associated with readmissions (2.74; 2.09-3.59), reoperations (3.61; 2.29-5.71) and complications (3.92; 3.40-4.53).

During Covid-19 pandemic, socioeconomic deprivation, social isolation, and reduced physical activities may induce heart failure (HF), destabilization, and cause more complications. HF appears as a potential hazard due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, chiefly in elderly patients with underlying comorbidities. In reality, the expression of cardiac ACE2 is implicated as a target point for SARS-CoV-2-induced acute cardiac injury. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, like other febrile illnesses, high blood viscosity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction-induced coagulation disorders may increase risk of HF development. Hypoxic respiratory failure, as in pulmonary edema, severe acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may affect heart hemodynamic stability due to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, Covid-19-induced HF could be through the development of cytokine storm, characterized by high proliferation pro-inflammatory cytokines. In cytokine storm-mediated cardiac dysfunction, there is a positive correlation between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and myocarditis-induced acute cardiac injury biomarkers. Therefore, Covid-19-induced HF is more complex and related from a molecular background in releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines to the neuro-metabolic derangements that together affect cardiomyocyte functions and development of HF. Anti-heart failure medications, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory properties that may mitigate Covid-19 severity and development of HF. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the development of HF due to direct acute cardiac injury or through the development of cytokine storms, which depress cardiomyocyte function and cardiac contractility. Anti-heart failure drugs, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, may attenuate severity of HF by reducing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the development of cytokine storms in severely affected Covid-19 patients.","output":"Covid-19 and development of heart failure: mystery and truth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid protein detection and quantification at the single-molecule level in a format that is simple and robust enough for widespread point-of-care applications.

A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0C3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6C14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9C8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7C8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence.

In the case of class I viral fusion proteins, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and protein stabilization techniques have highlighted the importance of cryptic or alternative conformations that expose epitopes targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. Thorough epitope mapping of such metastable conformations is difficult, but is critical for understanding sites of vulnerability in class I fusion proteins that occur as transient conformational states during viral attachment and fusion. We introduce a novel method Accelerated class I fusion protein Epitope Mapping (AxIEM) that accounts for fusion protein flexibility to significantly improve out-of-sample prediction of discontinuous antibody epitopes. Harnessing data from previous experimental epitope mapping efforts of several class I fusion proteins, we demonstrate that accuracy of epitope prediction depends on residue environment and allows for the precise prediction of conformation-dependent antibody target residues. We also show that AxIEM can to identify common epitopes and provide structural insights for the development and rational design of vaccines. Author Summary Efficient determination of neutralizing epitopes of viral fusion proteins is paramount in the development of antibody-based therapeutics against rapidly evolving or undercharacterized viral pathogens. Advances in the determination of viral fusion proteins in multiple conformations with cryptic epitopes during attachment and fusion has highlighted the importance of epitope accessibility due to viral fusion protein flexibility, a physical trait not accounted for in previous B-cell epitope prediction methods. Given the relatively limited number of viral fusion proteins that have been determined in multiple conformations that also have been extensively subjected to epitope mapping techniques,, which are predominantly class I fusion proteins, we chose a limited feature set in combination with a low-complexity Bayesian classifier model to avoid overfitting. We show that this model demonstrates higher accuracy in out-of-sample performance than publicly available epitope prediction methods. Additionally, due to limited structural annotation of neutralizing epitope residues, we provide examples of how our model better discerns conformation-specific epitopes, which is critical for subunit vaccine design, and how this may provide a novel approach to assess the structural changes of antigenicity of viral fusion protein homologues.","output":"Computational epitope mapping of class I fusion proteins using Bayes classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcomes of chronically ventilated patients outside the setting of intensive care units. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Studies evaluating patients on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in different care settings. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS and Scopus databases from inception to March 27, 2020. Studies reporting mortality outcomes of patients 18 years of age on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and other care settings were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Sixty studies were included in the systematic review. Mortality rates ranged from 13.7% to 77.8% in ICUs (n = 17 studies), 7.8%C51.0% in non-ICUs including step-down units and inpatient wards (n = 26 studies), and 12.0%C91.8% in home or nursing home settings (n = 19 studies). Age was associated with mortality in all care settings. Weaning rates ranged from 10.0% to 78.2% across non-ICU studies. Studies reporting weaning as their primary outcome demonstrated higher success rates in weaning. Home care studies reported low incidences of ventilator failure. None of the studies reported ventilator malfunction as the primary cause of death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality outcomes across various settings were disparate due to methodological and clinical heterogeneity among studies. However, there is evidence to suggest non-ICU venues of care as a comparable alternative to ICUs for stable, chronically ventilated patients, with the additional benefit of providing specialized weaning programs. By synthesizing the global data on managing chronically ventilated patients in various care settings, this study provides health care systems and providers alternative venue options for the delivery of prolonged ventilatory care in the context of limited ICU resources.","output":"Mortality outcomes of patients on chronic mechanical ventilation in different care settings: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is seen in one-fifth of pediatric patients with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and residual kidney impairment. The majority of kidney pathology data in patients with COVID-19 is derived from adult case series and there is an overall lack of histologic data for most pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We assembled a multi-institutional cohort of five unvaccinated pediatric patients with COVID-19 and associated kidney dysfunction with available histology. RESULTS: Three complex patients with current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had multifactorial thrombotic microangiopathy with clinical features of hemolytic uremic syndrome (in two) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (in one); one died and another developed chronic kidney disease stage 5. Two with recently preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with nephrotic syndrome; one had IgA vasculitis and one had minimal change disease. Within a short follow-up time, none has returned to baseline kidney function.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared to: (1) non-pregnant controls and (2) natural COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131) and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, second vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (N=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared to those of pregnant women 4-12 weeks from natural infection (N=37) by ELISA. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared to non-pregnant women (median [IQR] 5.59 [4.68-5.89] pregnant, 5.74 [5.06-6.22] lactating, 5.62 [4.77-5.98] non-pregnant, p = 0.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (p < 0.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord compared to maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (median [IQR] 104.7 [61.2-188.2] maternal sera, 52.3 [11.7-69.6] cord sera, p=0.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, but not IgA, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women.

Recent attempts to quantify such impacts mainly focused on a basin or larger scale, or used limited time periods that largely ignore observations of long-term trends at a fine resolution, thereby affecting the recognition of climate changes effect on ecosystem services. OBJECTIVES: This study conducts a detailed and spatially explicit recognition of climate changes effect on ecosystem services and provides an intuitive map for decision-making and climate change adaptation planning. METHODS: We used long-term time series of ecosystem service assessments and various future climate scenarios to quantify the sensitivity and future exposure of ecosystem services to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. RESULTS: Carbon sequestration (CS) and habitat quality experience significant growth, while water retention did not show any trend. Sensitivity patterns of these ecosystem services vary largely. For CS, more than half of the pixels showed a positive sensitivity to climate change, even though the degree of sensitivity is not high. There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in the exposure of ecosystem services to future climate changes, and high levels of future climate change increase the intensity of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the complex spatial association between ecosystem services and climatic drivers, and these findings can help optimize local response strategies in the context of global warming. For example, the existing protected areas have notable conservation gaps for disturbance of future climate change on ecosystem services, especially in the southeastern part of the study area.

Chest CT is useful to evaluate changes in the lung parenchyma over time. Purpose To illustrate the temporal change of lung abnormalities on chest CT associated with COVID-19 pneumonia over 1-year. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, patients previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia who visited a radiology Department of a tertiary care center for imaging follow-up were consecutively enrolled between March 2020 and July 2021. Exclusion criteria were acute respiratory distress syndrome or required intubation/mechanical ventilation, pulmonary embolism and any interstitial lung disease. High-resolution volumetric non-contrast chest CT scans were acquired at 3, 6, and 12 months from the first diagnosis and were compared with baseline CT. The imaging features analyzed were ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, pleuro-parenchymal band, linear atelectasis, bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis, and honeycombing. The prevalence distribution of lung abnormalities was recorded at all time points. Results Eighty-four participants (56 men; mean age 6111years) were studied. GGOs and consolidations represented the main baseline lung abnormalities, accounting for a median severity score of 9 [IQR 7-12.7] (maximum possible score, 20), indicating of moderate lung involvement. The baseline prevalence of GGOs decreased from 100% to 2% of participants at 1-year while that of consolidations from 71% to 0% at 6 months. Fibrotic-like abnormalities (pleuro-parenchymal bands, linear atelectasis, bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis) were detected at 3 months (50% of participants), 6 months (42%), and 1-year (only 5%). Among these, pleuro-parenchymal bands were the most represented finding. Fibrotic changes (reticulation and traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis) were detected at 3-6 months (2%) and remained stable at 1-year, with no evidence of honeycombing. At 1 year, lung abnormalities due to COVID-19 pneumonia were completely resolved in 78/84 (93%) participants.

Traditionally, donor sites are left to heal with a primary dressing so wounds are not left open. However, a delay in healing accompanied by pain at a donor site is often seen. This study primarily throws light on the use of autologous PRP over split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites to promote healing and reduce pain. METHOD: The patients enrolled in this study in 2018-2019 were divided into two groups: the intervention group received autologous PRP applied topically at the donor site; in the control group, the wound was dressed traditionally. Pain scales were measured in the immediate postoperative period at six hours, 10 hours and 16 hours. The dressing was opened on the postoperative day 14 and observed for healing by an independent observer. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. Patients in the PRP group showed statistically significant faster healing at postoperative day 14 compared with the control group (p<0.05), who required dressings for 3-4 weeks postoperatively. Pain scale scores in the postoperative period were significantly less in the PRP group at six hours postoperatively compared with the control group (p<0.05). There was a reduced incidence of hypertrophic scar formation in the small number of patients in the PRP group who had developed hypertrophic scar previously. CONCLUSION: Application of PRP is a safe, cost-effective and easy method to achieve faster healing in graft donor site areas that are troublesome to both patients and doctors. It also reduces postoperative pain at donor sites. The authors recommend PRP is used more often in the management of donor sites for STSGs.","output":"Application of autologous platelet-rich plasma to graft donor sites to reduce pain and promote healing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Seasonal influenza vaccination for the elderly is highly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Japan, the amount of subsidy for influenza differs among municipalities. Thus, we investigated the amount of and variation in subsidy for influenza vaccination for the elderly in 2020. Methods This was an ecological study of 1,922 municipalities in Japan. The amount of subsidy for influenza vaccines for the elderly in each municipality was surveyed through websites or via telephone. Geographic and financial data for municipalities and prefectures were obtained from the open data. The amount of co-payment for the influenza vaccine and the geographical and financial status of each municipality were compared, according to the aging rate. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors related to the free influenza vaccine. Results Municipalities with higher aging rates tended to have higher median co-payments for vaccines in 2020. (0 yen vs 1000 yen, p < 0.001) In addition, they tended to have worse financial conditions and lower per capita incomes. A similar trend was observed in the analysis by prefecture, i.e., a higher influenza mortality rate in prefectures with a higher aging rate. Despite having lower incomes, municipalities and prefectures with higher aging populations had higher mortality rates from influenza and higher co-payments for influenza vaccination. Conclusions In Japan, there is a disparity among elderly people;areas with an aging population have higher co-payments for influenza vaccines despite lower incomes, suggesting that the government needs to implement corrective measures to reduce this disparity.","output":"Disparities in co-payments for influenza vaccine among the elderly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore experiences of communication as an element of quality of care, among women surviving a maternal near-miss event, thus women who nearly died but survived haemorrhage, or pre-eclampsia complication during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.

Computed tomography (CT) is a diagnostic tool used by radiologists to treat COVID patients. COVID x-ray images have inherent texture variations and similarity to other diseases like pneumonia. Manually diagnosing COVID X-ray images is a tedious and challenging process. Extracting the discriminant features and fine-tuning the classifiers using low-resolution images with a limited COVID x-ray dataset is a major challenge in computer aided diagnosis. The present work addresses this issue by proposing and implementing Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) features trained with an optimized Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed HOG feature extraction method is evaluated with Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Hu moments. Results confirm that HOG is found to reflect the local description of edges effectively and provide excellent structural features to discriminate COVID and non-COVID when compared to the other feature extraction techniques. The performance of the RF is compared with other classifiers such as Linear Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (kNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP).

For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without quantization.

The provision of care is based on the principles of independent medical practice, free choice of physician and care facility, and predominantly fee-for-service payment. The Belgian population enjoys good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to the population's good access to many high-quality health services. However, some challenges remain in terms of appropriateness of pharmaceutical care (overuse of antibiotics and psychotropic drugs), reduced accessibility for mental health and dental care due to higher user charges, socioeconomic inequalities in health status and the need for further strengthening of prevention policies.

Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16. Results In the present study, we proposed a two-route model to answer how the RTC functions in the jumping transcription of CoVs. The key step leading to this model was that the motif AAACH for METTL3 recognition flanking the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif was discovered to determine the m6A methylation of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, by reanalyzing public Nanopore RNA-seq data. As the most important finding, TRS hairpins were reported for the first time to interpret NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation of CoVs and their association at the molecular level. In addition, we reported canonical TRS motifs of all CoVs to prove the importance of our findings. Conclusions The main conclusions are: (1) TRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes; (2) RNA methylation of CoVs participates in the determination of the RNA secondary structures by affecting the formation of base pairing; and (3) The eventual determination of the CoV RTC global structure needs to consider METTL3 in the experimental design. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a crucial basis for future studies.","output":"How the replication and transcription complex functions in jumping transcription of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the risk profiles attributable to psychosocial and behavioural problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To this end, we created a risk-prediction nomogram model. METHODS: A national multicentre study was conducted through an online questionnaire involving 12,186 children (6-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old). Respondents psychosocial and behavioural functioning were assessed using the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Data were analysed using STATA software and R-language. RESULTS: The positive detection rate of psychological problems within Wuhan was greater than that outside Wuhan for schizoid (P = 0.005), and depression (P = 0.030) in children, and for somatic complaints (P = 0.048), immaturity (P = 0.023), and delinquent behaviour (P = 0.046) in adolescents. After graded multivariable adjustment, seven factors associated with psychological problems in children and adolescents outside Wuhan were parent-child conflict (odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.27-5.72), sleep problems (OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 3.77-4.36), online study time (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.37-0.47), physical activity time (OR: 0.510, 95% CI: 0.44-0.59), number of close friends (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.6), time spent playing videogames (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.90-2.69) and eating disorders (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 2.35-3.11) (all P < 0.001). Contrastingly, within Wuhan, only the first four factors, namely, parent-child conflict (5.95, 2.82-12.57), sleep problems (4.47, 3.06-6.54), online study time (0.37, 0.22-0.64), and physical activity time (0.42, 0.22-0.80) were identified (all P < 0.01). Accordingly, nomogram models were created with significant attributes and had decent prediction performance with C-indexes over 80%. LIMITATION: A cross-sectional study and self-reported measures. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the four significant risk factors within and outside Wuhan, the three additional factors outside Wuhan deserve special attention. The prediction nomogram models constructed in this study have important clinical and public health implications for psychosocial and behavioural assessment.","output":"Risk factors and prediction nomogram model for psychosocial and behavioural problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national multicentre study: Risk Factors of Childhood Psychosocial Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: We explored the coping reflections of elderly couples living alone (without any other family members) during the COVID-19 pandemic in urban Odisha, India. BACKGROUND: Evidence worldwide suggests that older people are at increased risk from COVID-19 adverse outcomes and experience greater stress. In our previous community-based study urban dwelling, particularly elderly participants, and living alone reported higher pandemic-associated health care challenges than their rural and residing-with-family counterparts. We intended to explore how the elderly couples living alone coped through this challenging yet stressful situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and what were their key strategies adopted toward this. METHODS: We conducted telephonic in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 11 urban elderly couples living alone in Bhubaneswar city of Odisha, India using a semi-structured interview guide. All IDIs were digitally recorded, transcribed into the original language, and translated to English. We used a thematic approach for analysis. FINDINGS: Four themes emerged: (1) Risk appraisal and feeling vulnerable; (2) Safeguarding against COVID-19; (3) Managing routine health care and emergency; and (4) Pursuing mental and psychological well-being. Although fear, anxiety, and loneliness were continuing stressors, many of them learnt to adapt and emerge resilient with the evolving situation. Various elements at the individual, family, community, and organizational levels were conducive to better coping. The companionship and complementary support of spouse, self-health literacy, and digital efficacy, virtual connectedness with family and friends, availability of community pharmacy and diagnostic services in the vicinity, support of neighbors, reengaging with creative leisure time activity, and assurance of a responsive administration at the time of emergency helped them to cruise through the pandemic. Furthermore, watching the re-telecast of prime time serials made these elderly fondly remember their own youth time memories. Self-health monitoring, indoor physical exercise, spiritual practices, continuation of previous prescription, telephonic advice of physicians were add-on strategies that facilitated their physical and psychological well-being during the pandemic.","output":"Coping with COVID-19 pandemic: reflections of older couples living alone in urban Odisha, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) has been reported after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The pandemic has demonstrated the potential to evolve and generate a wider range of threats and has opened up essential questions of understanding the security and security organization of states. It is a threat to which, although recognized in most strategic security documents, the response of national and international security systems has not been successfully defined within the still dominant understanding of security based on traditional security studies. It has been shown that security systems are still determined by a traditional concept that does not fully identify the causes of threats and crises and their correlations, which increases uncertainty and negatively affects the normative and institutional capacity needed to respond effectively to crises. The paper is based on the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a security paradigm shift that challenges the scientific community and policy-makers to define new approaches and new methods of researching security phenomena and strategic modelling of security systems and crisis management nationally and globally. The paper will therefore analyse the impact of the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on understanding security through an analysis of the threats it has generated and defining the correlation between theoretical knowledge and practical crisis management experiences.","output":"Pandemija COVID-19 i novo razumijevanje sigurnosti"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared to urban Veterans, rural Veterans are more likely to be older (55-74), not employed, have less education, more service-related disabilities and unmet healthcare needs.

Across the world, a surge of clinical trials trying to cure or slow down the coronavirus pandemic has been launched to bring hope instead of fear and despair. One first proposed clinical trial has drawn worldwide hype to the benefit of chloroquine (CQ), in the treatment of patients infected by the recently emerged deadly coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We should consider this information in light of the long-standing anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties of CQ-related drugs. Yet, none of the articles promoting the use of CQ in the current pandemic evoked a possible molecular or cellular mechanism of action that could account for any efficacy.

The pathological substrate for these findings remains unknown. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface.

Liver fibrosis is the major determinant of long-term outcomes in NAFLD. A non-invasive tool that accurately identifies obese patients at elevated risk of liver fibrosis would be of significant value. Fibrosis risk scores in patients with NAFLD have been proposed but have not been validated in obese populations. We aimed to validate established simple fibrosis scores in bariatric surgical patients. METHODS We conducted a prospective study of 107 consecutive high-risk obese patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery. Proposed fibrosis scores (NAFLD fibrosis score; body mass index (BMI), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase ratio (ALT), and diabetes (BARD); Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4); Forn; and AST to platelet ratio index) were calculated and compared hepatic fibrosis determined by histology of intraoperative liver biopsies. Accuracy was determined, and fibrosis score thresholds were optimized. These modified thresholds were then validated in an independent bariatric surgical population. RESULTS Liver biopsies were available in 101 patients. Sixty-eight patients had some degree of fibrosis, with 23 patients (23 %) having significant fibrosis (F2-4). The Forn score best predicted significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.724, p = 0.001). With standard thresholds, the sensitivity for the Forn score for identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4) was 0 %. Using modified thresholds of 3.5, the sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 85.7 and 94.7 %. This threshold was applied to an independent validation cohort with good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Fibrosis risk scores using simple markers have moderate success at delineating obese patients with significant NAFLD-related fibrosis.

Golgi apparatus of non-growing cells exhibited both larger numbers of vesicles and larger dictyosomes at all temperatures. In non-growing cells, vesicle numbers also were increased at 16C. The 16C block was reconstituted in a cell-free system using Golgi apparatus-and endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions prepared from suspension cultures.

This framework can be iterated upon through the use of design-based research to continue to develop further interventions as needed. Design/methodology/approach Using design-based research methods, in this paper, the authors develop a theoretical framework for addressing COVID-19 misinformation. Using a heuristic analysis of research on vaccine misinformation and hesitancy, the authors propose a framework for education interventions that use the narrative effect of transportation as a means to increase knowledge of the drivers of misinformation online. Findings This heuristic analysis determined that a key element of narrative transportation includes orientation towards particular audiences. Research indicates that mothers are the most significant household decision-makers with respect to vaccines and family health in general;the authors suggest narrative interventions should be tailored specifically to meet their interests and tastes, and that this may be different for mothers of different backgrounds and cultural communities. Originality/value While there is a significant body of literature on vaccine hesitancy and vaccine misinformation, more research is needed that helps people understand the ways in which misinformation works upon social media users.

We studied: 1) association of symptoms with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results; and 2) association of initial RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in relation to duration of RT-PCR positivity in outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cohort study of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and at least one symptom. Participants had repeat nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom checklists every 3C5 days until two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative. RT-PCR tests were used to assess viral load. Antibody tests for COVID-19 were performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (nine females) were enrolled, ranging in age from 19C58 (median age 28 years). All patients reported at least one symptom, with a median of six symptoms per patient. Symptoms persisted for 6C67 days (median duration 18 days). In all 25 patients, blood samples collected a median of 13 days after symptom onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15 (60%). After a median of 28 days following symptom onset, 23/23 patients with available samples tested positive for antibodies. The longest duration of positive RT-PCR test was 49 days from first positive PCR test (Mean = 27.4, SD = 12.5, Median = 24). Initial Ct was significantly associated with longer duration ( = -1.3, SE = 0.3, p<0.01 per 1 cycle higher) of RT-PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS: In mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 outpatients, RT-PCT tests remained positive for as long as 49 days and test positivity and symptom duration correlated with initial viral load.","output":"Clinical characteristics and viral load dynamics of COVID-19 in a mildly or moderately symptomatic outpatient sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Limited English proficiency (LEP) is common among hospitalized patients and may impact care. We synthesized the literature comparing clinical outcomes after in-hospital care for English-proficient(EP) versus LEP patients. METHODS This systematic review searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from database inception through June 7, 2020, to identify research investigating clinical outcomes in patients receiving hospital-based care (in the emergency department, inpatient ward, surgical/procedural suite, or intensive care unit) that compared patients with LEP to an EP group. We assessed mortality, length of stay (LOS), readmissions/revisits, and complications. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS Twenty-six studies met eligibility criteria. Study settings and populations were heterogeneous. Determination of primary language varied; a majority of studies (16/26) used patient self-report directly or via hospital records. Of 16 studies examining LEP and all-cause mortality, 13 found no significant association. Of 17 studies measuring LOS, 9 found no difference, 4 found longer LOS, 3 found shorter LOS, and 1 had mixed LOS results among patients with LEP. Several investigations suggested that LOS differences may be mediated at the hospital level. Nine studies evaluated inpatient readmissions. Among patients with LEP, there was evidence for increased readmissions in the setting of chronic medical conditions such as heart failure, but no evidence for increased readmissions among cohorts undergoing surgeries/procedures or with acute medical conditions. Five studies evaluated complications or harm related to a hospitalization, and no differences were found between language groups. DISCUSSION The research community lacks a standardized definition of LEP. Most studies did not find an association between English proficiency and mortality or complications. LOS findings were mixed and may be influenced at the hospital level. Differences in readmissions by language were concentrated in chronic medical conditions. Given the paucity of studies examining LEP populations, additional research is imperative.

For in-depth evaluation of liver functions during severe heat stress, hepatic transcriptome and proteome were analysed by microarray and two dimensional gel electrophoresis respectively. Results revealed major alterations in redox status, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis related pathways. Data of molecular pathway analysis demonstrate that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) mediated oxidative stress response and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) regulated inflammatory pathways were upregulated in severe heat stressed liver. Expression levels of downstream molecules of above pathways such as heat shock protein 90AB 1, peroxiredoxin 5, Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2, heme-oxygenase 1, apolipoprotein 1 and interleukin 10 were examined and result suggested the upregulation of these genes modulates the NRF-2 and MIF regulated pathways in heat stressed liver. Irregularity in molecular signalling networks lead to mitochondrial dysfunction indicated by upregulation of ATP synthase  and peroxiredoxin 1 along with decreased levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and enhanced activity of cytochrome c in liver mitochondria.

Phase I/II vaccine clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent sera have all shown promise. However, these efforts often require extensive screening with the live virus under onerous high biocontainment conditions (BSL-3). Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) remain the gold standard for evaluating the anti-viral potency of antibodies and entry inhibitors. The proliferation of pseudotyped virus systems that can be used in BSL-2 compatible VNAs is a positive development. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how the findings are presented, making inter-group comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using VSVG based CoV-2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) that can be robustly produced at scale. We used our CoV2pp to interrogate the role of exogenous and endogenous proteases in CoV-2-S mediated entry and standardized our VNA based on that understanding. Our CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S ELISA and live virus neutralizations in a validated set of patient sera. Our system was subsequently validated by three independent groups as an out-of-the-box VNA.

Nevertheless, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of porcine circovirus (PCV) genome in the process of its evolution is available. In this study, to give a new understanding on the evolutionary characteristics of PCV and the effects of natural selection from its host on the codon usage pattern of the virus, Patterns and the key determinants of codon usage in PCV were examined. METHODS: We carried out comprehensive analysis on codon usage pattern in the PCV genome, by calculating relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), dinucleotides and nucleic acid content of the PCV genome. RESULTS: PCV genomes have relatively much lower content of GC and codon preference, this result shows that nucleotide constraints have a major impact on its synonymous codon usage. The results of the correspondence analysis indicate codon usage patterns of PCV of various genotypes, various subgenotypes changed greatly, and significant differences in codon usage patterns of Each virus of Circoviridae.There is much comparability between PCV and its host in their synonymous codon usage, suggesting that the natural selection pressure from the host factor also affect the codon usage patterns of PCV. In particular, PCV genotype II is in synonymous codon usage more similar to pig than to PCV genotype I, which may be one of the most important molecular mechanisms of PCV genotype II to cause disease. The calculations results of the relative abundance of dinucleotides indicate that the composition of dinucleotides also plays a key role in the variation found in synonymous codon usage in PCV. Furthermore, geographic factors, the general average hydrophobicity and the aromaticity may be related to the formation of codon usage patterns of PCV. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies suggest that synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV genome are the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection from its host. The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding the characteristics of synonymous codon usage in PCV genomes, but also have significant value for the molecular evolution of PCV.","output":"Patterns and influencing factor of synonymous codon usage in porcine circovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Propolis, also known as bee-glue, is a resinous substance produced by honeybees from materials collected from plants they visit.

We have earlier reported that CAPE and ARC possess anticancer activities, mediated by abrogation of mortalin-p53 complex and reactivation of p53 tumor suppressor function. Like CAPE, Artepillin C (ARC) and the supercritical extract of green propolis (GPSE) showed potent anticancer activity. In this study, we recruited low doses of GPSE and ARC (that did not affect either cancer cell proliferation or migration) to investigate their antistress potential using in vitro cell based assays. We report that both GPSE and ARC have the capability to disaggregate metal- and heat-induced aggregated proteins. Metal-induced aggregation of GFP was reduced by fourfold in GPSE- as well as ARC-treated cells. Similarly, whereas heat-induced misfolding of luciferase protein showed 80% loss of activity, the cells treated with either GPSE or ARC showed 60C80% recovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate their pro-hypoxia (marked by the upregulation of HIF-1) and neuro-differentiation (marked by differentiation morphology and upregulation of expression of GFAP, -tubulin III, and MAP2).

Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses.

As a result, functional foods have gained significant research attention in the food health and technology innovations field. To date, many studies have investigated the factors that may predict consumer acceptance of functional foods, and a wide range of influential factors have been reported. However, studies conducted in different contexts pose challenges to gaining a clear understanding of the factors influencing consumer acceptance. Therefore, the purpose of our scoping review was to synthesize the possible determinants of consumer acceptance toward functional foods and provide a resource that describes global trends regarding consumers' functional foods behavior. We identified 75 articles published with varying populations around the globe that empirically investigated consumers' acceptance of functional foods. We identified and categorized a wide range of determinants related to consumer acceptance of different types of functional foods. The five categories of determinants were product characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, psychological characteristics, behavioral characteristics, and physical characteristics. Each of the determinants were more fully described by sub-determinants in our scoping review.

Participant observation also used for data collection. Fear of infection, even death and uncertainty haunted both teachers and students lead to the half-hearted motivation to study. Majority of the faculties felt awkward to teach through online method as they are new to it. During teaching there were many problems faced like insufficient data consumption power by many students, lack of required smart phone, frequent network failure. Majority of students are generally spoon fed by their private tutors. Participants supported the physical classes could not give the feasible suggestion to maintain social distance and personal protection in campus and public transport system. Some told about the herd immunity also. Some firmly supported online mode of teaching as the only safe way to teach now. Teaching-learning from home is cost efficient (direct and indirect cost), time efficient, space efficient, surveillance efficient. It has time flexibility. It also has productivity efficiency as less physical movement perhaps increases intellectual productivity. More quality time spending with the family increases happiness index. Even after the pandemic situation this online mode of education will be best suited for the holistic development of society. Single online platform should be used countrywide and teachers and students should adopt slowly to the new system for the sake of safety of majority of people. Government should subsidize data for academic websites, provide cheap smart phones to the students, focus on infrastructure of internet network. Students can be motivated through one to one telephonic conversation also. Only laboratory-based classes can be taken physically fragmenting the entire class into suitable sections.

Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CLpro, CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (&#916;Gbind) in the range of -5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to -26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6).

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43,103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD=14.3); 93.0% (n=40,081) of patients were < 65 years old and 61.9% (n=26,688) were women. Of these 43,103 patients, 67.5% (n=29,104) completed a medical questionnaire on comorbidities and symptoms. The main reported comorbidities were asthma (12.8%; n=3,685), hypertension (12.3%; n=3,546) and diabetes (4.8%; n=1,385).

Novi Sad, as the capital of Vojvodina Province (Republic of Serbia), region with the lowest percentage of forests, needs to provide enough UGS for healthy living. The best example for this goal is one of the greenest urban areas- Brussels with 79.00km2 of UGS. The results showed that City of Novi Sad has 39.02km2 of UGS, while lowest percentage of green areas is found in the city center core, and highest in family-oriented city blocks, which is characteristic even for green cities such as Brussels. Although the distribution and positioning of UGS in Novi Sad is well planned, additional actions for improvement of the amount, quality accessibility is needed, which is supported by the City Council for green spaces of Novi Sad.

We show that the time evolution of $P_{\\\\rm L}(k)$ in models with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters can be mapped from one to the other by relabelling the redshifts that correspond to the same values of $\\\\sigma_{12}(z)$, defined as the RMS linear variance in spheres of radius $12\\\\,{\\\\rm Mpc}$. We use N-body simulations to show that the same evolution mapping relation can be applied to the non-linear power spectrum, the halo mass function, or the full density field with high accuracy. The deviations from the exact degeneracy are the result of the different structure formation histories experienced by each model to reach the same value of $\\\\sigma_{12}(z)$. This relation can be used to drastically reduce the number of parameters required to describe the cosmology dependence of the power spectrum. We show how this degeneracy can be exploited to speed up the inference of parameter constraints from cosmological observations.

Our study was designed to determine the effect of metformin on the cell autophagy and autophagic flux via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: MHCC97H and HepG2 cell lines were cultured and treated without and with metformin at various concentrations (2, 5, 10 and 20 mM) for 48 h. Then, 10 mM was determined as the optimal concentration and the HCC cells were treated with metformin for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h.

Results: Metformin inhibited significantly the viability of MHCC97H and HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. For the apoptotic properties, activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were not observed after treatment with metformin. MHCC97H cells were transfected with a EGFP-LC3 plasmid and treatment with metformin could lead to the increased level of LC3-II and decreased level of p62. In metformin-induced autophagy, AMPK expression was activated, and the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70 S6 Kinase were inhibited.

Methods: Using Bayesian methods, we combined RECOVERY with evidence-based priors incorporating previous COVID-19 tocilizumab RCTs. The probability of tocilizumab's benefit for respiratory support and corticosteroid subgroups and sensitivity analyses were performed with different prior distributions and baseline risks. Results: For all-cause mortality, the posterior probabilities of decreased deaths with tocilizumab were >99% and 19% in patients using and not using corticosteroids, respectively. In patients on simple oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the probabilities of decreased mortality were 96%, >99% and 77%, respectively. The probabilities for a clinically significant mortality reduction, as assessed by an absolute risk difference > 3% (number needed to treat [] 33), were 77%, 96%, 56%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the uncertainty and lack of conclusive evidence for tocilizumab's effect in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation and those without concurrent corticosteroids. Posterior probabilities of benefit for hospital discharge outcome were high and consistent across most subgroups. Conclusions: In this Bayesian reanalysis, COVID-19 hospitalized patients exposed to corticosteroids or on non-invasive ventilation have a high probability of a clinically meaningful mortality benefit from tocilizumab.

This paper reports on responses of zirconia materials with distinct microstructures to nanoindentation associated with diamond machining using a Berkovich diamond indenter. In-situ nanoindentation was performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in-process filmed to record small contact events. Indentation morphology was SEM-mapped at high-magnifications. Although both pre-sintered porous and sintered dense zirconia materials mechanically revealed the quasi-plastic behavior in indentation, there were distinct responses of the two materials to quasi-plasticity at the microstructural level. For pre-sintered porous zirconia, the quasi-plasticity was attributed to shear faults resulting from breaking pore networks as microstructurally discrete interfaces, to lead to compression, fragmentation, pulverization and microcracking of zirconia crystals in indentation imprints. In contrast, sintered dense zirconia had shear band-induced quasi-plastic deformation, accompanied with localized tensile microfracture. A material index associated with the mechanical properties ranked the lower quasi-plasticity for pre-sintered porous zirconia than its sintered dense state, predicting more machining-induced damage in the former than the latter. Significantly higher indentation imprint volumes induced in indented pre-sintered porous zirconia than sintered dense state previses higher machining efficiency for the former than the latter. The microstructure-dependent indentation mechanisms provide the fundamental knowledge into micromechanics of abrasive machining of zirconia materials and may lead to a new microstructural design for zirconia materials to achieve a balanced machining efficiency and damage control.","output":"Microstructural responses of Zirconia materials to in-situ SEM nanoindentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN La poblacin mundial est sufriendo una pandemia por infeccin del virus SARS-Cov-2, que provoca la enfermedad COVID-19.

Results of the literature review indicate the lack of a uniform or universal terminology for two-stage DEA models in the baking industry. Moreover, the main objective of most papers involves extending or improving DEA models. Radial models, with variable returns of scale, and the intermediation approach are the most frequent configurations.

Methods: The pool testing was applied on a set of samples coming from low COVID-19 positivity areas. A total of 2410 samples were tested in pools of five samples each. A total of five pools of five samples each were generated and tested for E gene. Results: Of the total of 482 pools (2410 samples) 24 pools flagged positive. Later on pool de-convolution, a total of 26 samples were detected as positive for COVID-19, leading to positivity of about one per cent in the test population. For the diagnosis of individual samples, the pooling strategies resulted in cost savings of 75 per cent (5 samples per pool).

In contrast, monkey-derived Vero cells are highly susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2, although they are not suitable for the study of antiviral effects by small molecules due to their limited capacity to metabolize drugs compared to human-derived cells. In this study, our goal was to generate a virus-susceptible human cell line that would be useful for the identification and testing of candidate drugs. Towards this end, we stably transfected human lung-derived MRC5 cells with a lentiviral vector encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in MRC5/ACE2 cells. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and progeny virus production were significantly reduced in response to administration of the replication inhibitor, remdesivir, in MRC5/ACE2 cells compared with Vero cells.

Motivated by the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a deep neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images, along with a large curated benchmark dataset comprising 1,489 patient cases as part of the open-source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted data quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used in the study. To address this limitation, in this study we introduce enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images which are trained using a large, diverse, multinational patient cohort. We accomplish this through the introduction of two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest of which comprises a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 16 countries. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest, most diverse multinational cohort for COVID-19 CT images in open-access form. Additionally, we introduce a novel lightweight neural network architecture called COVID-Net CT S, which is significantly smaller and faster than the previously introduced COVID-Net CT architecture. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behavior of the trained models and ensure that decisions are based on relevant indicators, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The best-performing deep neural network in this study achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, positive predictive value, specificity, and negative predictive value of 99.0%/99.1%/98.0%/99.4%/99.7%, respectively. Moreover, explainability-driven performance validation shows consistency with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment.

Human IAVs originate from animal viruses that breached the host species barrier. IAV particles contain sialoglycan receptor\\\\binding hemagglutinin (HA) and receptor\\\\destroying neuraminidase (NA) in their envelope. When IAV crosses the species barrier, the functional balance between HA and NA needs to be adjusted to the sialoglycan repertoire of the novel host species. Relatively little is known about the role of NA in host adaptation in contrast to the extensively studied HA. NA prevents virion aggregation and facilitates release of (newly assembled) virions from cell surfaces and from decoy receptors abundantly present in mucus and cell glycocalyx. In addition to a highly conserved catalytic site, NA carries a second sialic acid\\\\binding site (2SBS). The 2SBS preferentially binds 2,3\\\\linked sialic acids and enhances activity of the neighboring catalytic site by bringing/keeping multivalent substrates in close contact with this site. In this way, the 2SBS contributes to the HA\\\\NA balance of virus particles and affects virus replication. The 2SBS is highly conserved in all NA subtypes of avian IAVs, with some notable exceptions associated with changes in the receptor\\\\binding specificity of HA and host tropism. Conservation of the 2SBS is invariably lost in human (pandemic) viruses and in several other viruses adapted to mammalian host species.

The dose rate of labetalol infusion and use of concurrently administered drugs that could have potentially affected ABP and/or HR were also recorded. ANOVA for repeated measures and Dunnett's multiple comparison test were used to determine the effect of labetalol on ABP and HR. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 20 dogs met the inclusion criteria, and hypertension was documented after craniotomy (12/20), adrenalectomy (4/20) and other procedures (4/20). Five dogs received labetalol intraoperatively, 14 postoperatively, and 1 during the surgical procedure and recovery.

Despite isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing daily: as of June 12th, over 7.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 420,000 global deaths. Over 3.5 million patients have recovered from COVID-19; although this number is increasing by the day, great attention should be directed towards the possible long-term outcomes of the disease. Despite being a trivial matter for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), erectile dysfunction (ED) is a likely consequence of COVID-19 for survivors, and considering the high transmissibility of the infection and the higher contagion rates among elderly men, a worrying phenomenon for a large part of affected patients. METHODS: A literature research on the possible mechanisms involved in the development of ED in COVID-19 survivors was performed. RESULTS: Endothelial dysfunction, subclinical hypogonadism, psychological distress and impaired pulmonary hemodynamics all contribute to the potential onset of ED. Additionally, COVID-19 might exacerbate cardiovascular conditions; therefore, further increasing the risk of ED. Testicular function in COVID-19 patients requires careful investigation for the unclear association with testosterone deficiency and the possible consequences for reproductive health.

While previous investigations have reported that individuals sexual preferences are influenced by a pathogen threat, the empirical support for face preference is mixed (i.e., the association of pathogenic threat and individuals preferences for masculine and/or feminine faces is equivocal). The COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to investigate the association of pathogenic threat and mens and womens preferences for sexual dimorphism of faces in the opposite sex in a real-world pathogenic situation. METHODS: Data were collected during COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) from men and women in the United States, and women in Iran, on preferences for masculinity in mens faces using women participants, and femininity in womens faces using men. RESULTS: Results showed that concern about an actual pathogenic threat (i.e., contracting COVID-19) predicts mens preference for female facial femininity, but not womens preference for male facial masculinity (for both U.S. and Iranian women). CONCLUSION: By using an actual pathogenic threat, our results support previous findings that mens preferences for female faces are shifted to less feminine faces under pathogenic threat.

METHODS We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Selection criteria were defined to identify studies of older age adults exposed to AIH with cognitive measures. 6566 titles were screened. 46 reports were reviewed qualitatively, of which seven contributed data to the MA. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS The qualitative review suggested increased cognitive decline following AIH, but several reports were particularly vulnerable to bias.

METHODS: Clinical data of 60 patients with LC who were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for LC in our hospital from Jan. 2015 to Jan. 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. They underwent CT scanning before and after surgery. The change of arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) was analyzed, and its value in efficacy evaluation was assessed. RESULTS: After surgery, the AEF value of the effective group decreased greatly (P<0.05) and was significantly lower than that of the ineffective group (P<0.05). Alpha fetal protein (AFP) of both groups decreased after surgery, with a significantly lower AFP level in the effective group than that in the ineffective group (P<0.05). AEF and AFP were positively correlated. According to the follow-up results, patients with a low AEF level showed a higher survival rate than those with a high level. Cox regression analysis revealed that AEF was an independent factor for patients' prognosis.

METHODS: The study takes an inductive approach, drawing on the reported experiences of 40 officials at different levels of government across four purposefully selected regions in July 2020. Interviewees were asked about the guidance they received to contain COVID-19, the source of that guidance, their challenges and successes in implementing the guidance, and if and how they adapted the guidance to their particular setting. FINDINGS: The interviews depict considerable challenges, including a lack of supplies and resources; enforcing physical distancing, contact tracing and surveillance; and dealing with fear and stigma. At the same time, they also provide evidence of innovation and adaptation among street-level bureaucrats. Respondents overwhelmingly praise the President, whose limited national response is seen as helpful to reduce fear and stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Other scholars have highlighted the potential dangers of street-level discretion if local officials may \\"make policy\\" in ways that contradict their agencies' stated goals.

Because much has been written about the ethics of vaccine mandates, we examine a related and less discussed topic: the ethics of encouragement strategies aimed at overcoming vaccine reluctance (which can be due to resistance, hesitance, misinformation, or inertia) to facilitate voluntary employee vaccination. While employment-based vaccine encouragement may raise privacy and autonomy concerns, and though some employers might hesitate to encourage employees to get vaccinated, our analysis suggests ethically acceptable ways to inform, encourage, strongly encourage, incentivize, and even subtly pressure employees to get vaccinated.","output":"The ethics of encouraging employees to get the COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is routinely performed in naso/oropharyngeal swabs samples from patients via RT-qPCR.

This article presents a practical method for the assessment of the risk profiles of communities by acquiring, fusing, and analyzing data from public transportation, district population distribution, passenger interactions, and cross-locality travel data while still preserving individual user privacy. The proposed framework fuses these data sources into a realistic simulation of a transit network for a given time span to report on the risk of the public transit system as whole, as well as problematic wards and routes. By shedding credible insights into the impact of public transit on pandemic spread, the article findings will help to set the groundwork for aggregate transmission simulation tools that could provide pandemic response teams with a robust framework for the evaluations of city districts most at risk, and how to adjust municipal services accordingly. ? 1973-2011 IEEE.","output":"Transit Networks, Social Contacts, and Open Data Meet Public Transportation Plans for Post-COVID-19: A Canadian Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expedient translation of research findings into sustainable intervention procedures is a longstanding health care system priority.

Literature review revealed few examples of whether, as originally posited, PCORIs innovative stakeholder-driven approach could catalyze the expedient translation of research results into practice. OBJECTIVES: This narrative review traces the historical development of an American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS/COT) policy guidance, facilitated by evidence supplied by the PCORI-funded studies evaluating the delivery of patient-centered care transitions. Key elements catalyzing the guidance are reviewed, including the sustained engagement of ACS/COT policy stakeholders who have the capacity to invoke system-level implementation strategies, such as regulatory mandates linked to verification site visits. Other key elements, including the encouragement of patient stakeholder voice in policy decisions and the incorporation of end-of-study policy summits in pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial design, are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Informed by comparative effectiveness trials, ACS/COT policy has expedited introduction of the patient-centered care construct into US trauma care systems. A comparative health care systems conceptual framework for transitional care which incorporates Research Lifecycle, pragmatic clinical trial and implementation science models is articulated. When combined with Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE), employed as a targeted implementation strategy, this approach may accelerate the sustainable delivery of high-quality patient-centered care transitions for US trauma care systems.","output":"Catalyzing the Translation of Patient-Centered Research Into United States Trauma Care Systems: A Case Example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La dermatitis atpica (DA) es una enfermedad cutnea crnica que puede desencadenarse debido a situaciones psicolgicas y ciertos alrgenos.

In this study, data on patients with metastatic melanoma from the TCGA and GEO datasets were selected for immune, stromal, and estimate scores, and overlapping differentially expressed genes were screened. A nine-IRGs prognostic model (ALOX5AP, ARHGAP15, CCL8, FCER1G, GBP4, HCK, MMP9, RARRES2 and TRIM22) was established by univariate COX regression, LASSO and multivariate COX regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test the predictive accuracy of the model. Immune infiltration was analyzed by using CIBERSORT and Xcell in high-risk and low-risk groups. The immune infiltration of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. Immune checkpoint analysis revealed that the expression of PDCD1, CTLA4, TIGIT, CD274, HAVR2 and LAG3 demonstrated the visible difference in groups with different levels of risk scores.

The above-mentioned terms were extensively searched on pubmed, google scholar and google search engine and after reviewing the various available material the most significant research has been taken into consideration for this review. CONCLUSION: Through this review we conclude that there are various factors that are responsible for the initiation of sneeze and cough but in case of infection it is mainly the inflammatory reaction that directly stimulates the receptors to produce the reflex outburst of air. As the flow of air during expiration is turbulent it causes damage to the Epithelial Lining Fluid present in the respiratory conduit and also gets admixed with the saliva in the oropharynx and oral cavity and mucus in the nose to form droplets of various sizes. Large droplets Settle close and are responsible for Droplet and Fomite transmission but the smaller droplets remain suspended in air and travel farther distances to cause Airborne transmission.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on waterCairChuman life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities.

As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic agent which have been approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 211 COVID-19 in-patients that were treated between March - August 2020. Confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent high-resolution-CT (HRCT) finding. Radiological images and the rate of clinical response of patients were investigated. Result: While 128 patients (58.7) did not develop pneumonia, the mild, moderate and severe pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%). 72 patients (34.1%) whose PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom and they were followed in isolation without treatment. 52 patients (24.6%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 57 patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients (14.2%) received favipiravir plus dexamethosone as the first line of treatment. 63.1% of pneumonia patients who received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 28.3% of patients who received favipravir and 10% of patients who received favipravir plus dexamethasone showed a failure of treatment. Conclusion: The pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 are not infective; therefore, the characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of pneumonia.

This study examines the prevalence and factors associated with shortages of NH staff during COVID-19 pandemic. Design We obtained self-reported information on staff shortages, resident and staff exposure to COVID-19, and PPE availability from a survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in May 2020. Multivariate logistic regressions of staff shortages with state fixed-effects were conducted to examine the effect of COVID-19 factors in NHs. Setting and participants 11,920 free-standing NHs. Measures The dependent variables were self-reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other ancillary staff. We controlled for NH characteristics from the most recent Nursing Home Compare and Certification And Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, market characteristics from Area Health Resources File, and state Medicaid reimbursement calculated from Truven data. Results Of the 11,920 NHs, 15.9%, 18.4%, 2.5%, and 9.8% reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other staff, respectively. Georgia and Minnesota reported the highest rates of shortages in licensed nurse and nurse aides (both > 25%). Multivariate regressions suggest that shortages in licensed nurses and nurse aides were more likely in NHs having any resident with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.44, 1.60, respectively) and any staff with COVID-19 (AOR = 1.37, 1.34, respectively). Having one-week supply of PPE was associated with lower probability of staff shortages. NHs with a higher proportion of Medicare residents were less likely to experience shortages. Conclusions /Implications: Abundant staff shortages were reported by NHs and were mainly driven by COVID-19 factors. In the absence of appropriate staff, NHs may be unable to fulfill the requirement of infection control even under the risk of increased monetary penalties.","output":"Shortages of Staff in Nursing Homes During COVID-19 Pandemic: What Are the Driving Factors?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a significant burden to healthcare systems, economic crisis, and public fears.

Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 oC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors for Intensive Care Unit Admission of Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Study Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The population of 168 countries all over the world is struggling with the outbreak of COVID-19.

However, the impact of the pandemic and national emergency measures on the number of non-COVID-19 presentations and the assessed acuity of those presentations remain uncertain. METHODS: We acquired a retrospective cohort containing all ED visits in a Finnish secondary care hospital during years 2018, 2019 and 2020. We compared the number of presentations in 2020 during the national state of emergency, i.e. from March 16 to June 11, with numbers from 2018 and 2019. Presentations were stratified using localized New York University Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA) to evaluate changes in presentations with different acuity levels. RESULTS: A total of 27,526 presentations were observed. Compared to previous two years, total daily presentations were reduced by 23% (from 113 to 87, p < .001). In NYU-EDA classes, Non-Emergent visits were reduced the most by 42% (from 18 to 10, p < .001). Emergent presentations were reduced by 19 to 28% depending on the subgroup (p < .001).

Unfolding the critical moments of the COVID-19 outbreak, this article characterizes the evolution of ChinaCEurope relations with regard to the facemask. This simple object of self-protection against the coronavirus strikingly became a source of contention between peoples and states. In the face of this situation, we argue that the facemask is the prism through which to illustrate (1) the transnational links between China and its overseas population, (2) the changing social perceptions of China and Chinese-looking people in European societies, and (3) the advent of Chinas health diplomacy and its reception in Europe. Comparing two European settingsFrance and the United Kingdom (UK)the common denominator appears to be the reduced trust, if not outright distrust, between individuals and communities in the French and British contexts, and in SinoCFrench and SinoCBritish relations at the transnational level. Combining critical juncture theory and (dis)trust in international relations as our analytical framework, this article examines how the facemask became a politicized object, both between states and between Mainland China and its overseas population, as the epidemic unfolded throughout Europe. Adopting a qualitative approach, our dataset comprises the analysis of official speeches and statements;press releases;traditional and social media content (especially through hashtags such as #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus, #IAmNotAVirus, #CoronaRacism, etc.);and interviews with Chinese, French, and British community members.","output":"To Trust or Not to Trust?

One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface (A/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon- and interferon- (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.","output":"Innate immune response of human alveolar type II cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proning awake patients with COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality and intubation rates.

In December 2020, at the peak of the Los Angeles outbreak, our center rapidly implemented a protocol to improve outpatient management and provide Bamlanivimab or Casirivimab-Imdevimab (COVID mAb therapies) to all eligible COVID-19 positive liver and kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: A retrospective review of all abdominal organ transplant recipients who were COVID-19 PCR+ between 2/2020-2/2021 from our center was performed. Patient demographics, COVID-19 treatments, hospitalizations, and survival were reviewed. Patients were considered eligible for COVID mAb therapy if they meet outpatient criteria at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: In the study period, 121 kidney transplant recipients (KG) and 105 liver or combined liver/kidney transplant recipients (LG) were COVID-19 PCR+. Hospitalization rates were similar for the KG (45%) versus LG (35%) (p=.20) but mortality was higher for the KG (22%) when compared to LG (10%) (p=.02). Our programmatic response, including outpatient COVID mAb therapies, reduced hospitalizations (p=.01) and deaths (p=.01). 94 KG and 87 LG patients were identified as potentially eligible for COVID mAb therapy and 17 KG and 17 LG patients were treated. COVID mAb therapies reduced hospitalization from 32% to 15% (p=.045) and eliminated mortality (13% vs 0%, p=.04).

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan has been used to obtain surface area (SA) and volume (Vol.) measurements, while others have used simple mathematical formulas to obtain SA and Vol. estimates without 3D reconstruction. Our objective was to assess the correlation of SA and Vol. measurements and estimates of complex incisional hernias. METHODS We conducted a retrospective agreement study of adults who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction from 2007 to 2018. Demographics, hernia characteristics, and operative data were collected from the medical record. SA and Vol. measurements were obtained after 3D CT reconstruction. Linear CT variables were obtained independently by two surgeons and SA and Vol. estimates were calculated. Because both surgeons reported similar results, only lead author values are reported in the abstract. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) to assess inter-rater agreement and the agreement between SA and Vol. measurements and estimates. RESULTS A total of 108 patients were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 57  11 years and 53 (49%) were female. 42 (39%) hernias were recurrent, 10 (9%) patients had a stoma, and 9 (8%) had a history of open abdomen. The mean defect width was 11  4 cm and mean defect surface area (DSA) was 150  95 cm2. Inter-rater agreement of SA and Vol. estimates was high (r  0.80). There was high correlation between SA and Vol. measurements and estimates for DSA, hernia sac volume (HSV), abdominal cavity volume (ACV), and HSV/ACV ratio (r = 0.81, 0.89, 0.94 and 0.91, respectively).

It has significantly reduced gross domestic product (GDP), power generation, industrial activity and transport volume; thus, it has reduced fossil-related and cement-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China. Due to time delays in obtaining activity data, traditional emissions inventories generally involve a 2C3-year lag. However, a timely assessment of COVID-19's impact on provincial CO2 emission reductions is crucial for accurately understanding the reduction and its implications for mitigation measures; furthermore, this information can provide constraints for modeling studies. Here, we used national and provincial GDP data and the China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs) inventory to estimate the emission reductions in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020. We find a reduction of 257.7 Mt. CO2 (11.0%) over Q1 2019. The secondary industry contributed 186.8 Mt. CO2 (72.5%) to the total reduction, largely due to lower coal consumption and cement production. At the provincial level, Hubei contributed the most to the reductions (40.6 Mt) due to a notable decrease of 48.2% in the secondary industry. Moreover, transportation significantly contributed (65.1 Mt), with a change of ?22.3% in freight transport and ?59.1% in passenger transport compared with Q1 2019. We used a point, line and area sources (PLAS) method to test the GDP method, producing a close estimate (reduction of 10.6%). One policy implication is a change in people's working style and communication methods, realized by working from home and holding teleconferences, to reduce traffic emissions. Moreover, GDP is found to have potential merit in estimating emission changes when detailed energy activity data are unavailable. We provide provincial data that can serve as spatial disaggregation constraints for modeling studies and further support for both the carbon cycle community and policy makers.","output":"Assessing the recent impact of COVID-19 on carbon emissions from China using domestic economic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to examine the effect of e-evaluation on work motivation among teachers during the Movement Control Order (MCO) in COVID-19 and determining the mediating role of stress.Design/methodology/approachThe study is designed using a causal research design to examine the cause-effect relationship between the study variables.

In areas where reduced malaria transmission is being sustained through insecticide-based vector control interventions, primarily long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), non-insecticidal complementary tools will likely be needed to push towards malaria elimination. Once interruption in local disease transmission is achieved, insecticide-based measures can be scaled down gradually and eventually phased out, saving on costs of sustaining control programs and mitigating any unintended negative health and environmental impacts posed by insecticides. These non-insecticidal methods could eventually replace insecticidal methods of vector control. House screening, a non-insecticidal method, has a long history in malaria control, but is still not widely adopted in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aims to add to the evidence base for this intervention in low transmission settings by assessing the efficacy, impact, and feasibility of house screening in areas where LLINs are conventionally used for malaria control. METHODS: A two-armed, household randomized clinical trial will be conducted in Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to evaluate whether combined the use of house screens and LLINs affords better protection against clinical malaria in children between 6 months and 13 years compared to the sole use of LLINs. Eight hundred households will be enrolled in each study area, where 400 households will be randomly assigned the intervention, house screening, and LLINs while the control households will be provided with LLINs only. Clinical malaria incidence will be estimated by actively following up one child from each household for 6 months over the malaria transmission season. Cross-sectional parasite prevalence will be estimated by testing all participating children for malaria parasites at the beginning and end of each transmission season using rapid diagnostic tests. CDC light traps and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) will be used to sample adult mosquitoes and evaluate the impact of house screening on indoor mosquito density, species distribution, and sporozoite rates. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute epidemiological data on the impact of house screening on malaria transmission and assess the feasibility of its implementation on a programmatic scale.

Methods: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecysys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained. Findings:1058 individuals (10.14%) had antibodies against SARS CoV2. A follow up on 346 seropositive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of seropositive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for seropositivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1.79, 1.43 to 2*24, 2.81561x10-6), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2.23, 1.92 to 2.59, 6.43969x10-26), non smokers (1.52, 1.16 to 1.99, 0.02) and non vegetarianism (1.67, 1.41 to 1.99, 3.03821x10-8).

Research has firmly established that vaccine efficacy is an important driver of public vaccine acceptance and choice. However, current vaccines offer widely varying levels of protection against different adverse health outcomes of COVID-19. This study employs an experiment embedded on a survey of 1,194 US adults in June 2021 to examine how communications about vaccine efficacy affect vaccine choice. The experiment manipulated how vaccine efficacy was defined across four treatments: (1) protection against symptomatic infection; (2) protection against severe illness; (3) protection against hospitalization/death; (4) efficacy data on all three metrics. The control group received no efficacy information. Subjects were asked to choose between a pair of vaccinesa one-dose viral vector vaccine or two-dose mRNA vaccinewhose efficacy data varied across the four experimental treatment groups. Efficacy data for each vaccine on each dimension were adapted from clinical trial data on the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Among all respondents, only modest preference gaps between the two vaccines emerged in the control group and when the two vaccines roughly equivalent efficacy data against hospitalization and death were reported. Strong preferences for a two-dose mRNA vaccine emerged in treatments where its higher efficacy against symptomatic or severe illness was reported, as well as in the treatment where data on all three efficacy criteria were reported. Unvaccinated respondents preferred a one-dose viral vector vaccine when only efficacy data against hospitalization or death was presented. Black and Latino respondents were significantly more likely to choose the one-shot viral vector vaccine in the combined efficacy treatment than were whites.

Main outcome measures were no-flow-time, quality metrics as defined by ERC and time intervals to first chest compression, oxygen supply, intubation and first rhythm analysis. Data were presented as meanstandard deviation. RESULTS: Thirty resuscitation scenarios were completed. No-flow-time was markedly prolonged in COVID-19-minimal-personnel [11337sec] compared to Control [559sec] and COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager [7638sec](p<0.001 each). In both COVID-19-groups chest compressions started later [COVID-19-minimal-personnel:326sec; COVID-19-advancedairway-manager:377sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (215sec)], but oxygen supply [COVID-19-minimal-personnel:295sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:347sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (7719sec)] and first intubation attempt [COVID-19-minimalpersonnel: 11114sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:13120sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (17844sec)] were performed earlier. However, time interval to successful intubation was similar [Control:19848sec; COVID-19-minimal-personnel:18142sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:13025sec] due to a longer intubation time in COVID-19-minimalpersonnel [6135sec] compared to COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager (p=0.002) and control [196sec;p<0.001].

Data for effectiveness of different testing practices for pharyngeal C trachomatis are scarce. We therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of pharyngeal C trachomatis, determinants, and effectiveness of different testing practices in women. METHODS We did a retrospective cohort study, in which surveillance data for all women visiting sexually transmitted infection clinics in all regions in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017, were used. We collected consultation-level data and individual-level data from 2016 onwards for sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour in the past 6 months, self-reported symptoms, and STI diagnoses. The primary outcome was the positivity rate of pharyngeal C trachomatis infection compared between routine universal testing (>85% tested pharyngeally per clinic year), selective testing (5-85% tested pharyngeally per clinic year), and incidental testing (<5% pharyngeally tested per clinic year). We calculated the number of missed infections by extrapolating the positivity rate assessed by routine universal testing to all selectively tested women. We used multivariable generalised estimating equations logistic regression analyses to assess independent risk factors for pharyngeal C trachomatis and used the assessed risk factors as testing indicators for comparing alternative testing scenarios. FINDINGS Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017, a total of 550 615 consultations with at least one C trachomatis test was recorded, of which 541 945 (984%) consultations (including repeat visits) were included in this analysis. Pharyngeal C trachomatis positivity was lower in the routine universal testing group than in the selective testing group (1081 [24%; 95% CI 22-25] of 45 774 vs 3473 [29%; 28-30] of 121 262; p<00001). The positivity rate was also higher among consultations done in the incidental testing group (44 [41%; 95% CI 31-55] of 1073; p<00001) than in the routine universal testing group. Based on extrapolation, selective testing would have hypothetically missed 644% (95% CI 635-653; 6363 of 9879) of the estimated total of C trachomatis infections. The proportion of pharyngeal-only C trachomatis was comparable between routinely universally tested women (229%) and selectively tested women (204%), resulting in a difference of 25% (95% CI -03 to 53; p=007). When using risk factors for pharyngeal C trachomatis as testing indicators, 15 484 (796%) of 19 459 women would be tested to detect 398 (806%) of 494 infections. INTERPRETATION No optimal testing scenario was available for pharyngeal C trachomatis, in which only a selection of high-risk women needs to be tested to find most pharyngeal C trachomatis infections. The relative low prevalence of pharyngeal-only C trachomatis (05%) and probably limited clinical and public health effect do not provide support for routine universal testing.

Additionally, 5/405 (1.2%) eyes in the persistent group and 8/161 (5.0%) eyes in the nonpersistent group developed an end-stage disease with a subfoveal fibrosis during the observational period (p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: We found that eyes with nAMD that were nonpersistent to intravitreal aflibercept therapy experienced statistically significantly worse VA compared to eyes persistent to therapy within 3 years. Moreover, eyes in the nonpersistent group had a four-fold higher risk of developing a fovea-involving fibrosis. Considering the potential irreversible deterioration with respect to best-corrected VA within nAMD, strategies need to be developed for patients at risk of nonpersistence to therapy.","output":"Intravitreal Aflibercept Therapy and Treatment Outcomes of Eyes with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in a Real-Life Setting: A Five-Year Follow-Up Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis), cyclophilins play a vital role in dislodging Myb proteins from the membrane compartment and leading them to nuclear translocation. We previously reported that TvCyP1 cyclophilin from T. vaginalis forms a dimer and plays an essential role in moving the Myb1 transcription factor toward the nucleus. In comparison, TvCyP2 containing an extended segment at the N-terminus (N-terminal segment) formed a monomer and showed a different role in regulating protein trafficking. Four X-ray structures of TvCyP2 were determined under various conditions, all showing the N-terminal segment interacting with the active site of a neighboring TvCyP2, an unusual interaction. NMR study revealed that this particular interaction exists in solution as well and also the N-terminal segment seems to interact with the membrane. In vivo study of TvCyP2 and TvCyP2-?N (TvCyP2 without the N-terminal segment) indicated that both proteins have different subcellular localization. Together, the structural and functional characteristics at the N-terminal segment offer valuable information for insights into the mechanism of how TvCyP2 regulates protein trafficking, which may be applied in drug development to prevent pathogenesis and disease progression in T. vaginalis infection.","output":"N-Terminal Segment of TvCyP2 Cyclophilin from Trichomonas vaginalis Is Involved in Self-Association, Membrane Interaction, and Subcellular Localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the severity and suicide risk of patients typically treated by Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and the absence of guidelines regarding delivery of DBT via telehealth, it is crucial that the DBT treatment community gather and rapidly disseminate information about effective strategies for delivering DBT via telehealth.

The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing during the ongoing pandemic in Sweden. METHOD: Standardized measures of depression, anxiety, and insomnia as well as measures of risk and vulnerability factors known to be associated with poor mental health outcomes were administered through a national, online, cross-sectional survey (n = 1,212; mean age 36.1 years; 73% women). RESULT: Our findings show significant levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in Sweden, at rates of 30%, 24.2%, and 38%, respectively. The strongest predictors of these outcomes included poor self-rated overall health and a history of mental health problems. The presence of COVID-19 symptoms and specific health and financial worries related to the pandemic also appeared important. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of COVID-19 on mental health in Sweden are comparable to impacts shown in previous studies in Italy and China. Importantly, the pandemic seems to impose most on the mental health of those already burdened with the impacts of mental health problems.

This repeated cross-sectional study used data from the national WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study-2 collected from low-income mother/caregivers about infants from around birth through age 5 (60 months; n = 3773). Survey-weighted adjusted regression models assessed associations between breastfeeding and vegetable introduction measures with vegetable consumption at child ages 13, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Longer breastfeeding duration was associated with a slightly, but significantly, greater variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. There was also a small but positive statistically significant association between the number of different types of vegetables consumed on a given day at 9 months and the amount and variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. Age of initial vegetables introduction and whether vegetables were the first/second food introduced were not consistently related to the amount or variety of vegetables consumed later in childhood. Longer breastfeeding and introduction to a greater variety of vegetables at 9 months may be behaviors to target to increase consumption of a greater variety of vegetables by young children.","output":"The Relationship between Breastfeeding and Initial Vegetable Introduction with Vegetable Consumption in a National Cohort of Children Ages 1C5 Years from Low-Income Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organ transplantation, including of the heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, and small bowel, is considered the therapy of choice for end-stage organ failure. Each year, over 70,000 organs are implanted worldwide. One donor may provide multiple organs, as well as corneas and other tissues, for multiple recipients. The degree of risk for transmission of infection carried with grafts, notably of viruses, is largely unknown and, for a specific organ, difficult to assess. The approach to microbiological screening of organ donors varies with national and regional regulations and with the availability and performance of microbiological assays used for potential donors. Transmission of both expected or common, and unexpected infections has been observed in organ transplants, generally recognized after development of clusters of infections among recipients of organs from a common donor. Other than for unusual or catastrophic events, few data exist that define the incidence and manifestations of donor-derived infections or the ideal assays to use in screening to prevent such transmissions. Absolute prevention of the transmission of donor-derived infections in organ transplantation is not possible.

Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner.

A concept analysis was conducted using the Walker and Avant method to identify the attributes defining the nurse-patient relationship. An integrative review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature databases. A review of the grey literature and other minor non-indexed publications on the topic was also conducted. A total of 36 articles were included in the review. A model case, a contrary case, a related case, and empirical references were produced to clarify the concept and identify its essential attributes. The concept is defined as a helping relationship involving interaction between different players. It is the basis of nursing care and is intended to meet the healthcare needs of the individual receiving this care. It is also viewed as an intervention in itself, requiring a specific training process just like any other nursing skill. The essential attributes of the relationship are empathy, presence, contact, authenticity, trust, and reciprocity. In conclusion, the nurse-patient relationship is a helping relationship established with the patient and/or their family based on interaction, communication, respect for ethical values, acceptance, and empathy in order to encourage introspection and behavioural change.

However, many studies do not consider the age dependency of comorbidities, which influence the course of disease. Protection strategies often target individuals after a certain age, which may not necessarily be evidence based. The aim of this review was to quantify the isolated effect of age on hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death. METHODS: This review was based on an umbrella review, in which Pubmed, Embase and preprint databases were searched on 10 December 2020, for relevant reviews on COVID-19 disease severity. Two independent reviewers evaluated the primary studies using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results were extracted, and each study was assessed for risk of bias. The isolated effect of age was estimated by meta-analysis, and the quality of evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. RESULTS: Seventy studies met our inclusion criteria (case mortality: n=14, in-hospital mortality: n=44, hospitalisation: n=16, admission to ICU: n=12, mechanical ventilation: n=7). The risk of in-hospital and case mortality increased per age year by 5.7% and 7.4%, respectively (effect size (ES) in-hospital mortality=1.057, 95% CI 1.038 to 1.054; ES case mortality=1.074, 95% CI 1.061 to 1.087), while the risk of hospitalisation increased by 3.4% per age year (ES=1.034, 95% CI 1.021 to 1.048). No increased risk was observed for ICU admission and intubation by age year. There was no evidence of a specific age threshold at which the risk accelerates considerably. The confidence of evidence was high for mortality and hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a best-possible quantification of the increase in COVID-19 disease severity due to age. Rather than implementing age thresholds, prevention programmes should consider the continuous increase in risk. There is a need for continuous, high-quality research and living reviews to evaluate the evidence throughout the pandemic, as results may change due to varying circumstances.","output":"The isolated effect of age on the risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes: a systematic review with meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the end stage of various chronic and progressive interstitial lung diseases.

However, the pharmacological mechanisms of WBT against PF need to be further explored. In this study, we first analyzed the chemical components of the WBT formula using the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis. The potential targets of the identified compounds from WBT were predicted by the network pharmacology, which was confirmed by in vivo and in vitro study. After screening by the PubChem database, we first identified the 36 compounds of WBT and predicted the TGF- signaling pathway, with ECM degradation as potential mechanism of WBT against PF by the network pharmacology. Furthermore, WBT treatment inhibited the levels of TGF- and Smad3 phosphorylation and subsequently alleviated EMT and ECM accumulation in the bleomycin-induced mouse model and TGF-1Cinduced cell model. These findings indicate that WBT can block the progressive process of PF by inhibiting EMT and promoting ECM degradation via the TGF-/Smad3 pathway.

We aimed to evaluate the role of school reopening and the preventive strategies in place at schools in terms of overall risk for children and community transmission, by comparing transmission rates in children as detected by a COVID-19 surveillance platform in place in Catalonian Schools to the incidence at the community level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Infections detected in Catalan schools during the entire first trimester of classes (September-December 2020) were analysed and compared with the ongoing community transmission and with the modelled predicted number of infections. There were 30.486 infections (2.12%) documented among the circa 1.5M pupils, with cases detected in 54.0% and 97.5% of the primary and secondary centres, respectively. During the entire first term, the proportion of bubble groups (stable groups of children doing activities together) that were forced to undergo confinement ranged between 1 and 5%, with scarce evidence of substantial intraschool transmission in the form of chains of infections, and with ~75% of all detected infections not leading to secondary cases. Mathematical models were also used to evaluate the effect of different parameters related to the defined preventive strategies (size of the bubble group, number of days of confinement required by contacts of an index case). The effective reproduction number inside the bubble groups in schools (R*), defined as the average number of schoolmates infected by each primary case within the bubble, was calculated, yielding a value of 0.35 for primary schools and 0.55 for secondary schools, and compared with the outcomes of the mathematical model, implying decreased transmissibility for children in the context of the applied measures. Relative homogenized monthly cumulative incidence ([Image: see text] ) was assessed to compare the epidemiological dynamics among different age groups and this analysis suggested the limited impact of infections in school-aged children in the context of the overall community incidence. CONCLUSIONS: During the fall of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases detected in Catalan schools closely mirrored the underlying community transmission from the neighbourhoods where they were set and maintaining schools open appeared to be safe irrespective of underlying community transmission. Preventive measures in place in those schools appeared to be working for the early detection and rapid containment of transmission and should be maintained for the adequate and safe functioning of normal academic and face-to-face school activities.","output":"Individual prevention and containment measures in schools in Catalonia, Spain, and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after school re-opening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smooth muscles are a specific muscle subtype that is widely identified in the tissues of internal passageways.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, which caused the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, involves airway smooth muscles and their surrounding inflammatory environment. Therefore, airway smooth muscles and related inflammatory factors may play an irreplaceable role in the initiation and progression of several severe diseases.

Here, on the basis of newly presented machine learning-based computational approaches, we identified specific regulatory factors and a series of rules that contribute to the activation and stimulation of airway smooth muscles by IL-13, IL-17, or the combination of both interleukins on the epigenetic and/or transcriptional levels. The detected discriminative factors (genes) and rules can contribute to the identification of potential regulatory mechanisms linking airway smooth muscle tissues and inflammatory factors and help reveal specific pathological factors for diseases associated with airway smooth muscle inflammation on multiomics levels.","output":"Detecting the Multiomics Signatures of Factor-Specific Inflammatory Effects on Airway Smooth Muscles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"&lt;italic&gt;Pimpinella&lt;/italic&gt; plants have traditionally been used to treat many diseases related to respiratory system and have analgesic, antidepressant, and antispasmodic effects.

This may help to optimize clinical workflow and more efficiently allocate scarce medical resources. To this end, medical imaging shows great potential and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to assist in diagnosing and risk stratifying COVID-19 patients.

This leads to the occurrence of extreme habitats to which species must adapt. This challenge becomes crucial for species living in unstable environments, such as the riparian earthworm Eiseniella tetraedra. Its cosmopolitan distribution exposes it to various environmental changes, such as freezing in subarctic regions or droughts in Mediterranean areas. Transcriptional changes under cold and desiccation conditions could therefore shed light on the adaptive mechanisms of this species. An experiment was performed for each condition. In the cold experiment, the temperature was lowered to -14a?Ca?a?2a?C (compared to 8a?C for control samples), and in the desiccation treatment, humidity was lowered from 60% to 15%. Comparisons of gene expression levels between earthworms under freezing conditions and control earthworms revealed a total of 84 differentially expressed genes and comparisons between the desiccation experiment and the control yielded 163 differentially expressed genes. However, no common responses were found between the two treatments. The results suggest that E. tetraedra can acclimate to low temperatures due to the upregulation of genes involved in glucose accumulation. However, downregulation of the respiratory chain suggests that this earthworm does not tolerate freezing conditions. Under desiccation conditions, genes involved in cell protection from apoptosis and DNA repair were upregulated.

RESULTS The TOCC resulted in a 19.2% relative reduction in 30-day readmission rates in the 12-month postimplementation period compared to the preimplementation period (9.2% vs 11.4%, P = .04). Virtual visits were more popular than in-person visits among both urban and rural veterans. There was no difference in outcomes between these two follow-up options, and both groups had reduced readmission rates compared to non-TOCC follow-up. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary TOCC within the ICVA featuring both virtual and in-person visits reduced the 30-day readmission rate. This reduction was particularly notable among patients with congestive heart failure.","output":"An Initiative to Improve 30-Day Readmission Rates Using a Transitions-of-Care Clinic Among a Mixed Urban and Rural Veteran Population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entry of wild-type lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) into cells requires a low-pH step. This low-pH constraint implicates endocytosis in EIAV entry. To identify the endocytic pathway involved in EIAV entry, we examined the entry requirements for EIAV into two different cells: equine dermal (ED) cells and primary equine endothelial cells. We investigated the entry mechanism of several strains of EIAV and found that both macrophage-tropic and tissue culture-adapted strains utilize clathrin-coated pits for entry. In contrast, a superinfecting strain of EIAV, EIAV(vMA-1c), utilizes two mechanisms of entry. In cells such as ED cells that EIAV(vMA-1c) is able to superinfect, viral entry is pH independent and appears to be mediated by plasma membrane fusion, whereas in cells where no detectable superinfection occurs, EIAV(vMA-1c) entry that is low-pH dependent occurs through clathrin-coated pits in a manner similar to wild-type virus. Regardless of the mechanism of entry being utilized, the internalization kinetics of EIAV is rapid with 50% of cell-associated virions internalizing within 60 to 90 min. Cathepsin inhibitors did not prevent EIAV entry, suggesting that the low-pH step required by wild-type EIAV is not required to activate cellular cathepsins.","output":"Equine infectious anemia virus entry occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Favipiravir is a potential antiviral medication that has been recently licensed for Covid-19 treatment. In this work, a gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid was prepared and used as an extractant in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) of favipiravir in human plasma. The high enriching ability of DLLME allowed the determination of favipiravir in real samples using HPLC/UV with sufficient sensitivity. The effects of several variables on extraction efficiency were investigated, including type of extractant, amount of extractant, type of disperser and disperser volume. The maximum enrichment was attained using 50 mg of the Gd-magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) and 150 l of tetrahydrofuran. The Gd-based MIL could form a supramolecular assembly in the presence of tetrahydrofuran, which enhanced the extraction efficiency of favipiravir.

Many game theoretic models explore this scenario, but these models tend to assume either best response dynamics (where individuals instantly switch to better paying strategies) or imitation dynamics (where individuals copy successful strategies from neighbours), and do not systematically compare predictions under the two assumptions. Here we propose an iterated game on a social network with payoff functions that depend on the state of the resource. Agents harvest the resource, and the strategy composition of the population evolves until an equilibrium is reached. The system is then repeatedly perturbed and allowed to re-equilibrate. We compare model predictions under best response and imitation dynamics. Compared to imitation dynamics, best response dynamics increase sustainability of the system, the persistence of cooperation while decreasing inequality and debt corresponding to the Gini index in the agents' cumulative payoffs. Additionally, for best response dynamics, the number of strategy switches before equilibrium fits a power-law distribution under a subset of the parameter space, suggesting the system is in a state of self-organized criticality. We find little variation in most mean results over different network topologies; however, there is significant variation in the distributions of the raw data, equality of payoff, clustering of like strategies and power-law fit. We suggest the primary mechanisms driving the difference in sustainability between the two strategy update rules to be the clustering of like strategies as well as the time delay imposed by an imitation processes. Given the strikingly different outcomes for best response versus imitation dynamics for common-pool resource systems, our results suggest that modellers should choose strategy update rules that best represent decision-making in their study systems.","output":"Best response dynamics improve sustainability and equity outcomes in common-pool resources problems, compared to imitation dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Screening tools developed for Western populations have produced heterogeneous prevalence estimates for depression and anxiety disorders among refugees.

Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire regarding depressive and anxiety symptoms in either Arabic or German. Measurement invariance was only present to a certain extent. Questionnaires were most informative on different spectrums of the latent traits for the two groups. Network analysis demonstrated that symptom interrelations of depressive and anxiety symptoms differed across residents and refugees. This was especially true for core symptoms of common nosological systems, such as losing interest or feeling depressed. Surprisingly, traumatic events in the past were not central in refugees' anxiety networks.

To contain this highly contagious and potentially deadly disease, the French government decided an unprecedented nationwide lockdown. We investigated in a large cohort of cancer patients from Hauts-de-France, the third French region most stricken by COVID-19, the frequency of symptoms, how cancer navigated the health care system during these very difficult circumstances, and their feelings. Method(s): We made a flash survey among 6900 patients treated at our cancer center within March 2019 and March 2020. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web-based survey sent on April 30 and closed on May 14. Result(s): We received reports from 2224 cancer patients. Mean age was 63 years, 72% were women, only 9% were smokers, 26% had hypertension, 9% diabetes, and 5% asthma. The most represented cancers were breast (45%), gynecologic cancers (12%), digestive (8%), and head and neck cancer (6%). Most patients were in follow up, 13% were receiving chemotherapy. The majority did not develop symptoms associated with COVID during the COVID wave;one third experienced symptoms. The main symptoms reported were headache (38%), myalgia and arthralgia (31%), cough (25%), digestive signs (20%), intense fatigue (19%), or fever (13%). Among patients with symptoms, 58% did not seek medical advice during the COVID wave and 95% of them were not tested. For those receiving chemotherapy, 80% had their treatment as planned. Among patients with a planned surgery, 30% of them were delayed. 32% of the patients reported anxiety, 35% felt unsecure and 16% reported an increased consumption of antistress medication, tobacco or alcohol. We also discuss the pattern of symptoms and feelings according to the cancer type and the treatment received. Conclusion(s): This study showed that most of our cancer patients were probably not infected during the COVID wave, which highlights the need to maintain barrier measures to protect them and perform validated tests.

However, the spectrum of abnormalities associated with CIC has been highly variable. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature (until 1 June 2020) to assess CIC and disease severity during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were pooled mean differences in platelet count, D-dimer level, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen level between non-severe and severe patients, stratified by degree of hypoxaemia or those who died. The risk factors for CIC were analysed. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed using R version 3.6.1, and certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Of the included 5,243 adult COVID-19 patients, patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly lower platelet count, and higher D-dimer level, prothrombin time and fibrinogen level than non-severe patients. Pooled mean differences in platelet count (-19.7109/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -31.7 to -7.6), D-dimer level (0.8g/mL, 95% CI 0.5-1.1), prothrombin time (0.4 second, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and fibrinogen level (0.6g/L, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) were significant between the groups. Platelet count and D-dimer level were significant predictors of disease severity on meta-regression analysis. Older men had higher risks of severe coagulopathic disease.

However, little is known about the relationship between coinfection with tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to compare the risk and survival time of death and recovery among COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Methods: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with TB, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery comparing COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by TB status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Results: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients among those with tuberculosis was 2.17 times greater compared to those without tuberculosis (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients among those with tuberculosis was 25% less than the risk among those without tuberculosis (RR=0.75, 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death among COVID-19 patients with TB was significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery among those with TB was significantly longer than patients without TB (p=0.0046).

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a virtual reality (VR) game containing preventive skin cancer messaging and to assess the safety and satisfaction of the design based on end user feedback. METHODS: Using a two-phase design approach, we created a prototype VR game that immersed the player inside the human body while being confronted with growing cancer cells. The first design phase involved defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, choosing the technology platform, brainstorming, and designing esthetic elements. In the second design phase, we tested the prototype VR experience with stakeholders and end users in focus groups and interviews, with feedback incorporated into refining and improving the design. RESULTS: The focus groups and interviews were conducted with 18 participants. Qualitative feedback indicated high levels of satisfaction, with all participants reporting the VR game as engaging. A total of 11% (2/8) of participants reported a side effect of feeling nauseous during the experience. The end user feedback identified game improvements, suggesting an extended multistage experience with visual transitions to other environments and interactions involving cancer causation. The implementation of the VR game identified challenges in sharing VR equipment and hygiene issues.

Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2.

However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the intervention as they become available. The presence of time-varying external factors that impact study outcomes is a well-known limitation of SWDs; common approaches to adjusting for them make use of a mixed effects modeling framework. However, these models have several shortcomings when external factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters. METHODS: We discuss limitations of commonly used mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce opioid-related mortality, and propose extensions of these models to address these limitations. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models in the presence of external factors. We consider confounding by time, premature adoption of intervention components, and time-varying effect modification in which external factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters. RESULTS: In the presence of confounding by time, commonly used mixed effects models yield unbiased intervention effect estimates, but can have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models yield biased intervention effect estimates when premature intervention adoption or effect modification are present. In such scenarios, models incorporating fixed intervention-by-time interactions with an unstructured covariance for intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased intervention effect estimates, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed effects models can adjust for different combinations of external factors through correct specification of fixed and random time effects. Since model choice has considerable impact on validity of results and study power, careful consideration must be given to how these external factors impact study endpoints and what estimands are most appropriate in the presence of such factors.

One of the main causes of these clinical syndromes is thrombosis in placental and spinal cord vessels, however the mechanism for thrombus formation is unknown. Platelets form part of the thrombus and amplify and propagate thrombin generation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EHV-1 activates platelets. We found that two EHV-1 strains, RacL11 and Ab4 at 0.5 or higher plaque forming unit/cell, activate platelets within 10 minutes, causing -granule secretion (surface P-selectin expression) and platelet microvesiculation (increased small events double positive for CD41 and Annexin V). Microvesiculation was more pronounced with the RacL11 strain. Virus-induced P-selectin expression required plasma and 1.0 mM exogenous calcium. P-selectin expression was abolished and microvesiculation was significantly reduced in factor VII- or X-deficient human plasma. Both P-selectin expression and microvesiculation were re-established in factor VII-deficient human plasma with added purified human factor VIIa (1 nM). A glycoprotein C-deficient mutant of the Ab4 strain activated platelets as effectively as non-mutated Ab4. P-selectin expression was abolished and microvesiculation was significantly reduced by preincubation of virus with a goat polyclonal anti-rabbit tissue factor antibody. Infectious virus could be retrieved from washed EHV-1-exposed platelets, suggesting a direct platelet-virus interaction. Our results indicate that EHV-1 activates equine platelets and that -granule secretion is a consequence of virus-associated tissue factor triggering factor X activation and thrombin generation. Microvesiculation was only partly tissue factor and thrombin-dependent, suggesting the virus causes microvesiculation through other mechanisms, potentially through direct binding.

RESULTS: Normal laboratory procedures used to process the influenza virus were carried out independently and the amount of virus polluting the on-site atmosphere was measured. In particular, zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. In addition, common accidents associated with each process were simulated, including breaking glass containers, syringe injection of influenza virus solution, and rupturing of centrifuge tubes. A micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device was used to collect air samples. The collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation, the latter being detected by reverse-transcription PCR and HA test. The results showed that the air samples from the normal centrifugal group and the negative-control group were negative, while all other groups were positive for H5N1.

Recently, we presented an ab initio quantum mechanical model to characterize the interactions of spike proteins Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with select antibodies and ACE2 variants. The model identified weak links among the residues constituting interactions with the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2), and also enabled us to characterize in silico mutated RBDs to identify potential Variants of Concern (VOC). In particular, we focused on the role of RBD residue 484 in the interaction of the Delta variant with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). In this report, we apply our model to the Omicron VOC, and characterize its interaction pattern with hACE2. Our results show that (i) binding affinity with hACE2, compared to Delta, is considerably increased, possibly contributing to increased infectivity. (ii) The interaction pattern between B1.1.529 and hACE2 differs from previous variants by shifting the hot-spot interaction residues on hACE2, and potentially affecting nAbs efficacy.

Then, identifying the immunogenetic factors that affect the disease susceptibility and severity and as well as key inflammatory pathways that have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets needs to remain an active area of research.","output":"Geriatrics and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face coverings are going to be with us for quite some time and will present an additional communication hurdle for most of us.","output":"Face masks: be aware of the barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has hit the world hard, and has led to an unprecedent health and economic crisis. In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce. A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Re-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics time-course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis.

We report preliminary results from an NHS England endorsed clinical service implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (June-December 2020) which used FIT to prioritise colonoscopy in the highest risk LS patients in response to limited colonoscopy capacity throughout the pandemic.MethodsRegional genetic and endoscopy services across England were invited to participate, with the support of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). Patient eligibility was determined by 1) Diagnosis of Lynch Syndrome 2) Planned colonoscopic surveillance between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. Requests for FIT testing from participating NHS Trusts were sent to the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening South of England Hub in Guildford. The Hub sent patients a FIT kit (OC-Sensor? (Eiken, Japan)), instructions for use, a questionnaire, and a pre-paid return envelope. Laboratory reports with faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) results were returned electronically for clinical action. LS patients were risk-stratified for colonoscopy based upon the following f-Hb thresholds: (1) f-Hb  10g Hb/g faeces: triaged for colonoscopy via the two-week wait (2WW) pathway, (2) f-Hb 10g Hb/g faeces: schedule patients for colonoscopy within 6-12 weeks, where local endoscopy service availability permits.ResultsFourteen centres across England participated in the clinical service evaluation from 9th June 2020 to 1st December 2020. An uptake rate of 63% was observed from this cohort (269/428 invites). Of the 269 patients who returned their FIT devices, 20% (n=55) had f-Hb  10g Hb/g faeces and met criteria for urgent colonoscopy triage via the 2WW pathway. 29% (n=77) of patients had a f-Hb that was greater than the limit of detection of the assay (6g Hb/g faeces) yet below 10g Hb/g faeces. 22 patients (8%) had f-Hb between 6 and 9.9g Hb/g faeces. In a subgroup analysis of 67 patients from St Marks Hospital, the adenoma detection rate was 42.4%, and 9/67 proceeded to priority colonoscopy based on their FIT findings.ConclusionsImplementation of this clinical service during the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated clinical value for LS patients requiring routine surveillance. Further investigation on the efficacy of this novel intervention is warranted, namely as it pertains to additional data analysis to include endoscopy findings for participating LS patients to discern FIT sensitivity and specificity, which will be further explored under the auspices of a multi-centre prospective research study which is presently in development.","output":"Risk-stratified FIT for urgent colonoscopy in Lynch Syndrome: A clinical service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The claim of 'being led by the Holy Spirit' has caused African Pentecostals to develop weak fluid theologies.

PTX3 was recently described as one of the most reliable serological predictors of clinical deterioration and short-term mortality. The present study was designed to evaluate a correlation between serological biomarkers of inflammation and lung injury measured by QCT. Methods This retrospective monocentric study analysed a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted because of respiratory failure, or significant radiological involvement on chest CT scan. All patients, males and non-pregnant females older than 18 years, underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at admission. Exclusion criteria were defined by concurrent acute pathological processes and ongoing specific treatments which could interfere with immune activity. The cohort was stratified based on severity in mild and severe forms. Compromised lung at QCT was then correlated to serological biomarkers representative of Sars-CoV-2. We further developed a multivariable logistic model to predict CT data and clinical deterioration based on a specific molecular signature. Internal cross-validation led to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the tool that was provided by a score to simplify its application. Findings 592 patients were recruited between March 19th and December 1st, 2020. Applying exclusion criteria which consider confounders, the cohort resulted in 366 individuals characterized by 177 mild and 189 severe forms. In our predictive model, blood levels of PTX3, CRP and LDH were found to correlate with QCT values in mild COVID-19 disease. A signature of these three biomarkers had a high predictive accuracy in detecting compromised lungs as assessed by QCT. The score was elaborated and resulted representative of lung CT damage leading to clinical deterioration and oxygen need in mild disease. Interpretation The LDH, PTX3, CRP blood signature can serve as a strong correlate of compromised lung in COVID-19, possibly integrating cellular damage, systemic inflammation, myeloid and endothelial cell activation.","output":"A PTX3/LDH/CRP signature correlates with lung injury CTs scan severity and disease progression in paucisymptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Violence is triggered by personal history, lack of choices and opportunities, substance use or trafficking, racism, homophobia, genderism, and other forms of discrimination.1 In 2017, Salas-Wright et al. noted that, even though the incidence of fighting and violence among young people in the United States declined from 2002 to 2014, the pattern of disparities in youth involvement in these violent behaviors and the rate of homicides remained stable-consistently the highest among non-Hispanic African American youths, followed by Hispanic youths, and then non-Hispanic White youths.2 The health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 and of the 2020 through 2021 restrictive measures aimed at bringing the pandemic under control on the incidence ofyouth violence and on its prevention and control initiatives have yet to be assessed at a national level.

The outcome measure was hospital mortality. Areas under the ROC (AUC) curves were used to evaluate discrimination of the four predictive models. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves assessed applicability of the models to individual cases. RESULTS: During the study period, 1634 unique patients were identified. The mean age of the study cohort was 68.813.4 years. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease were the most common comorbidities. The crude hospital mortality was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-0.31). Evaluation of the predictive models showed an AUC range from 0.63 (95% CI 0.60-0.66) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.74) indicating fair to poor discrimination across all models. There were no significant differences among the AUC values of the four prognostic systems. All models calibrated poorly by either overestimated or underestimated hospital mortality.

PARTICIPANTS: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community.

Health authorities including the WHO and the US CDC have recognized the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in specific settings, although the ventilation requirements remain to be determined. In this work we consider the long-range airborne transmission as an extended short-range airborne route, which reconciles the link between short- and long-range airborne routes. The effective short-range distance is defined as the distance in short range at which long-range route has the same volumetric exposure value as that due to short-range route. Our data show that a decrease in ventilation rate or room volume per person, or an increase in the ratio of the number of infected to susceptible people reduces the effective short-range distance. In a normal breathing scenario with one out of five people infected and a room volume of 12 m3 per person to ensure an effective short-range distance of 1.5 m, a ventilation rate of 10 L/s per person is needed for a duration of 2 h. Our results suggest that effective environmental prevention strategies for respiratory infections require appropriate increases in the ventilation rate while maintaining a sufficiently low occupancy. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Demonstration of the long-range airborne route as an extended short-range airborne route suggests the significant role played by building ventilation in respiratory infection exposure. The reconciliation of short- and long-range airborne transmission suggests that the commonly observed dominance of close-contact transmission is a probable evidence of short-range airborne transmission, following a separate earlier study that revealed the relative insignificance of large droplet transmission in comparison with the short-range airborne-route.

BACKGROUND Healthcare service providers have worked to augment efforts to protect the public from the impact of epidemic events. While constituting the major healthcare taskforce, nurses are frequently tasked with fronting the response to an infectious disease outbreak. Given the crucial role of nurses in the management of prevailing epidemics, the constituents of their preparedness in epidemic events should be identified. DESIGN A systematic search was undertaken to identify eligible studies from the literature. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to extract and synthesise findings of the reviewed qualitative studies. METHODS Seven qualitative studies on nurses' experience and perceptions of epidemic events were examined for scientific quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Findings of these studies were synthesised adopting a narrative synthesis approach. RESULTS Three interplaying themes were identified as follows: (i) personal resources, (ii) workplace resources and (iii) situational influences. The findings suggest that an effective epidemic outbreak response would require further effort to reinforce the interplay between individual nurses, healthcare institutions and the governments. CONCLUSIONS The practical interplay among individual nurses, healthcare institutions and the governments is crucial in establishing an effective epidemic response. Further research on the understanding of the dynamic process of preparedness development is recommended to set future directions in research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study offers important insights for devising future strategies in enhancing nurses' preparedness and response to an epidemic event. These include recommendations on providing education and training to nurses regarding infectious diseases, fostering institutional assistance and support in an outbreak and revising government policies and planning.","output":"Nurses' preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks: A literature review and narrative synthesis of qualitative evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A diverse series of 43 novel \\"soft antimicrobials\\" based on quaternary ammonium pyridoxine derivatives which include six-membered acetals and ketals of pyridoxine bound via cleavable linker moieties (amide, ester) with a fragment of fatty carboxylic acid was designed. Nine compounds exhibited in vitro promising antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains with MIC values comparable with reference antiseptics miramistin, benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine. On various clinical isolates, the lead compounds 6i and 12a exhibited antibacterial activity comparable with that of benzalkonium chloride while higher than that of miramistin. Moreover, 6i and 12a were able to kill bacteria embedded into the matrix of mono- and dual species biofilms. The treatment of bacterial cells by either 6i and 12a lead to fast depolarization of the membrane suggesting that the membrane is an apparent molecular target of compounds. 6i and 12a were non mutagenic neither in SOS-chromotest nor in Ames test and non-toxic in vivo at acute oral (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg) and cutaneous administration (LD50 > 2500 mg/kg) on mice.

Consequently, they can potentially be tuned to remain intact in vivo until arrival at the tumour target where they are rapidly reduced to yield the active platinum(ii) species. However, in order to achieve this, uptake must be largely restricted to tumour cells and therefore uptake by healthy cells including red blood cells must be prevented. In this proof of concept study, we report on the effect of net charge as a means of controlling the uptake by red blood cells. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the complex does not influence the rate of reduction of the complexes by an excess of ascorbate. Using XANES spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the platinum(iv) complexes decreased the extent of reduction in whole blood, although probably not to the degree needed for the optimal delivery to tumours. Therefore, it is likely to be necessary to adopt higher charges and/or additional strategies to keep platinum(iv) prodrugs out of blood cells.","output":"The effect of charge on the uptake and resistance to reduction of platinum(IV) complexes in human serum and whole blood models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 the ongoing pandemic.

Little is known about the development of secondary bacterial or fungal infections in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, COVID patients receiving tocilizumab as treatment may be at higher risk for developing a secondary infection due to theoretical risk of immunosuppression. Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all COVID positive patients admitted to a 128 bed community hospital in Westchester County, NY from March 1 C May 31, 2020. The data was analyzed to determine incidence of secondary infections based on positive cultures in patients and further stratified based on receipt of tocilizumab. RESULTS: Out of 445 COVID positive patients reviewed, 69 (15.5%) had positive bacterial/fungal cultures. Average age of the patient population reviewed was 64 (range 1 C 106) and 60% of the patients were male. As of May 31, 2020, 114 of the patients had expired, 281 were discharged, 23 were transferred, and 27 were still admitted to the hospital. Of the 445 total patients, 42 received at least 1 dose of tocilizumab. Out of those patients, 6 patients (14.3%) had subsequent positive cultures. (Table 1) This was not statistically significant (p = 0.8185). Most common positive specimens were in urine (n=38), blood (n=33), and respiratory specimens (n=20).

We evaluated a rural Appalachian cohort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for its relation to obesity. METHODS Using American Thoracic Society 2018 diagnostic guidelines, an IPF cohort was systematically identified at an Appalachian academic medical center (2015-2019). The cohort was categorized in subgroups of body mass index (BMI) <30 or BMI 30 kg/m2. Demographics, clinical variables, and treatment details were collected retrospectively and evaluated for their associations with obesity. RESULTS In our IPF cohort (N = 138), a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern was less prevalent in the obese group (n = 49) relative to the nonobese group (69% vs 85%, respectively). The obese group was younger (mean age 73.27  9.12 vs 77.97  9.59 years) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (90% vs 72%), hyperlipidemia (83% vs 68%), diabetes mellitus (47% vs 25%), sleep-disordered breathing (47% vs 25%), chronic pain disorders (28% vs 15%), and deep vein thrombosis (19% vs 7%). An increased proportion of obese-IPF patients was seen at a tertiary or an interstitial lung disease center, with more surgical lung biopsies performed and incident diagnosis (ie, within 6 months of presentation) assigned. Only a minority of patients underwent lung transplantation (3.6%), all of them from the obese-IPF subgroup. Approximately 30% of the total IPF cohort died, with a lower mortality observed in the obese group (35% vs 20%, P = 0.017). An increasing BMI predicted a better survival in the total IPF cohort (BMI 25-29.9, 20-24.9, and <20 had mortality rates of 20%, 47%, and 75%, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study represents a first known effort to develop an IPF cohort in a rural Appalachian region.

We propose a mathematical framework to analyze IFN-I signaling and its impact on the interaction motif between virus, NK cells and macrophages. The model recapture divergent dynamics of coronavirus infections including the possibility for elevated secretion of IL-6 and IFN-{gamma} as a consequence of exacerbated macrophage activation. Dysfunction of NK cells recruitment increase disease severity by leading to a higher viral load peak, the possibility for excessive macrophage activation, and an elevated risk of the cytokine storm.

Previous studies suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) can interact with the renin-angiotensin system, ultimately causing increased production of angiotensin II. By reporting the cases of previously healthy young adults diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy after experiencing COVID-19, we raise the hypothesis that the SARS-Cov-2 infection could act as a trigger for leukemogenesis in predisposed individuals. METHODS: This was a case series performed through extraction of relevant clinical information from the medical records of three patients admitted to our Hematology unit between August 2020 and September 2020. MAIN RESULTS: Considering the relatively rapid development of cytopenias following recovery from COVID-19, it cannot be ruled out that SARS-Cov-2 played a role in leukemogenesis in those patients. Based on previous in vitro studies, the renin-angiotensin system imbalance induced by SARS-CoV-2 could potentially promote in vivo leukemogenesis through several mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Despite the advances in pathophysiological and clinical characterization of COVID-19, the consequences of the pandemic to the incidence of hematologic diseases are still to be elucidated. In this context, future dissection of the status of the local bone marrow renin-angiotensin system in leukemogenesis is a clinically relevant basic research area.","output":"Can SARS-CoV-2 induce hematologic malignancies in predisposed individuals?

The purpose of this review is to highlight current research on these conditions, their inter-relationship, modes of measurement, and current approaches to management. RECENT FINDINGS: Sleep deprivation and delirium are closely linked, with shared clinical characteristics, risk factors, and neurochemical abnormalities. Acetylcholine and dopamine are important neurochemicals in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and their dysregulation has been implicated in development of delirium. In the hospital setting, poor sleep and delirium are associated with adverse outcomes; non-pharmacological interventions are recommended, but tend to be resource intensive and hindered by a lack of reliable sleep measurement tools. Delirium is easier to identify, with validated tools available in both ICU and non-ICU settings; however, an optimal treatment approach remains unclear. Antipsychotics are used widely to prevent and treat delirium, although the efficacy data are equivocal. Bundled non-pharmacologic approaches represent a promising framework for prevention and management. SUMMARY: Poor sleep and delirium are common problems in older patients. While these phenomena appear linked, a causal relationship is not clearly established. At present, there are no established sleep-focused guidelines for preventing or treating delirium.

Current treatments differentiate severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with different products and programs. This differentiation is complex and costly. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, unified SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6-59 months. Eliminating the need for separate products and protocols could improve the impact of programs by treating children more easily and cost-effectively, reaching more children globally. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial compared a combined protocol against standard care in Kenya and South Sudan. Randomization was stratified by country. Combined protocol clinics treated children using 2 sachets of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) per day for those with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm and/or edema, and 1 sachet of RUTF per day for those with MUAC 11.5 to <12.5 cm. Standard care clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations, and MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). The primary outcome was nutritional recovery. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, coverage, defaulting, death, length of stay, and average daily weight and MUAC gains. Main analyses were per-protocol, with intention-to-treat analyses also conducted. The non-inferiority margin was 10%. From 8 May 2017 to 31 March 2018, 2,071 children were enrolled in 12 combined protocol clinics (mean age 17.4 months, 41% male), and 2,039 in 12 standard care clinics (mean age 16.7 months, 41% male). In total, 1,286 (62.1%) and 1,202 (59.0%), respectively, completed treatment; 981 (76.3%) on the combined protocol and 884 (73.5%) on the standard protocol recovered, yielding a risk difference of 0.03 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.10, p = 0.52; per-protocol analysis, adjusted for country, age, and sex). The amount of ready-to-use food (RUTF or RUSF) required for a child with SAM to reach full recovery was less in the combined protocol (122 versus 193 sachets), and the combined protocol cost US$123 less per child recovered (US$918 versus US$1,041). There were 23 (1.8%) deaths in the combined protocol arm and 21 (1.8%) deaths in the standard protocol arm (adjusted risk difference 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.87). There was no evidence of a difference between the protocols for any of the other secondary outcomes. Study limitations included contextual factors leading to defaulting, a combined multi-country power estimate, and operational constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment for SAM and MAM is non-inferior to standard care. Further research should focus on operational implications, cost-effectiveness, and context (Asia versus Africa; emergency versus food-secure settings). This trial is complete and registered at ISRCTN (ISRCTN30393230).

We tested the hypothesis that FDA-approved antiretrovirals, antibiotics, and antimalarials will effectively inhibit COVID-19 two major drug targets, coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified. The study showed that COVID-19 likely originated from bat, owing to the over 90% genomic similarity observed, and that lopinavir, levofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine might serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for additional optimization and drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In April 2020, the US FDA exercised enforcement discretion for the temporary use of inpatient CGM during the pandemic, thus hospitals were presented the opportunity to implement this technology. METHODS: We sought to investigate the accuracy of CGM in hospitalized patients on general care floors and the intensive care unit (ICU) in attempts to decrease healthcare professional exposure to COVID-19 and ultimately improve glycemic management of patients affected by COVID-19. Point of care (POC) and laboratory (Lab) glucose values were matched with simultaneous CGM glucose values and measures of accuracy were performed to evaluate the safety and usability of CGM in this population. Our data are presented drawing a distinction between POC and Lab as reference glucose sources. RESULTS: In 808 paired samples obtained from 28 patients (10 ICU, 18 general floor), overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for all patients using either POC or Lab as reference was 13.2%. When using POC as the reference glucose MARD was 13.9% and using Lab glucose as reference 10.9%. Using both POC and Lab reference glucose pairs the overall MARD for critical care patients was 12.1% and for general floor patients 14%. CONCLUSION: We determined, with proper protocols and safeguards in place, use of CGM in the hospitalized patient is a reasonable alternative to standard of care to achieve the goal of reducing healthcare professional exposure. Further study is necessary to validate safety, accuracy, and efficacy of this technology.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify the preferable SBT (T-piece or pressure support ventilation [PSV]). METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to the 31st of July 2019. We included RCTs involving adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent at least two different SBT methods. All authors reported our primary outcome of successful extubation rate and clearly compared PS versus T-piece with clinically relevant secondary outcomes (rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality). Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Ten RCTs including 3165 patients were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate between the T-piece group and PS group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78C1.07; P = 0.27; I(2) = 79%). In addition, compared with the PS group, the T-piece group showed no significant difference in the rate of reintubation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78C1.26; P = 0.95; I(2) = 5%), ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83C1.80; P = 0.30; I(2) = 0%), hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99C1.87; P = 0.06; I(2) = 19%), ICU length of stay (mean difference = ? 0.10; 95% CI, ? 0.59 to 0.39; P = 0.69; I(2) = 13%), and hospital length of stay (mean difference = ? 0.82;95% CI, ? 2.2 to 0.55; P = 0.24; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: T-piece and PSV as SBTs are considered to have comparable predictive power of successful extubation in critically ill patients.

This study aimed to determine the sufficiency of the hospital beds available to the healthcare system of Yamanashi, Japan, in accommodating hospitalized and severely ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In total, 60 hospitals, with > 20 beds each, were included in this study (n = 10,684). However, beds in the psychiatric and tuberculosis wards (n = 2,295), nonoperational beds (n = 376), and beds for patients in the recovery and chronic phases (n = 3,494) were excluded. The projected occupancy rate was calculated based on the estimated number of patients, including severely ill patients requiring hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the number of hospitalized patients, we created an adjusted model to calculate the mean occupancy rate of beds for each medical area in the prefecture (Model 1), which is free of areal occupancy rate biases. Moreover, we created an adjusted model that places severely ill patients in the two advanced acute hospitals in Yamanashi, thereby calculating the bed occupancy rates in other hospitals with > 200 beds (Model 2). RESULTS: A total of 4,519 beds were analyzed. Although the existing infectious disease beds may not be able to accommodate the projected number of severely ill patients, the existing capacity can accommodate all patients projected to require hospitalization during the pandemic. In Model 1, the mean bed occupancy rate was 50%. Conversely, in Model 2, advanced acute hospital beds were insufficient for the projected number of severely ill patients, and the mean bed occupancy rate was 72.5%.

The review's objective was to determine the risk of SCD and SCA in PLWH. To do this, the electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published before January 31, 2021. Reference lists of the included studies were searched for further identification of relevant studies. The search terms included: \\"Sudden Cardiac Death,\\" \\"Sudden Cardiac Arrest,\\" \\"Human Immunodeficiency virus,\\" \\"HIV,\\" \\"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,\\" and \\"AIDS.\\" Only observational studies that assessed the association between SCD and SCA in PWLH were selected. Data were extracted by two independent authors who screened titles, abstracts, and articles to meet the inclusion criterion. Quality assessment was done by using modified Downs and Black checklist. A total of seven studies were included in this review. Five studies revealed a higher incidence of SCD in PLWH, two of which focused on patients with HIV and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The other two studies were about the association of HIV and SCA. Studies reported that PLWH had a three- to five-fold higher incidence of SCD as compared to non-HIV patients. HIV patients with low LVEF had a higher incidence of SCD than HIV patients with normal LVEF. PLWH had a higher incidence of SCA and less successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to patients without HIV. After adjusting for various confounders in multiple studies, all the studies reported a higher incidence of SCD in PLWH. To conclude, PLWH is at an increased risk of SCD and SCA. Some risk factors for this include LVEF, viral load (VL), and the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count. There is a paucity of data on the mechanisms involved, although a higher prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and interstitial fibrosis in PLWH may play a role. Because of the general suboptimal quality of the heterogeneous nature of the current evidence, further, rigorous studies are needed to determine the association of increased risk of SCD and SCA in PLWH.","output":"Sudden Cardiac Death and Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to develop a visual protein chip that can differentiate the antibodies induced by avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus and infectious bursal disease virus, simultaneously.

Antimicrobial resistance is now a major public health threat posing significant challenges for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In Bangladesh, where over one third of the population is below the poverty line, the achievement of safe and effective antibiotic medication use for human health is challenging. OBJECTIVE: To explore factors and practices around access and use of antibiotics and understanding of antimicrobial resistance in rural communities in Bangladesh from a socio-cultural perspective. METHODS: This qualitative study comprises the second phase of the multi-country ABACUS (Antibiotic Access and Use) project in Matlab, Bangladesh. Information was collected through six focus group discussions and 16 in-depth interviews. Informants were selected from ten villages in four geographic locations using the Health and Demographic Surveillance System database. The Access to Healthcare Framework guided the interpretation and framing of the findings in terms of individuals abilities to: perceive, seek, reach, pay and engage with healthcare. RESULTS: Village pharmacies were the preferred and trusted source of antibiotics for self-treatment. Cultural and religious beliefs informed the use of herbal and other complementary medicines. Advice on antibiotic use was also sourced from trusted friends and family members. Access to government-run facilities required travel on poorly maintained roads. Reports of structural corruption, stock-outs and patient safety risks eroded trust in the public sector. Some expressed a willingness to learn about antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance is both a health and development issue. Social and economic contexts shape medicine seeking, use and behaviours.

In addition, hydrocarbons with wider carbon number ranges (e.g., gasoline-, jet fuel-, diesel-, and motor oil-range hydrocarbons) were produced in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The yields of the gasoline-, jet fuel-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons obtained from the single-use mask were highest at 973 K. The pyrolysis of the single-use face mask yielded 14.7 wt% gasoline-, 18.4 wt% jet fuel-, 34.1 wt% diesel-, and 18.1 wt% motor oil-range hydrocarbons. No solid char was produced via the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The addition of food waste to the pyrolysis feedstock led to the formation of char, but the presence of the single-use face mask did not affect the properties and energy content of the char. More H(2) and less hydrocarbons were produced by co-feeding food waste in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The results of this study can contribute to thermochemical management and utilization of everyday waste as a source of energy.","output":"COVID-19 mask waste to energy via thermochemical pathway: Effect of Co-Feeding food waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 can cause multiple organ injuries in some susceptible people in a short time, which seriously threatens the health and safety of people, and intensive care and multiple extracorporeal organ support are important means of treatment Although many experts' consensus and clinical guidelines have been published, a series of clinical problemsstill exist during the treatment procedure, and no consensushas not been reached until now Therefore, in this paper wemake some reflections and explorations to provide experience and help for clinicians","output":"Reflections and understanding of the extracorporeal organ support in critically illpatients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes in the healthcare system. Whilst adult services were overwhelmed with sick patients there was an unprecedented decline in paediatric attendances. Objectives The objective is to monitor the trends and understand change in PED attendances so that we can make decisions regarding any planned restructuring post COVID-19. Methods Data from PED attendances and admissions from March 2020 to date was extracted and compared to the same period in 2019. Case notes of children who presented with sepsis/serious illness were analysed to learn if there was a delay in presentation, Results The noticeable difference in 2020 was the 65- 75% reduction in PED attendances for minor acuity illness (URTI, tonsillitis, otitis media, gastroenteritis) Injury visits fell to 65% below normal just after lockdown was announced, increasing to 50% below normal by July and August falling to less than 50% during the second lockdown. Fractures, likely include a significant number of playground injuries, fell to 70% below normal. The 60 - 70% reduction in PED attendances in soft tissue injuries was consistent with both lockdowns and children no longer attending school and possibly reduced participation in sporting activities. There was an initial decrease(20% in April 2020 compared to 2019) followed by an increase in children to the same numbers as seen in 2020 August and September presenting to PED with mental illness as the pandemic progressed with an increasing proportion of children who had not presented to PED before the onset of the pandemic. Dramatic (80%) reduction in respiratory illness(bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup) was noted in the winter months. December is normally peak season for bronchiolitis and asthma/viral induced wheeze, for the first time such a dramatic reduction in attendance and admissions were noted in winter. The children who presented to PED in 2020 with a serious illness and sepsis presented in a timely manner. Analysis of the timeline of events showed that parents had tried to manage them at home with the help of 111 and virtual GP clinics. When they could not be successfully managed at home, parents were able to correctly identify this and brought them to PED. Conclusions Over the years it has been observed that many children present to the emergency department with minor acuity illness that can be managed at home or by primary care. The pandemic data provides a unique opportunity to view this data, insights from this can be translated into planning services resulting in a sustained reduction in PED visits for minor acuity and self limiting illness. Social distancing to combat COVID-19 and universal precautions appear to have prevented circulation of communicable diseases. Improved compliance with home asthma medication, reduced air pollution levels, and reduced exposure to viral triggers and allergens likely contributed to the reduced number of children with wheeze or asthma. Parents know that hospitals are open and ready to care for their children when they need them, but also feel confident to manage minor ailments at home with watchful waiting.","output":"Paediatric ED attendances viewed through the COVID lens-perspective from an emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Altered bone turnover is a factor in many diseases including osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis, inflammation, and viral infection. The absence of obvious symptoms and insufficiently sensitive biomarkers in the early stages of bone loss limits early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it is urgent to identify novel, more sensitive, and easy-to-detect biomarkers which can be used in the diagnosis and prognosis of bone health. Our previous data using standard micro-computed tomography (CT) measurements showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice significantly decreased trabecular bone volume at the lumbar spine, suggesting that decreased bone mass, increased fracture risk, and OA may be underappreciated long-haul comorbidities for COVID patients. In this study, we applied integrated state-of-the-art radiomics and machine learning models to identify more sensitive image-based biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2-induced bone loss from CT images. These radiomic biomarkers can potentially provide a non-invasive way of quantifying and monitoring systemic bone loss and evaluating treatment efficacy in both research and clinical practices. Methods: All animal use was performed with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To quantify SARS-CoV-2-induced bone loss, 6-week-old transgenic mice (16 male, 16 female) expressing humanized ACE2 receptors were inoculated with a 2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 or phosphate-buffered saline (Control) [Fig. A]. Viral infection was confirmed by detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs and histological identification of SARS-CoV-2 labeled cells. At 6-14 days post-infection, lumbar vertebral bodies (L5) were scanned with CT (CT 35, SCANCO Medical AG;6 m nominal voxel size). The open-source research platform 3D Slicer v2020 with a built-in Python console v3.8 was used for medical image computing and fully automated segmentation of cortical and trabecular bone. Standard CT assessment of bone microstructure was performed. Radiomic feature extraction and data processing were performed using python based PyRadiomics v3.0.1. A total of 120 radiographic features were extracted from the segmented images [Fig. B]. Principle component analysis (PCA) for feature selection, a support vector machine learning (SVML) predictive model for classification, holdback method for model validation, and all statistical analyses (significance at p<0.05) were performed using JMP Pro v15 (SAS). Results: Using standard CT methods, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) by 10 and 10.5% (p= 0.04) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) by 8 and 9% (p= 0.02) in male and female mice, respectively, compared to PBS control mice [Fig. C]. Radiomics detected a 20-fold greater magnitude in change over standard methods. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly changed radiographic parameters with the largest change being a 300% increase in the second-order parameter: cluster shade [Fig. D]. The 45 radiomic features comprising the first 3 principal components were selected for inclusion in the SVML model. The SVML Model (radial basis function kernel;cost = 4.8;gamma = 0.46) produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 1.0 which reflects a perfectly accurate test [Fig. E]. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection of humanized ACE2 expressing mice caused significant bone changes, suggesting that decreased bone mass, increased fracture risk, OA, and other musculoskeletal complications could be long-term comorbidities for people infected with COVID-19. We developed an open-source, fully automated segmentation and radiomics system to assess systemic bone loss using CT images. When coupled with machine learning, this system was able to identify novel radiographic biomarkers of bone loss that better discriminate differences in bone microstructure between SARS-CoV-2 infected and control mice than standard bone morphometric indices. The high accuracy of the SVML model in classifying SARS-CoV-2 infected mice opens the possibility of translating these biom rkers to the clinical setting for early detection of skeletal changes associated with long-haul COVID. The methods presented here were demonstrated using SARS-CoV-2 as a model system and can also be adapted to other diseases associated with altered bone turnover. Development of machine-learning methods for radiomic applications is a crucial step toward clinically relevant radiomic biomarkers of bone health and provides a non-invasive way of quantifying and monitoring systemic bone loss and evaluating treatment efficacy.

The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2C3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including EpsteinCBarr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS.

OBJECTIVES: This scoping review was done with the objective of exploring the evidence on the role of saliva as an alternate diagnostic sample in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 condition. METHODS: Thorough search of the literature in major databases was undertaken in June 2020 using free text and MESH terms, followed by PRISMA to identify 17 studies for data extraction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was summarised for study characteristics, salivary sampling characteristics, viral load, and longevity of virus in saliva. The literature supports that saliva offers a simple sample collection method compared to technique-sensitive NPS and has the advantage of point-of-care testing for initial screening in community or hospital-based set-up. The additional highlights of this review are heterogeneity in the current literature and the gaps in methodology. Therefore, a robust study design to generate higher levels of evidence has been proposed.","output":"Exploring salivary diagnostics in COVID-19: a scoping review and research suggestions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging public health tool to understand the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in communities. The performance of different virus concentration methods and PCR methods needs to be evaluated to ascertain their suitability for use in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. We evaluated ultrafiltration and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation methods to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from sewage in wastewater treatment plants and upstream in the wastewater network (e.g., manholes, lift stations). Recovery of viruses by different concentration methods was determined using Phi6 bacteriophage as a surrogate for enveloped viruses. Additionally, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in all wastewater samples was determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), targeting three genetic markers (N1, N2 and E). Using spiked samples, the Phi6 recoveries were estimated at 2.6C11.6% using ultrafiltration-based methods and 22.2C51.5% using PEG precipitation. There was no significant difference in recovery efficiencies (p < 0.05) between the PEG procedure with and without a 16 h overnight incubation, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining same day results. The SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers were more often detected by RT-ddPCR than RT-qPCR with higher sensitivity and precision. While all three SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers were detected using RT-ddPCR, the levels of E gene were almost below the limit of detection using RT-qPCR. Collectively, our study suggested PEG precipitation is an effective low-cost procedure which allows a large number of samples to be processed simultaneously in a routine wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2. RT-ddPCR can be implemented for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers in different wastewater matrices.

Due to the emergency situation in the public health system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as a measure of social accountability, remote medical care services and online education were adopted in order to continue following the curricular program and to provide assistance to local city governments. Experience report: Two months before graduation, medical students followed-up on the monitoring of residents and COVID-19 healthcare professionals of forty-three ILPIs (Long-Term Elderly Care Facilities) in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The medical students made daily telephone calls to all these ILPI units, requesting information, generally from the head nurses and owners, about the main COVID-19 symptoms that were detected in the residents and employees of these facilities. All the collected information was discussed daily with the teacher in charge of mentoring the program, fed into an online database and into a work schedule chart, then relayed to the local Municipal Health Secretariat. A COVID-19 contingency plan was devised by the team, authorized by the Local Health Secretariat and then presented to the ILPIs, aiming to offer them the best guidance throughout the pandemic. Discussion: the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the Health Education System's fragilities, limitations and capacity to adapt to this crisis, thus largely contributing to improving the training of new medical doctors. During the program, medical students faced many challenges, especially regarding the difficulty to contact some ILPIs by telephone, omitted or erroneous information provided by employees in these facilities and delays in reporting suspected cases. In spite of this scenario, daily contact with these facilities allowed the team to identify the ILPIs that were more adequately prepared and the ones that needed auditing and further supervision. Also, this daily contact established a bond between the team and the ILPIs. Conclusion: During the pandemic, it was possible to perform actions according to the logic of social accountability, demonstrating that remote online medical practice is a tool capable of both maintaining interns in contact with the practical aspects of medical care and providing medical assistance to the community and to the local government.","output":"Telemedicine in long-term elderly care facilities as \\"social accountability\\" in the context of Covid-19/ Telemedicina nas instituies de longa permanncia para idosos como social accountability no contexto da Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma alkalescens is an arginine-metabolizing mycoplasma, which has been found in association with mastitis and arthritis in cattle.

Adolescents responded to a baseline survey to assess hearing health-related behaviors prior to reviewing the presentation. A postprogram survey was administered 1 week after the presentation to assess change in knowledge and attitudes toward NIHL prevention. Online collaborations with schoolteachers helped with project implementation. Postreflection papers written by AuD students regarding the eSL activities were analyzed. Lastly, suggestions from a focus group of educators were included that highlight the role of interprofessional collaborations to enhance school-based hearing conservation opportunities. Results The HEAR presentation resulted in changes in knowledge about NIHL among the adolescents.

In this format, learners are allowed to use revision notes, textbooks and other permitted material during their examination. Traditionally, dentistry is assessed using closed-book examinations where the use of such materials is prohibited. Learners will have limited or no prior experience of open-book examinations in dentistry, hence this educational evaluation aimed to explore their experiences and assess suitability for continuity of this examination. Methods A retrospective anonymous survey was conducted on all undergraduate dentistry and oral health sciences learners on completion of their examination and once they received their results. The questionnaire was designed to contain both qualitative and quantitative data items, validated through previous published studies. All authors independently analysed the data through tallying quantitative parameters and thematically analysing qualitative free text. Results In total, 210 learners participated in the survey, with 52.4% strongly agreeing a preference for open-book examinations. In addition, 42.9% of learners either agreed or strongly agreed that less preparation was required for open-book examinations; however, 80.5% reported learning new information. Furthermore, 85.2% disagreed or strongly disagreed that open-book examinations were stressful. Thematic analysis highlighted four core themes: stress, memorisation of facts, motivation to learn and unfairness. Conclusions There were several learning points for both educators and learners that can be actioned for future open-book examinations, including tailoring exam questions to foster application of knowledge rather than resource-searching skills, intended learning objective mapping against curriculum requirements and learner preparation.

Data embedding is typically utilized as one of the solutions to address the aforementioned issues. One of the important requirements of data embedding is to maximize embedding capacity with minimal bit rate overhead while ensuring imperceptibility of the inserted data. However, embedding capacity varies depending on the video content and increasing the embedding capacity usually leads to video quality degradation. In this work, a threshold-controlled block splitting technique is proposed for embedding data into SHVC video. Specifically, the embedding capacity can be increased by coding the host video by using more small blocks, which can be achieved by tuning a threshold-controlled parameter in the rate distortion optimization process. Subsequently, the predictive syntax elements in both intra and inter-coded blocks are jointly utilized to embed data, which ensures that data can be embedded regardless of the prediction mode used in coding a block. Results suggest that the proposed method can achieve a trade-off between the increase in embedding capacity and bit rate overhead while maintaining video quality. In the best case scenario, the sequence PartyScene can embed 516.9 kbps with an average bit rate overhead of +7.0% for the Low Delay P configuration, while the same video can embed 1578.6 kbps with an average bit rate overhead of +2.9% for the All Intra configuration.","output":"Data Embedding in SHVC Video Using Threshold-Controlled Block Splitting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Markovian credit migration models are a reasonably standard tool nowadays, but there are fundamental difficulties with calibrating them.

We carried out an external validation of version 1 of the QCovid algorithm in Scotland. METHODS: We established a national COVID-19 data platform using individual level data for the population of Scotland (5.4 million residents). Primary care data were linked to reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) virology testing, hospitalisation and mortality data. We assessed the performance of the QCovid algorithm in predicting COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in our dataset for two time periods matching the original study: 1 March 2020 to 30 April 2020, and 1 May 2020 to 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Our dataset comprised 5 384 819 individuals, representing 99% of the estimated population (5 463 300) resident in Scotland in 2020. The algorithm showed good calibration in the first period, but systematic overestimation of risk in the second period, prior to temporal recalibration.

Since then, the world has been firmly in the grip of the COVID-19. To date, more than 211 730 035 million confirmed cases and more than 4 430 697 million people have died. While controlling the virus and implementing vaccines are the main priorities, the population mental health impacts of the pandemic are expected to be longer term and are less obvious than the physical health ones. Lockdown restrictions, physical distancing, social isolation, as well as the loss of a loved one, working in a frontline capacity and loss of economic security may have negative effects on and increase the mental health challenges in populations around the world. There is a major demand for long-term research examining the mental health experiences and needs of people in order to design adequate policies and interventions for sustained action to respond to individual and population mental health needs both during and after the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This repeated cross-sectional mixed-method study conducts regular self-administered representative surveys, and targeted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with adults in the UK, as well as validation of gathered evidence through citizens juries for contextualisation (for the UK as a whole and for its four devolved nations) to ensure that emerging mental health problems are identified early on and are properly understood, and that appropriate policies and interventions are developed and implemented across the UK and within devolved contexts.

Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 ctp mutant, namely MR14, is known to cause cell wall defects and autolysis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ctp mutationCdriven autolysis in regulating biofilms in A. baumannii and to evaluate the vesiculation caused by cell wall defects. We found that in A. baumannii, Ctp is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane, and loss of Ctp function enhances the biofilm-forming ability of A. baumannii. Quantification of the matrix components revealed that extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins were the chief constituents of MR14 biofilm, and the transmission electron microscopy further indicated the presence of numerous dead cells compared with ATCC 17978. The large number of MR14 dead cells is potentially the result of compromised outer membrane integrity, as demonstrated by its high sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). MR14 also exhibited the hypervesiculation phenotype, producing outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) of large mean size. The MR14 OMVs were more cytotoxic toward A549 cells than ATCC 17978 OMVs.

We examined how individuals' thinking about the SC of COVID-19 infection influenced preventive intention through this specific case, the early phase of the pandemic in South Korea (March, 2020) when concerns regarding SC were very high but vaccines were not available. We theoretically investigated the path from information exposure about COVID-19, worry and risk perception about SC of COVID-19, attitudes/norms/self-efficacy, and preventive intention. An online survey of 805 South Koreans revealed that information exposure about COVID-19 was positively associated with worry and risk perception about the SC, which indirectly predicted preventive intention through attitudes/norms/self-efficacy. As COVID-19 is a new disease, people learned about it from various sources, and contemplated (worry and risk perception) its negative social outcomes. To avoid such negative SC, they might have changed their beliefs toward preventive behavior, which influenced preventive intention. Given that both worry (affective-cognitive state) and risk perception (cognitive evaluation) are related to thinking activities, the findings suggest that individuals' thinking about negative SC of COVID-19 infection might have partly contributed to the success of the early South Korean quarantine model. However, the results also raise critical questions as to how we can protect individuals' lives during a public health crisis.","output":"Thinking about Social Consequences of COVID-19 Influenced Preventive Intention: The Case of South Korea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently countries are facing a new crisis caused by the COVID-19, which leads to the rise of government expenditures and additional borrowing. This situation highlights the importance of examine factors which determine the level of public debt that still sustains economic growth. A growing body of research supports the idea of a non-linear debtCgrowth relationship and estimates the threshold level above which debt becomes unsustainable and has a negative effect on output. The empirical evidence points out that there is no single sustainable debt threshold level that holds for all countries. This research complements scarce empirical evidence on the heterogeneous debtCgrowth relationship and provides some insights on the publicly available statistical indicators that might signal a relatively low/high expenditure multiplier and, at the same time, potentially unsustainable/sustainable growth stimulus through the use of borrowed funds. We test the hypothesis that the expenditure multiplier is shaping the impact of public debt on growth. Our empirical examination is based on panel data analysis in the groups of countries with expected relatively high and low expenditure multiplier. Research results show that a statistically significant negative marginal effect of debt on growth starts to manifest at a lower debt-to-GDP ratio when the expenditure multiplier is lower and vice-versa. The study shed some light on the sources of heterogeneity in a debtCgrowth relationship. We can conclude that countries with a high expenditure multiplier level can borrow more and sustain growth.

Few prospective echocardiographic studies have been performed to characterize cardiac manifestations of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection. There are limited data on the residual echocardiographic findings including strain analysis of post-COVID patients. One aim of our CIHR-funded study is to prospectively phenotype post-COVID patients using conventional echocardiography including strain imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS All patients discharged from hospital following acute COVID-19 infection are systematically followed in the Post-COVID-19 Recovery Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital and St. Paul's Hospital. At about 4-12 weeks post diagnosis, patients undergo comprehensive echocardiographic assessment with conventional echocardiography including strain analysis. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by 3D, 2D Biplane Simpson's, or visual estimate. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), was measured using a vendor-independent 2D speckle-tracking software (TomTec). A total of 127 patients (53% female, mean age 58 years) were included in our analyses. At baseline, cardiac conditions were present in 58% of the patients (15% coronary artery disease, 4% heart failure, 44% hypertension, 10% atrial fibrillation), while the remainder were free of cardiac conditions. COVID-19 serious complications were present in 79% of the patients (76% pneumonia, 37% ICU admission, 21% intubation, 1% myocarditis). Normal LVEF was seen in 96% of cohort defined in this study as EF54%, and 97% had normal RV systolic function. A high proportion (53%) had abnormal LV GLS defined as < 18%. Average LV GLS in septal and inferior segments were lower compared to the rest. In patients without pre-existing cardiac conditions, LVEF was abnormal in only 1.9% but LV GLS was abnormal in 46%. CONCLUSION Most post-COVID patients had normal LVEF at 4-12 weeks post positive test, but over half had abnormal LV GLS. Even when patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions were excluded, 46% had abnormal global strain. There appeared to be a high predilection for septal, and to a lesser extent, inferior wall involvement, giving an appearance of a C sign on the bullseye strain map. Further studies are needed to confirm whether these abnormalities are consistently found and to understand the long-term cardiac sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"CARDIAC PHENOTYPING OF SARS-COV-2 IN BC: A PROSPECTIVE ECHO STUDY WITH STRAIN IMAGING"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue of the European Journal of Pain you will find the article by Oguz-Akarsu and collaborators entitled \\"Insight into Pain Syndromes in Acute Phase of Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19: Frequency, Clinical Characteristics, and Associated Factors\\" (Oguz-Akarsu et al., 2021).

In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of two BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in allogeneic HSCT recipients compared to healthy controls. IgG antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott, Ireland). The cutoff value of the test used in this study is 7.1 BAU/mL (Binding Antibody Unit/mL) and the results greater than 7.1 indicate that seroconversion has occurred, as recommended by the manufacturer. Peripheral blood samples were collected for immunological analysis at three timepoints: pre-vaccine baseline (w0, before the first BNT162b2 dose), week 3 (w3, before the second vaccine dose) and week 5 (w5, 2 weeks following the second dose). Patients older than 18 years who received BNT162b2 vaccine following an HSCT at seven Italian centers were included in the study. Enrolled patients received two successive doses (at 3-week interval) at a median of 15 months (range 2-141) after HSCT. Twenty-nine age-matched health care workers who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 were recruited as the control group. Among the 34 patients evaluable for serological response, three patients were excluded from the analysis as the baseline serology demonstrated previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. On w3, after the first vaccine dose 7/31 (23%) patients developed anti-S IgG antibodies as compared to 28/29 (97%) controls (p<0.01). HSCT recipients showed lower antibody titers (median 1.8 BAU, range 0-481) as compared to healthy controls (median 118 BAU, range 6-1172, p<0.01). In univariate analysis, transplant-to-vaccination interval (>12 months, p<0.01), baseline CD4+ T cell count (>200/mm3, p=0.01), and CD4+CD45RA+ T naive cell count (>100/ mm3, p<0.01) were significantly associated with antibody response after the first vaccine dose. On w5, after the second vaccine dose, 24/31 (77%) of the patients showed antibody response, as compared to 99% of healthy controls (p<0.01); in fact, 71% of non-responders to the first dose developed IgG antibodies after vaccine boost (Figure 1). Median antibody titer after second dose was 350 BAU/ml (0-21.731). In univariate analysis, no significant association was found between patient characteristics and immunogenicity after vaccine boost. Adverse events were rare and modest. Nine percent of the patients reported mild local reactions after vaccine administration, including pain at the injection site and less commonly local erythema, local lymphadenopathy, or swelling; 35% of patients reported systemic adverse events, and all were mild. The most frequently reported systemic reactions included weakness (15%), headache (9%), and diarrhea (3%). In conclusion, in recipients of HSCT, a single dose of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine yielded poor efficacy, while immunogenicity increased significantly after vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose. Patients who received vaccines beyond one year after transplant were more likely to mount anti-S IgG antibodies, which could be due to a broader immune reconstitution, as we observed an enhanced response to single BNT162b2 vaccine dose in patients with higher CD4+ T cell and particularly CD4+CD45RA+ na?ve T cell counts.

After proteinase K was added into a bacterial sample to lyse the bacteria and release the DNA, it was continuous-flow injected into the serpentine channel of the extraction chip, where magnetic silica bead chains had been formed in advance using a homogeneous magnetic field generated by two concentric semicircle magnets to capture the MSBs. Then, the flowing DNA was captured by the MSB chains, washed with alcohol, dried with gas, and eluted with deionized water to obtain the purified and concentrated DNA. Finally, the extracted DNA templates were injected into a microfluidic PCR chip with lyophilized amplification reagents and determined using a commercial qPCR device.

Although this is a plausible hypothesis, there is no evidence that complications or mortality rates in neuromuscular patients are higher than in the general population. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders. METHODS: A registry of children with neuromuscular conditions and laboratory-confirmed-SARS-CoV-2 infection was set up by the Neuromuscular Working Group of the Spanish Pediatric Neurology Society (SENEP). Data to be collected were focused on the characteristics and baseline status of the neuromuscular condition and the course of COVID-19. RESULTS: Severe complications were not observed in our series of 29 children with neuromuscular disorders infected by SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-nine percent of patients were clinically categorized as asymptomatic or mild cases and 10% as moderate cases. Patients with a relatively more severe course of COVID-19 had SMA type 1 and were between 1 and 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The course of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders may not be as severe as expected. The protective role of young age seems to outweigh the risk factors that are common in neuromuscular patients, such as a decreased respiratory capacity or a weak cough.

Differences across clusters are highlighted using detailed data on job characteristics, including tasks, educational requirements and working conditions. Two clusters with favourable or average working conditions account for more than three-quarters of jobs in essential occupations. Another two clusters, comprising 20% of jobs in essential occupations, are associated with unfavourable working conditions such as low pay, job insecurity, poor prospects for advancement and low autonomy. These latter clusters exhibit high shares of migrants. Further evidence suggests that this pattern is linked to educational requirements and how recent migrants evaluate job characteristics. It is argued that poor working conditions could affect the resilience of basic services during crises, notably by causing high turnover.

Resistin is an immunomodulatory adipokine with elevated circulating levels in obese outpatients that could contribute to inflammatory kidney injury. We hypothesized that plasma resistin levels would be associated with AKI and BMI, and correlated with the inflammatory markers IL6 and MCP1 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 134 patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. Plasma samples were collected within 48 hours of admission and analyzed using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay, with biomarker levels expressed using normalized protein expression (NPX) values relative to common pooled control plasma. We tested the association of each biomarker with AKI, defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine and dialysis criteria, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as well as multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. Spearman's rho and correlation coefficients were calculated for the correlation of biomarker levels with each other. We used causal mediation models to investigate effects of BMI on AKI mediated by plasma resistin. Results: Of 134 patients enrolled, 43 (32.1%) developed AKI: 25 with stage 1, 5 with stage 2, and 13 with stage 3. Plasma resistin levels ranged from 5.26-13.01 NPX units and were strongly associated with AKI: odds ratio 2.13 (95% CI 1.43-3.17) per NPX unit. This association was diminished but remained significant after adjustment for age and APACHE III score (OR 1.69 (1.09-2.63)). Body mass index was higher in patients with AKI than without (median 31.4 (IQR 27.1-37.6) kg/m2 v. 28.3 (25.1-34.9) kg/m2, respectively), but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.082). There was no significant correlation of BMI with resistin levels (rho 0.05, p=0.562), and causal mediation models failed to detect significant mediation of BMI-AKI association through resistin.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential impact of this interruption. Methods: For seven of the NTDs, namely soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, visceral leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis, we use mathematical transmission models to assess the potential impact of the current disruption to programmes on the dynamics of each of these diseases in different endemic settings. We also explore the potential benefit of implementing mitigation strategies once restrictions are relaxed, both in minimising the delays to control targets and reducing longer-term morbidity. Findings: We demonstrate that the impact of the COVID-19 induced interruption in terms of delay to achieving elimination goals is likely to be greatest in those areas where NTD endemicity is highest. We also show that these delays can largely be mitigated by measures such as additional MDA or enhanced case-finding, and that the sooner these mitigation strategies are implemented, the greater the benefit in terms of long-term morbidity reduction. Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious disease control to the forefront of global consciousness. It is essential that the NTDs, so long neglected in terms of research and financial support, are not overlooked during the current crisis, and remain a priority in health service planning and funding.Funding Statement: This work was supported by the NTD Modelling Consortium, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1184344).

One of the objectives of screening and management is to have markers that can efficiently stratify the individual risk of experiencing adverse results. High-sensitivity troponin has been proposed as one of the possible prognostic markers. Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of troponin elevation and its performance for predicting 60-days mortality in patients in ICU due to COVID - 19 in a Latin American population. Methodology: A single-center retrospective cohort study was carried out in which patients in ICU for COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PC between May and December 2020 were included. Patients with previous conditions that determined a limitation of therapeutic effort and pregnant women were excluded. The outcome was 60-days mortality. Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed, a ROC curve was generated for the prediction of death according to troponin levels by calculating the area under the curve. Finally, a Cox proportional hazards model was generated. Results: 296 patients were included, 110 (37.2%) female, the mean age was 60 (SD 14) years and the duration of symptoms before admission to the ICU was 8.4 (SD 4.2) days. 81.4% of the patients had at least one comorbidity, 117 (39.5%) had hypertension, 65 (21.9%) had diabetes, and 63 (21.3%) had chronic lung disease. Mortality occurred in 151 cases (51%), 225 (76%) presented shock, 242 (81.8%) severe ARDS (PaO2 / FiO2 <100 mmHg), 232 (78.4%) required invasive ventilatory support, and 153 (5.7%) developed acute kidney injury. The APACHE II average was 13.1 and SOFA 4.8. Troponin was positive in 118 (39.9%) patients, 29.6% of the survivors and 49.7% in non survivors. The AUC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.59-0.71) for predicting mortality (Figure 1). The Kaplan Meier curves are shown in Figure 2 with a p less than 0.001 by achieving the test. In the bivariate analysis, troponin obtained a HR of 1.94 and p<0.001, but in the multivariate model it was 1.39 (95% CI of 0.21-1.56) and p of 0.12. Conclusions: High sensitivity troponin was found to be elevated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the intensive care unit who died, with regular discrimination (AUC: 0.65), even though the univariate analysis by the Cox and Kaplan Meier methods showed association with 60-days mortality, this was not maintained in the multivariate model.

TMH was originally conceived in 1932 as a philanthropic project by the Tatas, an elite Parsi business family in Bombay. The founding of TMH represented a form of philanthro-capitalism which both enabled the Tatas to foster a communal acceptance for big businesses in Bombay and provide the Tatas with the opportunity to place stakes in the emerging nuclear research economy seen as essential to the scientific nationalist sentiment of the post-colonial state. In doing this, the everyday activities of TMH placed a heavy emphasis on nuclear research. In a time when radium for the treatment of cancer was still seen as quackery in much of the world, the philanthro-capitalist investment and the interest in nuclear research by the post-colonial state provided an environment where radium medicine was able to be validated. The validation of radiotherapy at TMH influenced how other cancer hospitals in India developed and also provided significant resources for cancer research in early-mid twentieth century India. Ultimately, this article identifies ways in which cancer comes to be seen as relevant in the global south and raises questions on the relationship between local and global actors in setting health priorities.","output":"Emerging infrastructures: the politics of radium and the validation of radiotherapy in Indias first tertiary cancer hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp drop in carbon emissions in 2020. A recent example of the impact of sudden extreme events on carbon emissions occurred in the 2008 global financial crisis, in which carbon emissions droped in 2009, but jumped in 2010. This study is aimed to discuss how to prevent the retaliatory growth of carbon emissions post COVID-19 through learning the lessons from analysis of short-term and long-term drivers of carbon emissions. This study explored the short-term (annual) effects (population scale. affluence level, carbon intensity, energy intensity) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emissions in the world, different income groups and selected countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis using LMDI technique. In addition, this study explored the long-term effects (energy consumption per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, foreign direct investment, and trade openness) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emission in the world and different income groups from 1990 to 2014 using VAR technique. The decomposition results of short-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that the deterioration in energy efficiency (increase in energy intensity) was the main reason for the retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-2008 financial crisis, especially in high-income countries. The decomposition results of long-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that trade openness contributed to reduce carbon emission in the world and the incomes groups in the long term, although trade openness led to increase in carbon emission in developing countries in the short term. To prevent retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions, what we should learn two lessons from the decomposition of carbon emission: improving energy efficiency, and expanding trade openness. Unfortunately, energy efficiency has been neglected in the economic recovery plans to respond to COVID-19 of various countries, especially developed countries, and worse, trade protectionism is on the rise, especially in developed countries. Therefore, we are pessimistic about preventing a retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-COVID-19 for now.","output":"Preventing carbon emission retaliatory rebound post-COVID-19 requires expanding free trade and improving energy efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Montelukast can be effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Montelukast's ability to fight COVID-19 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote work is undoubtedly on the rise, especially as companies adapt to the changing times of COVID-19, but what impact will this have on the broader economy?

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of the rule-induced physical demands between soccer, futsal, basketball, and handball, focusing on substitution rules. Data from the elite team sports rules (e.g., absolute and relative court dimensions; the number of players, substitutions allowed, total game time, time-outs) were collected, including the changes due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in soccer substitutions, and comparisons were performed. The data showed that soccer has higher rule-induced physical demands: e.g., substantially lower substitution rate, higher dimensions in absolute (eight to fifteen times), and relative (four to eight times) values. Simulations also showed that soccer has extremely large differences, even considering COVID-19 substitution changes (from three to up to five). We conclude that elite soccer has remarkably higher overall rule-induced physical demands than elite futsal, basketball and handball, and increasing soccer substitutions permanently (e.g., unlimited) might mitigate overall soccer demands.","output":"Is It High Time to Increase Elite Soccer Substitutions Permanently?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development and deployment of biosensors for the rapid detection of the 2019 novel severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of utmost importance and urgency during this recent outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which spread rapidly around the world.

Soil samples from four sites among the penicillin G production plant were analysed using 16S rRNA profiling via Illumina MiSeq platform and were compared with the control samples from four sites outside the plant. Total metagenomic DNA from the impacted soil was also used for the preparation of E. coli T1R-based fosmid library which was consequently qualitatively tested for the presence of penicillin G acylase (PGA)-encoding genes using the method of sequence homology. Analyses of alpha diversity revealed that the long-term antibiotic presence in the soil significantly increased the microbial diversity and richness in terms of Shannon diversity index (p = 0.002) and Chao estimates (p = 0.004). Principal component analysis showed that the two types of communities (on-site and control) could be separated at the phylum, class and genus level. The on-site soil was enriched in Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetia, while a significant decrease in Actinobacteria was observed.

After 28 days, PM provoked severe gastric ulceration and marked liver and kidney damage indicated by an elevated gastric ulcer index and considerable alteration in liver and kidney biochemical tests. The toxic effects might be attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction and excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as indicated by enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels along with decreased reduced-glutathione (GSH) levels and catalase (CAT) activity. Apoptotic cell death also was demonstrated by increased regulation of activated caspase-3 in the stomach, liver, and kidney tissues.

When COVID-19 is severe, it can cause pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and can progress to viremia involving multiple organ systems. It causes significant cytopenia, mainly severe lymphopenia, and excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in an immunocompromised state and cytokine storm. Furthermore, COVID-19 can commonly be complicated with acute thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism, acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, clotting of hemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) catheters, and acute limb ischemia. This makes SARS-COV-2 a unique virus with an undiscovered pathophysiology. Therefore, patients with COVID-19 need close monitoring of their symptoms and laboratory parameters, and early hospitalization and treatment in severe cases. Early identification of severe cases and the abovementioned complications of COVID-19 could decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease.

However, aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccines remains poorly characterized, and its ability to induce mucosal immunity in humans is unknown. This phase Ib trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of human serotype-5 Ad-vectored tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (AdHu5Ag85A) delivered to humans via inhaled aerosol or i.m. injection. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy, previously BCG-vaccinated adults were enrolled. AdHu5Ag85A was administered by single-dose aerosol using Aeroneb Solo Nebulizer or by i.m. injection. The study consisted of the low-dose (LD) aerosol, high-dose (HD) aerosol, and i.m. groups. The adverse events were assessed at various times after vaccination. Immunogenicity data were collected from the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples at baseline, as well as at select time points after vaccination. RESULTS: The nebulized aerosol droplets were < 5.39 m in size. Both LD and HD of AdHu5Ag85A administered by aerosol inhalation and i.m. injection were safe and well tolerated. Both aerosol doses, particularly LD, but not i.m., vaccination markedly induced airway tissueCresident memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of polyfunctionality. While as expected, i.m. vaccination induced Ag85A-specific T cell responses in the blood, the LD aerosol vaccination also elicited such T cells in the blood. Furthermore, the LD aerosol vaccination induced persisting transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages. CONCLUSION: Inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccine is a safe and superior way to elicit respiratory mucosal immunity. This study warrants further development of aerosol vaccine strategies against respiratory pathogens, including TB and COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02337270.

Socio-demographic characteristics, health-related awareness, knowledge of HPV, motivation, and behavioral skills toward HPV vaccination were assessed using questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the influencing factors of willingness to receive the HPV vaccine in the next 6 months. RESULTS: Among the 3867 students invited to participate in this study, 102 (2.64%) reported having taken the HPV vaccine. Among the unvaccinated participants, 59.89% had previously heard of HPV, and 32.08% were willing to take the HPV vaccine in the next 6 months. Willingness to get the HPV vaccine was associated with sexual experience(s) (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.25C3.08), family or friends with cancer (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04C1.48), having heard of HPV (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03C1.47), and having actively searched for or having consulted on issues concerning HPV vaccine (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02C1.45).

Methods: All patients of age 16 years who underwent surgery for elbow trauma at the local trauma unit between March 2015 to Aug 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Identified cohort was invited to self-assess their elbow range of motion (ROM) using questionnaire with image instruction. They were then followed up with a clinical review for objective measurements by the lead clinician. Independent T-test was used to compare the measurements between patients and clinician. The power of the study was calculated using G?Power software. Results: Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the study with mean age of 41 years. 11 of 35 patients had an associated elbow fracture dislocation associated. Mean patient reported total ROM was 105.7  32.8, with mean extension of 24.6  18.9 to mean flexion of 130.3  18.2.

Can one anticipate such a spread and allow healthcare administrators to prepare for a surge a priori? We posit that the answer lies in distinguishing between two types of waves in epidemic dynamics. The first kind resembles a spatio-temporal diffusion pattern. Its gradual spread allows administrators to marshal resources to combat the epidemic. The second kind is caused by super-spreader events, which provide shocks to the disease propagation dynamics. Such shocks simultaneously affect a large geographical region and leave little time for the healthcare system to respond. <br><br>Methods: We use time-series analysis and epidemiological model estimation to detect and react to such simultaneous waves using COVID-19 data from the time when the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus dominated the spread.

We show that a multi-area compartmental epidemiological model does not fit such shock-induced disease dynamics well, in contrast to its performance with diffusion-type spread. The insufficient fit to infection data can be detected in the early stages of a shock-wave propagation and can be used as an early warning sign, providing valuable time for a planned healthcare response. Our analysis of COVID-19 infections in the US reveals that simultaneous waves due to super-spreader events in one country (India) can lead to simultaneous waves in other places. The US wave in the summer of 2021 does not fit a diffusion pattern either. We postulate that international travels from India caused this wave. To support that hypothesis, we demonstrate that countries with a high Indian diaspora exhibit infection growth soon after India's second wave, compared to countries with a low Indian diaspora.<br><br>Conclusions: Based on our data analysis, we provide concrete policy recommendations at various stages of a simultaneous wave, including how to avoid it, how to detect it quickly after a potential super-spreader event occurs, and how to proactively contain its spread.","output":"Not All Covid-19 Waves are Similar: Origins, Detection and Mitigation Strategies for Simultaneous Waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the recent epidemic outbreaks in the world have as a trigger, a strong migratory component as has been evident in the recent Covid-19 pandemic.

Our model postulates a general contact rate that represents a local measure of several factors: the population size of infected hosts that arrive at a given location as a function of total population size, the current incidence at neighboring locations, and the connectivity of the network where the disease spreads. This parameter can be interpreted as an indicator of outbreak risk at a given location. This parameter is tied to the fraction of individuals that move across boundaries (migration).

Statistical analyses included tests for between-group differences and Pearson correlations. The qualitative study entailed in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted by telephone (N=38). RESULTS: The quantitative findings indicate that about 48% of the public had negative emotional reactions and 20% perceived they were liable to contract the virus.

Currently, data coming from the following European countries has been successfully integrated: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Sweden. The knowledge base is automatically being updated, and it is available to the public through a SPARQL endpoint and a direct download link. Furthermore, we showcase how data integration enables spatio-temporal data analysis and knowledge discovery, by means of meaningful queries that would not be feasible to process otherwise.","output":"Towards Integrated and Open COVID-19 Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Polyneuropathy is a generalized disease of the peripheral nervous system and is most commonly caused by diabetes and alcohol abuse. However, the cause often remains unknown, so that only symptomatic treatment is available. The pain is treated with moderate success, which leads to unsatisfactory treatment results, which also limits the patient's quality of life. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) could be a way to successfully treat polyneuropathy, improve its symptoms and enhance the quality of life of patients. Methods: 12 patients were included in the study and treated with a combination of Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxa, Qi Gong, dietetics, Japanese overheating bath and lentil bath at the Klinik am Steigerwald in Germany for an average of three weeks. Sensitivity in six skin areas, motor function, reflexes and anamnestic parameters including pain were examined before and 15 weeks after therapy. In addition, the quality of life of the patients was assessed at both times using SF-36. Results: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 10 patients could be completed. Pain decreased significantly in 7 of 8 patients (p=0.014). A significant improvement (p=0.006) of hypaesthesia was observed in the area of the feet. The sensation of cold was restored in at least one segment in 6 patients (60%), the sensation of warmth in 5 patients (50%) and in 50% at least 3 improvements in touch sensation were observed. The patients' quality of life was also improved by the therapy concept. A significant improvement was achieved in the area of physical function (p=0.009). Conclusion: The data suggest that there is a positive effect of TCM in idiopathic polyneuropathy. It has been shown that the multimodal concept of TCM can be clinically useful in polyneuropathy patients who have not responded to conventional pharmaceutical therapies.

It is a strong irritant and considered a weak sensitizer. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend of BAK sensitization and the demographics of sensitized patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 7390 patients who were patch tested with BAK between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Of the 7390 patients who were patch tested to BAK, 108 (1.5%) had a positive reaction, with 21 reactions deemed clinically relevant (0.3% of total patch tested) and a further 5 doubtful reactions deemed clinically relevant, resulting in a total of 26 relevant reactions (0.4% of total patch tested). Common sources of exposure were ophthalmic drops (30.8%), topical antiseptic preparations (26.9%), cosmetics (15.4%), disinfectant solutions (11.5%), hand sanitizers (11.5%), and hand washes (7.7%). One fifth of patients with relevant reactions were health care workers. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of positive reactions since 2017, for reasons not totally clear.

We retrospectively examined the effects of cryoprecipitate on the increase in fibrinogen levels in patients with excessive intraoperative blood loss. METHODS: Ninety-seven patients who were administered cryoprecipitate during surgery between June 2014 and May 2019 were enrolled in our study and categorized according to the volume of intraoperative blood loss as follows: group A, 2000-5000 mL; group B, 5000-10,000 mL; group C, > 10,000 mL. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and electronic anesthesia records. The primary endpoint was an increase in the fibrinogen level after the administration of cryoprecipitate. RESULTS: Nine patients with no fibrinogen data and four patients with a bleeding volume of less than 2000 mL were excluded; thus, 84 patients (A: n = 36, B: n = 37, C: n = 11) were evaluated. The mean intraoperative blood loss (mL) in groups A, B, and C were 3348  791, 6688  1225, and 14,281  5142, respectively. The fibrinogen levels (mg/dL) before cryoprecipitate administration in groups A, B, and C were 189  94, 113  42, and 83  29, respectively (p < 0.05 among the groups). The increase in fibrinogen level (mg/dL) after cryoprecipitate administration in group C was significantly greater than that in group A (84  34 versus 50  36, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the effect of cryoprecipitate on the increase in fibrinogen level was most apparent in patients with excessive intraoperative blood loss  10,000 mL. In addition, most patients with intraoperative blood loss  5000 mL had fibrinogen levels < 150 mg/dL which improved to  150 mg/dL after cryoprecipitate administration in approximately 70% of patients. Therefore, cryoprecipitate administration should be considered for patients with hypofibrinogenemia ( 150 mg/dL) experiencing severe bleeding (e.g.,  5000 mL) and rapid administration of cryoprecipitate is necessary to maximize the hemostatic effect, especially when the bleeding volume exceeds 10,000 ml.","output":"Effect of cryoprecipitate on an increase in fibrinogen level in patients with excessive intraoperative blood loss: a single-center retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) possess mutations that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies within the Spike protein and are associated with breakthrough infection and reinfection. By contrast, less is known about the escape from CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity by VOC. Here, we demonstrated that VOCs retain similar MHC-I downregulation capacity compared to the ancestral virus. However, VOCs exhibit a greater ability to suppress type I IFN than the ancestral virus. Although VOCs possess unique mutations within the ORF8 gene, which suppresses MHC-I expression, none of these mutations enhanced the ability of ORF8 to suppress MHC-I expression. Notably, MHC-I upregulation was strongly inhibited after the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 already possesses an intrinsically potent MHC-I evasion capacity, and that further adaptation by the variants was not observed.

When weaponized, it can cause inhalation anthrax, the deadliest form of the disease. Due to the rapid course of inhalation anthrax, delays in initiation of antibiotics may decrease survival chances. Because a rapid response would require cooperation from the public, there is a need to understand the public's response to possible mass dispensing programs. To examine the public's response to a mass prophylaxis program, this study used a nationally representative poll of 1,092 adults, supplemented by a targeted focus on 3 metropolitan areas where anthrax attacks occurred in 2001: New York City (n=517), Washington, DC (n=509), and Trenton/Mercer County, NJ (n=507). The poll was built around a \\"worst-case scenario\\" in which cases of inhalation anthrax are discovered without an identified source and the entire population of a city or town is asked to receive antibiotic prophylaxis within a 48-hour period. Findings from this poll provide important signs of public willingness to comply with public health recommendations for obtaining antibiotics from a dispensing site, although they also indicate that public health officials may face several challenges to compliance, including misinformation about the contagiousness of inhalation anthrax; fears about personal safety in crowds; distrust of government agencies to provide sufficient, safe, and effective medicine; and hesitation about ingesting antibiotic pills after receiving them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An online survey was sent to women whose ART cycles were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak between April and May 2020. The study population were 101 participants. The main outcome measure is to determine the levels of fear and anxiety in infertile women by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T and STAI-S) and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). The relationship of the COVID-19 outbreak with the willingness to go ahead with the desire for pregnancy was also assessed. RESULTS The state-anxiety levels were significantly higher in women above 35 years (45.0  5.2 vs. 42.2  4.5, p = 0.006). Women with diminished ovarian reserve had a higher state-anxiety compared to other causes, but were not found to be significant (44.7  5.2 vs. 42.5  5.0, p = 0.173). Women who thought that the possibility of not being able to get pregnant was more important than being infected with the COVID-19 had higher anxiety levels than women who thought just the opposite. The diminished ovarian reserve and high duration of infertility were found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (OR = 2.5, p < 0.05). The diminished ovarian reserve and previous ART failure significantly predicted the presence of clinical state-anxiety. CONCLUSION The state-anxiety was found to be higher in women whose cycles were postponed due to the outbreak and the presence of diminished ovarian reserve also significantly affected anxiety levels.

METHODS: A retrospective comparative study of ophthalmic emergency presentations to Campbelltown Hospital (fifth busiest NSW metropolitan ED; population 310,000) and Bowral and District Hospital (rural ED; population 48,000) before and during COVID-19 was conducted. Patient demographics, triage category, referral source, diagnosis, length of stay, departure status, and follow-up location were assessed from coding data between March 1st to May 31st in 2019 and 2020, corresponding to the peak case numbers and restrictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in NSW. Differences before and during COVID-19 were analysed using chi-squared tests or independent sample t-tests. RESULTS: There was no change in ophthalmic presentations at Campbelltown (n = 228 in 2019 vs. n = 232 in 2020; + 1.75%, p = 0.12) and an increase at Bowral (n = 100 in 2019 vs. n = 111 in 2020; + 11%, p < 0.01) during COVID-19.

However, no scientific evidence has been reported on the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on traffic incident duration, a key metric for crash management. It is also unclear from the existing literature whether the impacts on traffic incidents are consistent across multiple lockdowns. This paper analyses the impact of two different COVID-19 lockdowns in Sydney, Australia, on traffic incident duration and frequency. During the first (31 MarchC28 April 2020) and second (26 JuneC31 August 2021) lockdowns, the number of incidents fell by 50% and 60%, respectively, in comparison to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The proportion of incidents involving towing increased significantly during both lockdowns. The mean duration of crashes increased by 16% during the first lockdown, but the change was less significant during the subsequent lockdown. Crashes involving diversions, emergency services and towing saw an increase in the mean duration by 67%, 16%, and 47%, respectively, during the first lockdown. However, this was not reflected in the 2021 data, with only major crashes seeing a significant increase, i.e., by 58%. There was also a noticeable shift in the location of incidents, with more incidents recorded in suburban areas, away from the central business area. Our findings suggest drastic changes in incident characteristics, and these changes should be considered by policymakers in promoting a safer and more sustainable transportation network in the future.","output":"A Descriptive Analysis on the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Road Traffic Incidents in Sydney, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within Wuhan, China. As the crisis of its severe, increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital excellent changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 January 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance ISA's performance and avoid the trapping in the local optima. This methodology is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices, including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated on the most affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather than the other algorithms while forecasting the candidate countries task. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"COVID-19 Forecasting Based on an Improved Interior Search Algorithm and Multilayer Feed-Forward Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive impairment is a frequent complaint in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and can be related to cortical hypometabolism on 18F-FDG PET at the subacute stage. However, it is unclear if these changes are reversible. Methods: We prospectively assessed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and 18F-FDG PET scans in 8 COVID-19 patients at the subacute (as no longer infectious) and chronic stages (approximately six months after symptom onset). The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related covariance pattern was analyzed at both stages to examine the time course of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. For further validation, we also conducted a conventional group analysis. Results: Follow-up 18F-FDG PET revealed a significant reduction of initial frontoparietal and, to a lesser extent, temporal glucose hypometabolism that was accompanied by a significant improvement in cognition. The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related pattern was significantly lower at follow-up and correlated inversely with MoCA performance. However, both 18F-FDG PET and cognitive assessment suggest a residual impairment. Conclusions: Although a significant recovery of regional neuronal function and cognition can be clearly stated, residuals are still measurable in some patients six months after the manifestation of COVID-19. Given the current pandemic situation and tremendous uncertainty concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19, the present study provides novel insights of highest medical and socioeconomic relevance.","output":"Slow but evident recovery from neocortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment in a series of chronic COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Opioids and stimulants are the most commonly injected illicit drugs worldwide and in Australia. While some people who inject drugs (PWID) prefer either opioids or stimulants, others regularly use both opioids and stimulants. Limited available research indicates that those who use opioids and stimulants together, either in combination or alternating between the two, may engage in injection-related practices which potentially place them at greater health risk and could lead to poorer health outcomes. METHODS: Participants were recruited nationally through member organizations of the Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League (AIVL); these organizations represent PWID in each Australian state and territory. This study compared a sample of PWID (N = 535) who reported past-month injection of opioids only (N = 173), stimulants only (N = 208), or both (N = 154) on a range of health and wellbeing outcomes. PWID completed a survey assessing drugs injected, frequency of injecting, receptive equipment sharing, psychological distress, self-reported hepatitis C (HCV) status, experienced and internalized stigma, drug use salience, and community attachment. RESULTS: People who injected both opioids and stimulants reported more frequent injecting, more experiences of stigma, and greater reported HCV diagnosis than people who injected stimulants or opioids alone. They also showed greater attachment to a community of PWID and greater salience of drug use to their identity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of increased injecting and broader harms associated with injecting both stimulants and opioids are important for tailoring harm reduction and intervention designs for people who use both opioid and stimulant drugs, including prioritizing peer-based approaches.","output":"Addressing injecting related risks among people who inject both opioids and stimulants: Findings from an Australian survey of people who inject drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic hyperinflammation disease which can cause severe respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary manifestations.

Antibiotics are essential commodities in managing bacterial infections in humans, animals and plants but are hampered by the development of antibiotic resistance which is one of the most serious public health threats of the twenty-first century. Moreover, the rate at which novel antibiotics are discovered is slower that the rate of emerging antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the few remaining potent antibiotics in clinical setting should be safeguarded by closer monitoring of their effectiveness via periodic antibiogram studies. This study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of routinely isolated bacteria at Livingstone Central Hospital (LCH). Methods. A cohort retrospective study with secondary information collected from electronic laboratory system generated reports on all isolated organisms at LCH microbiology laboratory for three years (January 2019 to December 2021) was used. Study variables such as age, gender, patients location, name of the organism and the antibiotic susceptibility were considered. Descriptive statistics was used to describe our data and a chi-square test was used for categorical variables where a p-value of <=0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results . A total of 765 specimens were processed from January 2019 to December 2021 and only 500 (65.4%) met the inclusion criteria for this study. Of the 500, 291(58.2%) specimens were received from female and from the age-group 17-39 years (253, 50.6%) and 40-80 years (145, 29%) in form of blood (331, 66.2%), urine (165, 33%) and sputum (4, 0.8%). The out-patient department (323, 64.6%) had a higher number of specimen culture requests that reduced from 175 (35%) for the year 2019 and 2020 to 150 (30%) for year 2021. Amongst the common bacterial isolates identified, Staphylococcus aureus (142, 28.4%) was the commonest isolate followed by Escherichia coli (91, 18.2%), Enterobacter agglomerans (76, 15.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (43, 8.6%). The resistance pattern indicated that ampicillin (93%) was the least effective drug followed by oxacillin (88%), penicillin (85.6%), co-trimoxazole (81.5%), erythromycin (71.9%), nalidixic acid (68%), ceftazidime (60%), tetracycline (55.1%), and ciprofloxacin (45.9%) whereas the most effective antibiotics were imipenem (14.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (16.7%) and clindamycin (34.5%). The resistance levels were affected by patient gender, location, and specimen type. However, the screening of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with cefoxitin showed 76.3% (29/38) susceptibility and 23.7% (9/38) resistance. Conclusion . The commonest bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. The least effective antibiotics were ampicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin whereas the most effective antibiotics were imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin. Therefore, re-establishing of the empiric therapy is needed for proper patient management, studies to determine the levels of extended spectrum beta lactamase- and carbapenemase- producing bacteria are warranted.","output":"Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from laboratory specimens at Livingstone Central Hospital in Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cas13a has been used to target RNA viruses in cell culture, but efficacy has not been demonstrated in animal models.

Although many studies have empirically investigated the influence of oil prices on economic growth and Covid-19 on oil prices. However, the current study contributes to the literature by investigating the causal linkage of natural resources commodity prices and economic growth in the pre and post Covid-19 period for China over the period from January 01, 2019, to April 01, 2021. This study employed the wavelet power spectrum, and the wavelet coherence approaches, and the frequency domain causality test, which is known for the causal identification in the long-run, medium-run, and short-run. The empirical findings reveal that the natural resource commodity prices are more vulnerable than the economic performance particularly in the Covid-19 peak period in China. However, the wavelet coherence approach demonstrates that a bidirectional causal association exists between natural resources commodity prices and economic performance at different frequencies and time periods. Additionally, the frequency domain causality test confirms that the natural resource commodity prices volatility significantly causes economic performance only in the medium-run. Based on the empirical findings, this study recommends that innovative technological and precautionary measures must be taken to accommodate or overcome natural disasters in the future, and tackle natural resources commodity prices volatility.","output":"Natural resources commodity prices volatility and economic performance: Evidence from China pre and post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: In 2018, only half of US women obtained all evidence-based cancer screenings.

Objective: To evaluate optimal screening strategies in women who obtain some, but not all, US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)-recommended cancer screenings. Design, Setting, and Participants: This modeling study was conducted from January 31, 2017, to July 20, 2020, and used 4 validated mathematical models from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network using data from 20 million simulated women born in 1965 in the US. Interventions: Forty-five screening strategies were modeled that combined breast, cervical, colorectal, and/or lung cancer (LC) screenings; restricted to 1, 2, 3 or 4 screenings per year; or all eligible screenings once every 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Modeled life-years gained from restricted cancer screenings as a fraction of those attainable from full compliance with USPSTF recommendations (maximum benefits). Results were stratified by LC screening eligibility (LC-eligible/ineligible). We repeated the analysis with 2018 adherence rates, evaluating the increase in adherence required for restricted screenings to have the same population benefit as USPSTF recommendations. Results: This modeling study of 20 million simulated US women found that it was possible to reduce screening intensity to 1 carefully chosen test per year in women who were ineligible for LC screening and 2 tests per year in eligible women while maintaining 94% or more of the maximum benefits. Highly ranked strategies screened for various cancers, but less often than recommended by the USPSTF. For example, among LC-ineligible women who obtained just 1 screening per year, the optimal strategy frequently delayed breast and cervical cancer screenings by 1 year and skipped 3 mammograms entirely. Among LC-eligible women, LC screening was essential; strategies omitting it provided 25% or less of the maximum benefits. The top-ranked strategy restricted to 2 screenings per year was annual LC screening and alternating fecal immunochemical test with mammography (skipping mammograms when due for cervical cancer screening, 97% of maximum benefits). If adherence in a population of LC-eligible women obtaining 2 screenings per year were to increase by 1% to 2% (depending on the screening test), this model suggests that it would achieve the same benefit as USPSTF recommendations at 2018 adherence rates. Conclusions and Relevance: This modeling study of 45 cancer screening strategies suggests that women who are noncompliant with cancer screening guidelines may be able to reduce USPSTF-recommended screening intensity with minimal reduction in overall benefits.","output":"Modeling Strategies to Optimize Cancer Screening in USPSTF Guideline-Noncompliant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case report - Introduction This is the case of an adolescent referred to rheumatology following 5 years of back pain. After years of trying a number of treatments without much success, the cause was found to be a previously undiagnosed urological pathology. The case highlights awareness of non-rheumatological causes and incidental findings which can redirect a patient towards more appropriate treatment and reduce the potential for long-term adverse health issues and anxiety. Case report - Case description B was referred age 16 to rheumatology with a 5-year history of lower back pain. She had previously seen paediatricians with symptoms initially attributed to constipation due to intermittent straining and hard stool. However, constipation remedies had not relieved the pain which progressed gradually to a more persistent dull ache with impact on daily activities. Various analgesics (including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), exercises and acupuncture had not helped. There was no history of recurrent urinary tract infections or symptom correlation with fluid intake, menstruation or bowel habit. No inflammatory features or connective tissue disease symptoms were noted and family history was unremarkable Clinical examination was normal apart from mild tenderness in the lumbar region. Rheumatoid factor was borderline positive (15 iu/mL) with the rest of blood tests normal including renal function, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), anti CCP and ANA. She had minimal microscopic haematuria without proteinuria. MRI spine in 2015 was normal. In view of her young age and symptoms affecting daily activities, STIR sequence spinal MRI was requested. This excluded any new or old inflammatory changes but incidentally identified a dilated left pelvi-calyceal system. Renal ultrasound confirmed a grossly hydronephrotic left kidney with hydroureter and minimal renal tissue suggesting longstanding obstruction. No calculi were seen. The patient was referred to urologists. Further investigations (including MRI abdomen) confirmed similar findings and a distal ureteric stricture. A MAG 3 renogram showed a normal right kidney but only 12% functioning of the left kidney. Urologists have advised surgery (removal of left kidney and ureter) which may relieve symptoms or a conservative non-surgical approach (continue analgesia, physiotherapy and monitoring). The patient and her family are relieved to have a possible cause identified and are considering the surgical option due to ongoing flank discomfort. Case report - Discussion This was an interesting finding of hydroureter and hydronephrosis causing longstanding back pain presenting to rheumatologists. Until completion of the spondyloarthropathy protocol MRI (STIR images), aetiology had been unclear. Hydronephrosis and hydroureter has no specific age or racial predilection. Signs and symptoms may depend on whether obstruction is acute/chronic. Chronic cases may be asymptomatic or present as a dull discomfort (like this case). Some cases may only present in adulthood with pain precipitated by fluid intake. Blood tests may show impaired kidney function. Post-mortem studies suggest 50% of people have at least one renal abnormality (e.g., renal cysts, duplex ureters) with autopsy series incidence of hydronephrosis reported as 3.1%. Causes include anatomical abnormalities such as vesico-ureteric reflux, urethral strictures (usually present in childhood), calculi, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or intrapelvic neoplasms, pregnancy and infections (e.g., TB). Sudden onset unilateral renomegaly was reported in one case of primary Sjogrens with lymphocytic interstitial nephritis and positive Sjogrens autoantibodies. Our patient has no clinical or serological evidence of connective tissue disease. Minor pelvi-calyceal distension can occur as a normal finding in well-hydrated patients and pregnancy. However, significant hydronephrosis requires assessment to determine cause as it may affect long term renal function. Imaging via computed tomography ultrasound and urograms can help guide further management. In this case the preceding cause and duration of pathology is unknown. Sterile, giant hydronephrosis treatment options include observation and ureteric stent or nephrostomy in patients unfit for surgery. Nephrectomy is advised for pain and recurrent infection in a non-functioning kidney. Complications may include bowel perforation, vascular injury and urine leakage. Both open and minimally invasive procedures have good reported outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic and exams have affected timing of any elective procedures and the patient understands surgery may or may not offer complete symptom resolution. Case report - Key learning points Non-inflammatory causes of back pain should always be considered in cases of persistent back pain, particularly in young people to ascertain if there is a treatable cause Hydronephrosis cases can be asymptomatic or present with vague, intermittent, non-specific abdominal symptoms with normal physical examination with or without haematuria. This can cause diagnostic uncertainty and delay referral to urology and appropriate renal investigations Assessment of renal function (including MAG 3 renogram) is important to guide further management Surgical interventions (pyeloplasty/nephrectomy) may ease symptoms long term but there is no guarantee of a successful outcome and operative risks need to be considered too Left undiagnosed, potentially this patient could have had further disruption to daily activities and both physical and mental well being","output":"Finding an answer for an adolescent with back pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHODS: The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sant study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 48% (95% CI 24-80, n=341). The estimate increased to 85% (59-114, n=469) in the second week, to 109% (79-144, n=577) in the third week, 66% (43-94, n=604) in the fourth week, and 108% (82-139, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5-9 years (relative risk [RR] 032 [95% CI 011-063]) and those older than 65 years (RR 050 [028-078]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20-49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 116 infections in the community. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <25 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5-9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10-64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

To respond to these increasing risks of disastrous outbreaks, the government began integrating One Health (OH) into its infectious disease response systems in 2011 to strengthen its preparedness and contain outbreaks. The strong performance of Rwanda in responding to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic makes it an excellent example to understand how the structure and principles of OH were applied during this unprecedented situation. METHODS: A rapid environmental scan of published and grey literature was conducted between August and December 2020, to assess Rwandas OH structure and its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 132 documents including official government documents, published research, newspaper articles, and policies were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Rwandas OH structure consists of multidisciplinary teams from sectors responsible for human, animal, and environmental health. The country has developed OH strategic plans and policies outlining its response to zoonotic infections, integrated OH into university curricula to develop a OH workforce, developed multidisciplinary rapid response teams, and created decentralized laboratories in the animal and human health sectors to strengthen surveillance. To address COVID-19, the country created a preparedness and response plan before its onset, and a multisectoral joint task force was set up to coordinate the response to the pandemic. By leveraging its OH structure, Rwanda was able to rapidly implement a OH-informed response to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Rwandas integration of OH into its response systems to infectious diseases and to COVID-19 demonstrates the importance of applying OH principles into the governance of infectious diseases at all levels.

Early data have demonstrated how the host response to this novel coronavirus leads to the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, massive endothelial damage, and generalized vascular manifestations. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, other organ systems are also affected. SARS-CoV-2 relies on 2 host cell receptors for successful attachment: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2. Clinicopathologic reports have demonstrated associations between severe COVID-19 and viral coagulopathy, resulting in pulmonary embolism; venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis; lung endothelial injury; and associated thrombotic complications leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Viral coagulopathy is not novel given similar observations with SARS classic, including the consumption of platelets, generation of thrombin, and increased fibrin degradation product exhibiting overt disseminated intravascular coagulationClike syndrome. The specific mechanism(s) behind the thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients has yet to be fully understood. Parenteral anticoagulants, such as heparin and low-molecular-weights heparins, are widely used in the management of COVID-19 patients. Beyond the primary (anticoagulant) effects of these agents, they may exhibit antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects. Direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also useful in the management of these patients. Tissue plasminogen activator and other fibrinolytic modalities may also be helpful in the overall management. Catheter-directed thrombolysis can be used in patients developing pulmonary embolism. Further investigations are required to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated thrombotic complications.","output":"Viral Coagulopathy in Patients With COVID-19: Treatment and Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 49-year-old woman developed COVID-19 infection during treatment with palbociclib for invasive ductal breast carcinoma The woman was diagnosed with de-novo, estrogen receptors/progesterone receptors-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative, grade 2 invasive ductal breast carcinoma with liver metastases in 2019 She started receiving treatment with palbociclib 125mg daily [route not stated] concomitantly with goserelin and letrozole on days 1-21 every 28 days After the initiation of palbociclib therapy, her average neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were found to be reduced Her medical history was significant for multiple drug allergies to various antibiotics, positive family history for lupus, and she had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 4 years prior to the current presentation During late March 2020, she presented to the emergency department with 4 days of fever, nausea and weakness On presentation, she was found to be stable Blood count revealed mild leucopenia and moderate neutropenia of 1 1 Additionally, a real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab showed positive results for COVID-19 infection The woman was hospitalised On admission day 1, her therapy with palbociclib was stopped During her hospital stay, she suffered from fevers of up to 39 4C, which persisted for 9 days along with worsening dyspnoea, which developed on admission day 5 Follow-up blood tests revealed normalisation of the neutrophilia and leucopenia However, lymphopenia occurred along with elevated CRP Due to the prolonged course of disease in a presumed immunosuppressed state, chest X-ray performed on admission day 8 revealed new bilateral basal infiltrates On admission day 11, non-contrast whole-body CT scan showed bilateral pulmonary multifocal peripheral ground glass opacities and consolidations Based on these findings, COVID-19 infection secondary to the palbociclib therapy was considered On admission days 12-14, short term desaturation of as low as 88% on room air was noted, which was resolved by oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula After a gradual improvement of symptoms during 15 days hospital stay followed by two negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests, she was discharged home in good general condition for further ambulatory medical care","output":"Palbociclib"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many put their hopes in the rapid availability of effective immunizations. Human milk, containing antibodies against syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may serve as means of protection through passive immunization. We aimed to determine the presence and pseudovirus neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19, and the effect of pasteurization on these antibodies. METHODS: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Human milk and serum samples were collected. To assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (specific for IgA and IgG), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG in serum, and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for specific Ig (IgG, IgM and IgA in human milk and serum). To assess the effect of pasteurization, human milk was exposed to Holder (HoP) and High Pressure Pasteurization (HPP). RESULTS: Human milk contained abundant SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 83% of the proven cases and in 67% of the suspected cases. Unpasteurized milk with and without these antibodies was found to be capable of neutralizing a pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 in (97% and 85% of the samples respectively). After pasteurization, total IgA antibody levels were affected by HoP, while SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels were affected by HPP. Pseudovirus neutralizing capacity of the human milk samples was only retained with the HPP approach. No correlation was observed between milk antibody levels and neutralization capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Human milk from recovered COVID-19-infected mothers contains SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies which maintained neutralization capacity after HPP.

All research was set in the context of a crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of the study is to present the research methodology that considers the proprietary three-stage research procedure. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research presented in the article was conducted at a university in Poland. Research methods characteristic of the social sciences were used, including analytical methods and a diagnostic survey. As a research tool, questionnaire forms consisting of questions about the impact of remote work on the psychosocial safety of respondents were used. In addition, the research used the MICMAC program, with the help of which the relationships between selected factors were analyzed. Findings: The most important factors from the perspective of psychosocial safety of employees participating in the study are workload, organization of time between work and household chores, work outside of designated hours, time pressure, professional communication with colleagues, stress, technical supplies, and a sense of independence. The obtained results are only an example and illustrate the adopted research procedure. The research methodology presented in three steps is the achievement of the study. Practical Implications: The presented research results indicate on which aspects of the organization of professional tasks the analyzed organization should focus on to provide its employees with the highest possible level of psychosocial safety in remote work conditions. Purposeful and targeted activities in this area allow the organization to reduce the negative consequences of psychosocial occupational hazards (such as e.g., employee absenteeism), and the available research results show a positive impact of such activities on work efficiency and on shaping a positive and resilient organizational culture. Originality/Value: This research changes the commonly functioning approach to the perception of threats while working remotely only in terms of ergonomic, economic, and legal conditions. In the opinion of the authors, the methodology of identifying the key factors of psychosocial safety during remote work is universal and can be used in any organization and in any conditions, although it is especially dedicated to crisis situations that generate additional tension.","output":"Identification of Key Psychosocial Safety Factors when Working Remotely: A Three-Step Research Methodology Proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the frequencies of 3 types of hospital revisits by patients after treatment for COVID-19 in the emergency department.;MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who came to the emergency department in March and April 2020 and were discharged alive with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Baseline and acute episode data were collected and the patients were followed for 1 year. We analyzed variables associated with revisits for any reason, revisits related to COVID-19, and early COVID-19-related revisits (within 30 days).;RESULTS: A total of 1352 patients with a mean age of 62.1 years (52.9% male) were studied. A total of 553 revisits were made by 342 patients (25.3%) for any reason;132 (9.8%) revisited in relation to COVID-19 at least once. Of those, 103 (7.6%) revisited within 30 days (early) and 29 (2.2%) came later. COVID-19-related revisits were associated with thrombotic events (odds ratio [OR], 7.58;95% CI, 1.75-32.81) and pulmonary fibrosis (OR, 4.95;95% CI, 1.27-19.24);early revisits were inversely associated with follow-up management by a contracted health care support service (OR, 0.18;95% CI, 0.03-0.92). Hospital admission during the initial visit was significantly associated with fewer revisits for any reason or related to COVID-19 at any time.;CONCLUSION: Fewer than half the total number of emergency department revisits after initial care for COVID-19 were related to the novel coronavirus infection.

This process has been compared with atherosclerosis because of shared pathology and risk factors. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of inflammation triggered by cholesterol infiltration and cholesterol crystals formation causing mechanical and biochemical injury in heart valves. METHODS Human and atherosclerotic rabbit heart valves were evaluated. New Zealand White male rabbits were fed an enriched cholesterol diet alone or with simvastatin and ezetimibe simultaneous or after 6 months of initiating cholesterol diet. Inflammation was measured using C-reactive protein (CRP) and RAM 11 of tissue macrophage content. Cholesterol crystal presence and content in valves was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS Cholesterol diet alone induced cholesterol infiltration of valves with associated increased inflammation. Tissue cholesterol, CRP levels and RAM 11 were significantly lower in simvastatin and ezetimibe rabbit groups compared with cholesterol diet alone. However, the treatment was effective only when initiated with a cholesterol diet but not after lipid infiltration in valves. Aortic valve cholesterol content was significantly greater than all other cardiac valves. Extensive amounts of cholesterol crystals were noted in rabbit valves on cholesterol diet and in diseased human valves. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of valve infiltration with cholesterol and reduced inflammation by simvastatin and ezetimibe was effective only when given during the initiation of high cholesterol diet but was not effective when given following infiltration of cholesterol into the valve matrix.","output":"Cholesterol induced heart valve inflammation and injury: efficacy of cholesterol lowering treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most devastating pandemic of this era coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We assessed the effects of the influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.27.01 years, 36.6% were women, 65.1% had hypertension, 31.1% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4% were smokers. At a median follow-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 [P<0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94 [P<0.001]) compared with control. The use of the influenza vaccine was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49-1.09 [P=0.12]) compared with control. Conclusions Data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies support the use of the influenza vaccine in adults with cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events, as currently supported by clinical guidelines.

The activity of natural killer cells and the serum concentrations of interleuin-2, interleukin-6 and TNF- were measured in 12 cases of transmediastinal dissection and 10 cases of transthioracic en bloc esophageal resection and compared to values of a control group of thoracic and abdominal surgical patients with non-malignant maladies. Natural killer cells assume a central role in the non-specific immunological response in tumor patients. Their main function is the destruction of tumor cells via cytotoxic activities amplified by the release of interleukin-2 and TNF-. Natural killer cell activity was measured prior to surgery and on postoperative days 4 and 10 using a standardized europium chloride release assay, utilizing K 562 target cells. Lymphokines interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and THF- were also measured on postoperative days 1 and 7 using standardized ELISA assays. The activity of natural killer cells in our patient group sank significantly (P<0.05) on postoperative day 4 and likewise in the control group and both study groups, activity sank to the original values. In the control groups, natural killer cell activity averaged 45% of preoperative values, in comparison with an average of 63% following transmediastinal esophageal carcinoma resection (one cavity procedure), and transthoracic en bloc resection patients only reached 61% of preoperative values, transmediastinal dissection patients assumed 75%, and 77% was achieved by control group members. Transthoracic en bloc resection of the esophagus led to a more extreme reduction in cytotoxic cellular activity owing to the greater surgical trauma. Suppression of the immunological tumor resistance, especially in the vulnerable perisurgical pahse, can have an indirect negative effect on the manifestation risk of hematogenic metastases owing to intraoperative tumor cell dissemination resulting from tumor manipulation and may thus be prognostically relevant.","output":"Einflu? des operationstraumas auf die NK-zell-aktivit?t beim ?sophaguskarizinom nach transmediastinaler dissektion vs. transthorakaler en-bloc-resektion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinology is a combinatorial science which studies the diversity of pathogens and the human immune system, and formulations that can modulate immune responses and prevent or cure disease.

The study revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However, after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S. states and for all the studied statistics. The U.S. states showed a synchronized trend, regardless of the timeline of their statewide COVID-19 case spreads or government orders.","output":"Observed mobility behavior data reveal social distancing inertia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted domestic violence survivors isolation, and has triggered innovative efforts to reach out to people who are trapped in their homes, more endangered by a partner than by the virus. But a related C and extremely damaging - consequence of this challenging time has received far less attention: survivors intensified experience with loneliness. Although loneliness can be catalyzed by isolation, it is a distinct psychological phenomenon that is interior and subjective in nature. Loneliness is not only acutely painful in its own right, but it also inflicts a range of long-lasting health-related harms, and heightens survivors vulnerability to IPV, creating a vicious cycle that may continue long after strict stay-at-home policies end. This may be particularly true for marginalized survivors, for whom larger structural inequalities and institutional failures heighten and compound the negative impact of loneliness. This brief report describes what we know about the nature and costs of survivor loneliness;and argues that that the COVID-19 pandemic provides a useful impetus to both review the ways in which current DV interventions may help alleviate loneliness (as distinct from isolation), and how we might intentionally adopt deeper and more expansive measures, now and particularly after a return to normal.","output":"COVID-19 and the Loneliness Pandemic: Implications for Intimate Partner Violence Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High social value is fundamental to justifying these studies.","output":"Ethics of controlled human infection to study COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helminths, including nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, are complex parasitic organisms that infect at least one billion people globally living in extreme poverty. Helminthic infections are associated with severe morbidity particularly in young children who often harbor the highest burden of disease. While each helminth species completes a distinct life cycle within the host, several helminths incite significant lung disease. This impact on the lungs occurs either directly from larval migration and host immune activation or indirectly from a systemic inflammatory immune response. The impact of helminths on the pulmonary immune response involves a sophisticated orchestration and activation of the host innate and adaptive immune cells. The consequences of activating pulmonary host immune responses are variable with several helminthic infections leading to severe, pulmonary compromise while others providing immune tolerance and protection against the development of pulmonary diseases. Further delineation of the convoluted interface between helminth infection and the pulmonary host immune responses is critical to the development of novel therapeutics that are critically needed to prevent the significant global morbidity caused by these parasites.","output":"Host Immunity and Inflammation to Pulmonary Helminth Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deaths due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic vary (3-1681 deaths/million and mortality rates 0.71-14.54%) and are far greater in some countries compared to others. This observation led us to perform epidemiological analysis, using data in the public domain, to study the correlation of COVID-19 with the prevalence and vaccination strategies for two respiratory pathogens: flu and tuberculosis (TB). Countries showing more than 1000 COVID-19 deaths were selected at three time points during the ongoing pandemic: 17 May, 1 October and 31 December 2020. The major findings of this study that are broadly consistent at all three time points are: First, countries with high flu deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Second, TB incidences and deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Countries displaying high TB and flu deaths (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Indonesia, India) display lower COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with low TB and flu deaths (Italy, Spain, USA, France). Third, countries with greater flu vaccination display lower flu incidences but higher COVID-19 deaths/million and mortality rates. On the other hand, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination negatively correlates with Covid-19 deaths/million. Fourth, countries with only BCG, but no flu, vaccination show delayed and lower number of COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with flu, but no BCG, vaccination. Fifth, countries with high BCG vaccination coverage as well as high TB deaths display the lowest COVID-19 deaths/million.

To manage the risk of the pandemic and to mitigate its further spread, governments of many countries applied various pandemic risk mitigation measures. Media campaigns played a particularly large role during the pandemic, too. In addition, social media grew in importance because of the spread of technologies and as a result of the increased attention to information about COVID-19. Media information strongly influenced both the public perception of COVID-19 risk and decision-making processes and choices, which people made regarding risk reduction measures during the pandemic. Moreover, media information has had a major impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of various countries' risk management actions. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate the influence of the Russian media on the population's perception of risk, and to address the question about which linguistic and psychological methods they used to shape different media discourses about the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we analyzed media discourses as a part of the case study of COVID-19 risk management in the Russian Federation. The theoretical basis of the study includes mass communication theories. The methodological basis consists of linguo-cognitive analysis of empirical materials for specific political-philosophical, linguistic-publicistic, and sociopsychological functioning.","output":"Analyzing Russian Media Policy on Promoting Vaccination and Other COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Haemophilus parasuis is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of swine and is capable of causing a systemic infection, resulting in high morbidity and mortality.

Examination of OMV structures has led to identification of virulence factors in a number of bacteria and they have been successfully used as subunit vaccines. We have isolated OMV from both virulent and avirulent strains of H. parasuis, have examined their protein content and assessed their ability to induce an immune response in the host.

We reported 2 cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 receiving tracheal intubation twice during the hospitalization. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two elderly patients with onset of fever and upper respiratory tract infection were confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 19, 1 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease previously. With active antiviral and noninvasive respiratory supportive therapy, there was no improvement, thus mechanical ventilation (MV) was adopted. Combining with symptomatic and supportive treatment, their oxygenation recovered and then extubation was carried out. However, 96ahours later, they underwent endotracheal intubation again due to their Coronavirus Disease 19 progression. DIAGNOSIS: Critically ill Coronavirus Disease 19 requiring tracheal intubation owing to respiratory failure with lung.javascript. INTERVENTIONS: Initial Strategy for respiratory failure included endotracheal intubation, MV, antiviral treatment and cortisol in both cases. When extubation criteria were satisfied, early discontinuation of MV was conducted, then rehabilitation exercise and nutritional support followed. However, 96ahours later, the disease progressed leading to respiratory failure again, thus reintubation was performed. Later, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed owing to aggravation of respiratory failure, assisted by prone position treatment and sputum drainage, then status became stable and stepped into recovery stage. OUTCOMES: Both patients underwent reintubation, and their MV time and Intensive care unit residence time were prolonged. Through prone position treatment, sputum drainage and awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation strategy, patient has been transferred to rehabilitation unit in Case 1, and patient in Case 2 has been in recovery stage as well with stable pulmonary status and was expected to receive evaluation in recent future. LESSONS: Course of Coronavirus Disease 19 is relatively longer, and failure rate of simple early extubation seemes higher.

Emergency nurses constitute the first line of treatment in healthcare facilities when catastrophic events bring disaster victims in need of medical attention. Therefore, these nurses must be well educated and trained efficiently to be able to deal with disastrous situations properly. This study aimed to distinguish the most important elements of education and training for preparing emergency nurses to face disasters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), specifically, the city of Taif. METHODS: This study employed a tool to measure nurses most important training and education needs that was created by the authors based on a literature review and was approved by an expert panel in disaster nursing. Questionnaires were distributed to emergency nurses in four hospitals run by the Ministry of Health in Taif city. Survey responses were received from 210 participants, and the data were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA). A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups according to their experiences. RESULTS: The following three factors were extracted from the data after redundant items were loaded and excluded: incident management systems (IMSs), disaster triage, and disaster drills. Nurses with less than three years of experience have a significant need to learn about these elements in order to be able to cope with disasters. CONCLUSION: Understanding different types of disasters and how to deal with these catastrophic events is crucial. Significant differences existed between ED nurses in their understanding of the basic elements of disaster management based on their level of experience in an ED. Therefore, disaster education must be included in nursing curricula, and more training courses, mock drills, and simulations must be conducted in hospitals for nurses, especially nurses with less experience, so they can learn to manage their responsibilities during disasters.","output":"Identify the Disaster Nursing Training and Education Needs for Nurses in Taif City, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has impacted the global landscape well beyond initial estimates, impacting on both societal and economic fronts Immediate responses by corporations and governments were geared toward building knowledge so that accurate and efficient programs could be devised toward curbing the impacts of the pandemic on society However, one aspect to this was noted as to the limited availability of data sharing across platforms, systems, and jurisdictions, leading to limited datasets, hence, rendering inaccurate predictions that can be used to contain and limit the virus outbreak In view of required immediate actions, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science concept have emerged, where people voluntarily share location and health status data to circumvent data sharing restrictions imposed upon corporations and governments This is leading to more accurate predictions and supporting an emergence of alternative tools This chapter explores this dimension and outlines how people, previously aggressively resisting data sharing, do so willingly in times of emergencies","output":"Chapter 5 - The Emergence of Voluntary Citizen Networks to Circumvent Urban Health Data Sharing Restrictions During Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination may be critical to curtailing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, but herd immunity can only be realized with high vaccination coverage. There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social norms - estimates of peers' behavior and attitudes - are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. METHOD: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers' vaccination behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants' own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing norms-based intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of forthcoming COVID vaccines among young adults.","output":"Social norms and vaccine uptake: College students' COVID vaccination intentions, attitudes, and estimated peer norms and comparisons with influenza vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First, theories of globalisation and their implications for the analysis of health issues are discussed.

People differ by age and skill, and choose occupations and whether to commute to work or work from home, to maximize their income and minimize their fear of infection. Occupations differ by wage, infection risk, and the productivity loss when working from home. By setting the model parameters to replicate the progression of COVID-19 in South Korea and the United Kingdom, we obtain three key results. First, government-imposed lock-downs may not present a clear trade-off between GDP and public health, as commonly believed, even though its immediate effect is to reduce GDP and infections by forcing people to work from home. A premature lifting of the lock-down raises GDP temporarily, but infections rise over the next months to a level at which many people choose to work from home, where they are less productive, driven by the fear of infection. A longer lock-down eventually mitigates the GDP loss as well as flattens the infection curve. Second, if the UK had adopted South Korean policies, its GDP loss and infections would have been substantially smaller both in the short and the long run. This is not because Korea implemented policies sooner, but because aggressive testing and tracking more effectively reduce infections and disrupt the economy less than a blanket lock-down. Finally, low-skill workers and self-employed lose the most from the epidemic and also from the government policies. However, the policy of issuing visas to those who have antibodies will disproportionately benefit the low-skilled, by relieving them of the fear of infection and also by allowing them to get back to work.","output":"Inequality of Fear and Self-Quarantine: Is There a Trade-off between GDP and Public Health?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data.

DESIGN: We checked the serum calcium level of the patients based on days after symptom onset as well as the severity of COVID-19. We also checkeed multi-organ injuries and immune cytokines level in their blood. RESULTS: Both mild/moderate and severe critical cases we observed showed low calcium level in the early stage of viral infection, while the severe/critical cases showed significant lower calcium level than mild/moderate cases in the early stage. We also found that low calcium level related to severe/critical multi-organ injuries especially in the mild/moderate population.

Baseline impedance was measured over 15 seconds during the landmark period of HRIM and over three 10 minute intervals during the overnight period of MII-pH. KEY RESULTS Among 29 GERD patients and 26 controls, GERD patients had a mean esophageal acid exposure time of 22.7% compared to 1.2% in controls (P<.0001). Mean baseline impedance during HRIM was lower in GERD (1061 ) than controls (2814 ) (P<.0001). Baseline mucosal impedance measured during HRIM and MII-pH correlated (r=0.59, P<.0001). High-resolution esophageal manometry baseline impedance had high diagnostic accuracy for GERD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A HRIM baseline impedance threshold of 1582  had a sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 88.5% for GERD, with a positive predictive value of 89.3% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Baseline impedance measured during HRIM can reliably discriminate GERD patients with at least moderate esophageal acid exposure from controls. This diagnostic tool may represent an accurate, cost-effective, and less invasive test for GERD.","output":"Baseline impedance measured during high-resolution esophageal impedance manometry reliably discriminates GERD patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to threaten public health and safety, every state has strategically reopened the business in the United States. It is urgent to evaluate the effect of reopening policies on the COVID-19 pandemic to help with the decision-making on the control measures and medical resource allocations. In this study, a novel SEIR model was developed to evaluate the effect of reopening policies based on the real-world reported COVID-19 data in Texas. The earlier reported data before the reopening were used to develop the SEIR model; data after the reopening were used for evaluation. The simulation results show that if continuing the \\"stay-at-home order\\" without reopening the business, the COVID-19 pandemic could end in December 2020 in Texas. On the other hand, the pandemic could be controlled similarly as the case of no-reopening only if the contact rate was low and additional high magnitude of control measures could be implemented. If the control measures are only slightly enhanced after reopening, it could flatten the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic with reduced numbers of infections and deaths, but it might make the epidemic last longer. Based on the reported data up to July 2020 in Texas, the real-world epidemic pattern is between the cases of the low and high magnitude of control measures with a medium risk of contact rate after reopening. In this case, the pandemic might last until summer 2021 to February 2022 with a total of 4-10 million infected cases and 20,080-58,604 deaths.","output":"Assessing effects of reopening policies on COVID-19 pandemic in Texas with a data-driven transmission model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thoracic diseases are the most common radiological disorders worldwide especially in India.

RESULTS: Included were 866 patients. Total leukocytes, neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, AST, ALT and LDH increase with worsening parenchymal involvement; an increase in platelets was appreciable with the highest burden of lung involvement. A decrease in lymphocyte counts paralleled worsening parenchymal extension, along with reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure and saturation. After correcting for parenchymal extension, ground-glass opacities were associated with reduced platelets and increased procalcitonin, consolidation with increased CRP and reduced oxygen saturation.

The descriptions made by all of these scholars not only contribute to language with linguistic innovations but also cause the emergence of human attitudes and behaviours. At the same time, the issues raised through the language used during the challenging time of such crises shape and reveal several human schemas of language, discourse, society, and culture. Several studies on past situations of diseases and calamities have provided critical analyses of these schemas of difficult times in human history. Discourses through various linguistic practices in this regard play a crucial role in shaping and demonstrating the schemas of the crisis hit societies. Media discourse, specifically, has hidden powers to exercise, identify and report various socio-cultural issues. The current study focuses on finding the themes of socio-cultural attitudes and behaviours that emerged from newspaper editorials published in Pakistani newspapers in February, March and April, 2020. To achieve this goal, the corpus-driven analysis of 198 newspaper editorials having 215,842 words was conducted. The study revealed various themes that prevailed in this pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The themes included the metaphoric use of the language such as battle, corps and frontline;racism while naming the virus as China virus or Hazara virus;conspiracy theories assumed to be associated with COVID-19 spread i.e. suspected involvement of Bill Gates and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US and World Health Organization (WHO);negligence on the part of people;and criticism on government for health facilities and implications of globalization. It is concluded, based on these findings, that media representation of pre-vaccination phase of COVID-19 in Pakistan is loaded with unhealthy discourse which could have been avoided in order to shape positive attitudes and behaviours of the masses. ? 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

We performed a study to compare the safety, efficacy and outcomes of RFA compared to those of open surgery and laser ablation for the treatment of varicose veins. We also carried out a cost analysis of RFA compared to open surgery to assess whether RFA could help free up operating room time by being performed in an outpatient context. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review (publication date May 2010-September 2013 for articles in English, January 1991-September 2013 for those in French). We used several checklists to measure the quality of the studies. We also collected data on costing. RESULTS The literature search identified 924 publications, of which 38 were retained for analysis: 15 literature reviews, 1 good-practice guideline and 22 new primary studies. The overall level of evidence was low to moderate owing to the limited sample sizes, lack of information on patient characteristics and lack of standardization of the outcome measures. However, the results obtained are consistent from study to study. In the short and medium term, RFA is considered as effective as open surgery or laser treatment (moderate level of evidence) and presents fewer major and minor complications than open surgery (low level of evidence). Radiofrequency ablation can be performed on an outpatient basis. We calculated that RFA would be about $110-$220 more expensive per patient than open surgery.

We aimed to further describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of discharged COVID-19 cases and evaluate the public health interventions. METHODS: We collected epidemiological and clinical data of all discharged COVID-19 cases as of 17 February 2020 in Shanghai. The key epidemiological distributions were estimated and outcomes were also compared between patients whose illness were before 24 January and those whose illness were after 24 January. RESULTS: Of 161 discharged COVID-19 cases, the median age was 45 years, and 80 (49.7%) cases were male. All of the cases were categorized as clinical moderate type. The most common initial symptoms were fever (85.7%), cough (41.0%), fatigue (19.3%), muscle ache (17.4%), sputum production (14.9%), and there were six asymptomatic cases. 39 (24.2%) cases got infected in Shanghai, and three of them were second-generation cases of Shanghai native cases. The estimated median of the time from onset to first medical visit, admission, disease confirmation, and discharge for 161 cases was 1.0 day (95% CI, 0.6-1.2), 2.0 days (95% CI, 1.5-2.6), 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.6-5.7), 18.1 days (95% CI, 17.4-18.8), respectively. The estimated median of the time from admission to discharge was 14.0 days (95% CI, 13.3-14.6). The time from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response.

Public health foresight studies (PHFS) are tools to support this. The current health crisis makes clear that PHFS are necessary more than ever to target possible future impacts resulting from SARS-COV-2 induced changes in e.g. regular health care services, lifestyle and socio-economic developments. To support European countries in doing their own foresight studies, PHIRI aims to strengthen foresight capacity. Methods PHIRI follows a 4-step approach: 1. Making an inventory of current PHFS capacities and capacity needs across European countries using desk research and an online survey;2. Providing PHFS capacity building via a training course and workshops;3. Supporting the development of public health scenarios for the short term (0-5 years) and longer-term (5-20 years);4. Supporting the identification of promising policy strategies, using policy dialogues. Results The online survey was completed by participants of 21 countries and shed light on existing national PHFS and needs for capacity building. It also provided a basis for the development of a professional network on PHFS within the project. Literature research revealed a range of studies using stakeholder involvement and scenario analysis to explore alternative futures.

In this paper, in order to understand the fuel performance of U3Si5, the primary point defects, secondary point defects, and the dissolution of He gas were studied by first-principles methods. Compared with U atoms and another type of Si2 atoms, Si1 atoms far from intrinsic Si vacancies are more likely to form point defects, implying that Si vacancies are prone to form separate single vacancies rather than vacancy clusters in the initial stage. From the calculated anti-site defect energies, it can be predicted that non-stoichiometric U-rich phase of U3Si5 are more likely to be formed than Si-rich phase, which are consistent with the chemical analysis of experimentally sintered Si-lean U3Si5 sample. It can be found that a single He atom favors residence in the interstitial site in the U layer directly above/below the intrinsic vacancy. It can also be seen that Vac-U, Vac-Si1, and Vac-Si2 vacancies can energetically accommodate up to 4, 0, and 3 He atoms, respectively. The formation of secondary vacancy defects is strongly dependent on the helium concentration. The current results show that the He-filled vacancy can promote the formation of adjacent secondary vacancy, leading to the formation of gas bubbles.

The impact of ablation algorithm (stepwise or direct heating, single or overlapping ablations, and ablation margin) and tumor-dependent (type, size, location, and blood vessel proximity) parameters on LR was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS A total of 179 patients with 602 liver tumors underwent 200 MWA procedures. Colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) was the most frequent tumor type followed by neuroendocrine liver metastasis (NELM), other metastatic tumors, and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

The ESSENCE concept began in an internally funded project at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, advanced with funding from the State of Maryland, and broadened in 1999 as a collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. Versions of the system have been further developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in multiple military and civilian programs for the timely detection and tracking of health threats. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the components and development of a biosurveillance system increasingly coordinating all-hazards health surveillance and infectious disease monitoring among large and small health departments, to list the key features and lessons learned in the growth of this system, and to describe the range of initiatives and accomplishments of local epidemiologists using it. METHODS: The features of ESSENCE include spatial and temporal statistical alerting, custom querying, user-defined alert notifications, geographical mapping, remote data capture, and event communications. To expedite visualization, configurable and interactive modes of data stratification and filtering, graphical and tabular customization, user preference management, and sharing features allow users to query data and view geographic representations, time series and data details pages, and reports. These features allow ESSENCE users to gather and organize the resulting wealth of information into a coherent view of population health status and communicate findings among users. RESULTS: The resulting broad utility, applicability, and adaptability of this system led to the adoption of ESSENCE by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, numerous state and local health departments, and the Department of Defense, both nationally and globally. The open-source version of Suite for Automated Global Electronic bioSurveillance is available for global, resource-limited settings.

Network analysis was performed using the R qgraph package. RESULTS: In total, 445 (82.6%) participants scored high on their willingness to vaccinate. Attitude towards vaccines, the influence of people around an individual and health status were directly significantly related to vaccination willingness. The betweenness of age was the highest and, the emotional states had the strongest centrality. LIMITATIONS: Network analysis is not sufficient to determine the causal relationships of the links between nodes. In addition, there are other latent essential elements that were not evaluated. Finally, the sample size was relatively small. CONCLUSION: Network analysis showed that attitude toward vaccines and emotional states are the most critical factors affecting vaccination willingness, which indicates that we should pay attention to the impact of the dissemination of Internet information on vaccination willingness and public emotional states during a pandemic which is very important for promoting vaccination programs.","output":"The willingness of Chinese adults to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and its associated factors at the early stage of the vaccination programme: a network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tujuan dari penelitian ini untuk mengetahui bagaimana cara subjek melakukan copping stress yang telah menangani pasien COVID-19.

In reaction, science, technology and innovation communities across the globe have organised themselves to contribute to national responses to COVID-19 disease. A significant contribution has been from the establishment of wastewater-based epidemiological (WBE) surveillance interventions and programmes for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in at least 55 countries. Here, we examine and share experiences and lessons learnt in establishing such surveillance programmes. We use case studies to highlight testing methods and logistics considerations associated in scaling the implementing of such programmes in South Africa, the Netherlands, Turkey and England. The four countries were selected to represent different regions of the world and the perspective based on the considerable progress made in establishing and implementing their national WBE programmes. The selected countries also represent different climatic zones, economies, and development stages, which influence the implementation of national programmes of this nature and magnitude. In addition, the four countries programmes offer good experiences and lessons learnt since they are systematic, and cover extensive areas, disseminate knowledge locally and internationally and partnered with authorities (government). The programmes also strengthened working relations and partnerships between and among local and global organisations.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey among public hospitals of Punjab was carried out that provide emergency and elective surgical care. We measured capacity in terms of infrastructure; surgical, anesthetic, and obstetric (SAO) workforce; surgical interventions; information management; equipment; and medication which was accomplished between October 2020 and February 2021. Results: Out of 106 public hospitals in Punjab, almost 40% had only one anesthesia provider. Only 50% of the hospitals reported round the clock availability of anesthesia providers for surgical cases. While caesarean sections were carried out in more than 90% of health facilities, general surgery, pediatric surgery, and open fracture surgery were conducted only in 50% of the hospitals. Although local and general anesthetic agents were available in the majority of hospitals, essential medicines for safe anesthesia were not available in all hospitals. Conclusion: This first comprehensive assessment of anesthesia health system capacity exposed a crucial deficiency of critical supplies and workforce for providing safe anesthesia and, hence, safe surgery.

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Cressa cretica is reported to show antitubercular, antibacterial and expectorant property. In this research, we aim to prospect the COVID-19 main protease crystal structure (M(pro); PDB ID: 6LU7) and the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica in order to understand the structural basis of their interactions. We examined the binding potential of active constituents of Cressa cretica plant to immensely conserved protein M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of proteinCligand complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results suggest the effectiveness of 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Quercetin against standard drug Remdesivir. The active chemical constituents exhibited good docking scores, and interacts with binding site residues of M(pro) by forming hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid showed the best affinity towards M(pro) receptor which is one of the target enzymes required by SARS CoV-2 virus for replication suggesting it to be a novel research molecule. The potential of the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has best been highlighted through this study. Therefore, these chemical entities can be further scrutinized and provides direction for further consideration for in-vivo and in-vitro validations for the treatment of covid-19.","output":"Prospecting for Cressa cretica to treat COVID-19 via in silico molecular docking models of the SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Designing novel antiviral personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial for preventing viral infections such as COVID-19 in humans.

and practitioners to discuss the structural problems facing visual effects within the film and television industry today This discussion is organized around four sub-Topics: 1) labor solutions and what unionization would mean, 2) perceptions of VFX artists and their contributions within the industry by filmmakers and artists themselves, as well as the audience, 3) issues of inclusivity along gender and racial lines, and their effects on work/life balances, and 4) VFX as equal creative partners rather than isolated, temporary, highly-skilled specialists This panel is a continuation of work begun by the faculty and practitioner organizers, Heath Hanlin (Syracuse University, VPA) and Shaina Holmes (Syracuse University, Newhouse) on studying structural challenges and obstacles to entry for students hoping to enter the VFX industry, in particular women, and artists of color An earlier iteration of this discussion was held at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival The hope is that the technical focus and high attendance by industry practitioners at Siggraph, adds practitioner perspectives and educator feedback to the sub-Topics listed above Simply put, today's film and television industry rely heavily on visual effects, both to advance the story or as a means to hide imperfections to keep the audience engaged without technical distractions Traditional conceptions of VFX artistry as a production step that comes after primary cinematography is simply outdated Unfortunately, the economic and work-flow structure of the industry accepts this new reality while at the same time attempting to compensate, credit, and organize VFX artists within the outdated framework Often this aspect of the conversation is moored in debates surrounding the potentiality of AI to either positively impact the industry (no more underpaid routinized tasks for artists) or negatively (crafts persons and artists can be replaced by algorithms) Rather, a more fruitful discussion around this point should be centered on labor issues and globalization (sub-Topic #1) of VFX within the industry to reflect the VFX Artist's increased importance in most contemporary productions This new economic bargaining power cannot be established if we first don't engage with, educate, and change the discourse surrounding how other creatives in the industry view VFX artists (sub-Topic #2) and their critical roles This panel discusses the stereotype of today's VFX workers as \\"easily trainable, easily replaceable, ?button-pushers', who can be substituted with intuitive AI\\"and how we can shift the narrative artisans and craft persons working on the level of a writer, director, or editor, using their talents to equally construct the narrative vision of the piece The film and television industry relies so heavily on VFX artists for their visions, that similar to the video game industry, long hours are required from those artists who toil away behind a monitor and keyboard At the same time, similar to the film and television industry as a whole, it is overly represented by majority white male workers who also disproportionately are not responsible for childcare and its accompanying social and emotional labor As such, VFX professionals, who are women, find themselves working within an unregulated part of the industry working over 100 hours per week on a project to project basis, not knowing what city, let alone country, their next job will be in, and if they will have time to dedicate to supporting, or even starting, a family (see sub-Topic #3) This panel discussion hopes to expand these voices and their perception on solutions to inclusivity within the industry Issues of equality are revealed in a broader sense when we realize VFX artists need to be recognized more as equal creative partners (see sub-Topic #2) due to their increased reliance upon and importance in the contemporary digital workflow of content creation and visual storytelling More than merely surveying other creators' perceptions of VFX artists' contributions, there eeds to be new contractual precedents and workflow procedures established in order to accomplish structural changes For example, VFX artists need to be at the beginning of production choices, not merely as pre-visualization workers, but as co-creators and organized division heads who can ready their departments for the production troubleshooting invariably ahead VFX need not be an afterthought-not secondary \\"fixers\\"who through a combination of creativity and technical know-how, solve problems quickly with little to no additional compensation Rather, they need to be co-leaders beginning right from pre-production until post as co-creatives This discussion amongst the panelists is expected to explore the topics above, but also expand and evolve into new conversations and connections to the artist, technology, industry, globalization, COVID-19 impact, and education spaces Towards the end of the dialogue, we

trees and grows new trees when concept drifts are detected. This is particularly wasteful when recurrent patterns exist. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called PEARL, which uses both an exact technique and a probabilistic graphical model with Lossy Counting, to replace drifted trees with relevant trees built from the past. The exact technique utilizes pattern matching to find the set of drifted trees, that co-occurred in predictions in the past. Meanwhile, a probabilistic graphical model is being built to capture the tree replacements among recurrent concept drifts. Once the graphical model becomes stable, it replaces the exact technique and finds relevant trees in a probabilistic fashion. Further, Lossy Counting is applied to the graphical model which brings an added theoretical guarantee for both error rate and space complexity. We empirically show our technique outperforms baselines in terms of cumulative accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","output":"PEARL: Probabilistic Exact Adaptive Random Forest with Lossy Counting for Data Streams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide problem for the human population.

Although most such work concentrates on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), here TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), neuropilin-1 and furin are also considered. Polymorphisms, especially ones which are known to alter viral/host interactions are also discussed. Analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein sequences across species suggests this approach may be of some utility in predicting susceptibility; however, this analysis fails to highlight some susceptible animals such as mink. However, combined with observational data which emerges over time about which animals actually become infected, this may, in the future, be a useful tool to assist the management of risks associated with human/animal contact and support conservation and animal welfare measures.","output":"Interacting Proteins, Polymorphisms and the Susceptibility of Animals to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Raj Nirwan Bati (RNB) worlds first ALLOVEDIC medicine, that has been formulated at UP University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, Etawah and scientifically proven to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19, can prove to be a milestone in containing this pandemic in India as well as rest of the world. This study was conducted to see the effects of Raj Nirvan Bati (RNB) on haematobiochemical parameters and histopathological changes in the lungs, liver and kidneys and also to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of RNB in wistar rats. In this study a total of 24 adult albino Wistar rats (approx.200-250 gms.) of either sex were used to study the effects of RNB on haematobiochemical parameters and histology of organs. Rats were procured from the Animal Husbandry department of UP University of Medical Sciences (UPUMS), Saifai, Etawah. The rats were weighed, marked and divided into 3 groups each consisting of 8 animals. In normal control group (n=8), no drug was administered and in rest of the groups (A & B), Raj Nirwan Bati @ 26 mg/kg B.wt./day and 260 mg/kg B.wt./day respectively was administered orally for a period of 14 days. The blood samples were collected from jugular vein at zero day (before drug administration) and after 14th day of drug administration in both groups (A and B) after giving light anaesthesia with Ketamine injection IM. The organ samples (Lungs, Liver, Kidneys and Spleen) were collected after euthanizing the rats by administration of Ketamine anaesthesia overdose IP after 14th day of drug administration. The individual organ index (spleen index) was calculated. After analyzing the results, it was concluded that RNB is having immunomodulatory effect which is indicated by increased percentage of monocytes in both groups A & B after RNB intervention, indicating more number of macrophages and increased phagocytic activity. The results of coagulation tests indicate that the drug RNB might be helpful in restoration of coagulation factors and can be helpful in treating the COVID patients. The therapeutic dose of RNB (26 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 14 days showed no harmful effect on lungs, liver, kidney and spleen with similar histological picture just like control group, however after administration of ten times higher dose of RNB (260 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 14 days, kidney and spleen showed no significant changes while it promotes inflammation and oxidative stress in liver and lungs tissue. The findings of this experimental study of RNB on wistar rats may act as a baseline data for planning further clinical trials in human study subjects to evaluate the effects on various comorbidities.Funding Information: This study was done under intramural research project and its funding source was UP University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, Etawah, U.P., India.

Herein, advanced multi-lamellar microspheres (CPG-Ln-MSs) with cascade endotoxin adsorption and oxidative stress relief functions are constructed as an alternative adsorbent for hemoperfusion therapy towards sepsis. The CPG-Ln-MSs achieve effective endotoxin absorption (nearly 455.3 EU/g) and show excellent broad-spectrum radical scavenging activity for treating oxidative stress triggered by endotoxin accumulation. Specifically, the structural integrity of the multi-layered structure plays a vital role in promoting the efficiency of endotoxin removal and the subsequently scavenging of reactive oxygen species. Hemoperfusion simulation experiments demonstrate that the CPG-Ln-MSs could effectively remove endotoxin with a ratio of 92%, and the following oxidative stress state could be well alleviated, as confirmed by the reduced H2O2 and MDA levels in septic blood. Furthermore, endogenous antioxidants could be restored (recover SOD and CAT activity to 96.9 and 10.1 U/mL, respectively) and the red blood cells could be protected from oxidative damage.

MiR-26a was reported to be highly expressed in ADSCs under induction and Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2), as a key substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) could inhibit white adipocyte differentiation, which was mediated by miR-26a. However, the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5/FOXC2 during ADSCs differentiation remains unknown. We want to verify the regulated mechanism of miR-26a/CDK5/FOXC2 axis participating in the adipogenic differentiation of ADSCS. METHODS ADSCs were isolated and verified by flow cytometry. Oil Red O staining was performed to assess the capacity for adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The proliferation ability of ADSCs was verified by MTT assay. The expression of miR-26a, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  (PPAR), CDK5, and FOXC2 were tested by qRT-PCR and Western blot, and the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. RESULTS MiR-26a and PPAR were upregulated and CDK5 and FOXC2 were downregulated during adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Knockdown of miR-26a or overexpression of CDK5 could inhibit adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs induced by insulin. MiR-26a could directly target CDK5 and the effect of miR-26a inhibitor on adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs could be blocked by si-CDK5. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that miR-26a regulated insulin-induced adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs by regulating CDK5/FOXC2 pathway, which could provide the key to a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of obesity and type 2 diabetes.","output":"MiR-26a regulated adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs induced by insulin through CDK5/FOXC2 pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), now a global pandemic, is a new, highly contagious, and preventable disease that has caused many deaths across the world.

We focus upon the less-usual case of an eighteen-year-old female to illustrate the type of patient where HFNO may be used when perhaps earlier intubation once was. It is important to consider the wider implications of intubation. We have used HFNO as a bridge to intubation or as definitive management. As we await clinical trial evidence, HFNO with self-prone positioning has a role in COVID-19 for certain patients. Response parameters must be set and reviewed, oxygen infrastructure considered, and potential staff droplet exposure minimised.

Together with socio-economic factors, these variables affect the incidence and intensity of cholera outbreaks. The current pandemic of cholera began in the 1960s, and millions of cholera cases are reported each year globally. Hence, cholera remains a significant health challenge, notably where human vulnerability intersects with changes in hydrological and environmental processes. Cholera outbreaks may be epidemic or endemic, the mode of which is governed by trigger and transmission components that control the outbreak and spread of the disease, respectively. Traditional cholera risk assessment models, namely compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type models, have been used to determine the predictive spread of cholera through the fecalCoral route in human populations. However, these models often fail to capture modes of infection via indirect routes, such as pathogen movement in the environment and heterogeneities relevant to disease transmission. Conversely, other models that rely solely on variability of selected environmental factors (i.e., examine only triggers) have accomplished real-time outbreak prediction but fail to capture the transmission of cholera within impacted populations. Since the mode of cholera outbreaks can transition from epidemic to endemic, a comprehensive transmission model is needed to achieve timely and reliable prediction with respect to quantitative environmental risk. Here, we discuss progression of the trigger module associated with both epidemic and endemic cholera, in the context of the autochthonous aquatic nature of the causative agent of cholera, V. cholerae, as well as disease prediction.","output":"A Review of the Environmental Trigger and Transmission Components for Prediction of Cholera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed people's way of life and posed great challenges to plastic surgery. Most of plastic surgeries are considered elective surgeries and are recommended to be delayed. But breast reconstruction in plastic surgery is special. Doctors associations from different countries have different rules on whether breast reconstruction surgery should be delayed. For the controversial topic of immediate breast reconstruction in the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted this study. METHODS: We searched English databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. The publication time of papers was set to be from the establishment of the databases to February 2021. All studies on immediate breast reconstruction in the COVID-19 pandemic were included in our study. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included in this study. Four studies recommended the use of breast implants or tissue expansion for breast reconstruction surgery and had good results in their clinical practice. In addition, 1 study planned to use autologous free tissue transfer for breast reconstruction, and 1 study planned to use microsurgical techniques for breast reconstruction. But these 2 technologies are still in the planning stage and have not yet been implemented. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, breast cancer surgery belongs to confine operation, and breast reconstruction surgery should be performed immediately after the completion of breast cancer surgery. We recommend the use of breast implants for breast reconstruction surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. Due to the limitations of the study, our proposed protocol for breast reconstruction surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic needs to be further validated in clinical studies.","output":"Breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic outbreaks are collective effects of ongoing globalization, urbanisation, population mobility, climate change, demographic change and evolution of newer strains of infectious agents that result in high morbidity, mortality and huge financial loss, such as COVID-19. Thus, the early prediction of the emergence of a disease can play a pivotal role to prevent a disease to become epidemic. The Edge AI based solution has been proposed for healthcare prediction using machine learning (ML). In this paper, our focus is to propose ML based advanced model for public healthcare to reduce and control epidemic outbreaks. Collective knowledge from interconnected disciplines, shared data repository, and diverse roles have been embedded into the proposed framework. An evaluation based on actual COVID-19 related data demonstrates that ML can be used for COVID risk prediction for public health data as well as to take preventive steps to combat epidemics in early-stage. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Post COVID-19 Intelligent Public Healthcare Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several recent studies suggest the possibility of a skin rash being a clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this case report is to bring attention to skin manifestations in the early stage of COVID-19 in order to support frontline physicians in their crucial activity of case identification. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an Italian 32-year-old female nurse who had several close contacts with multiple patients with COVID-19 as part of her professional workload. On March 13, 2020, the patient developed an itchy, erythematous papular rash (sparing only her face, scalp, and abdomen), which lasted for 10 days. The rash was accompanied by a feeling of general fatigue that gradually worsened over the following days and has continued for 5 months (until the end of July 2020). During the first week of remote assessment carried out by her general practitioner, the patient gradually developed a dry cough, intermittent fever, and diarrhoea and then had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Her skin manifestations disappeared completely 48 days after the onset of the disease, followed by the disappearance of the dry cough. CONCLUSIONS: In light of recent studies, this case report suggests that skin manifestations, when taken into account with other situational factors (such as profession and patient history) should be taken into proper consideration by frontline physicians as possibly being caused by SARS-CoV-2. Early identification of COVID-19 is a key part of the strategy of case detection and case isolation. To enhance this activity, further research is needed to establish frequency, symptoms, signs, and pathogenesis of skin manifestations in patients with COVID-19.","output":"An itchy erythematous papular skin rash as a possible early sign of COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To isolate and characterize an antifungal peptide from the seeds of Brassica parachinensis L.H.Bailey. Methods and Results: An antifungal peptide designated as brassiparin was isolated. It exhibited a molecular mass of 5716 Da. It potently inhibited mycelial growth in a number of fungal species including Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium maydis, Mycosphaerella arachidicola and Valsa mali. The antifungal activity of brassiparin toward M. arachidicola exhibited pronounced thermostability and pH stability. It inhibited proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells and the activity of HIV\\\\1 reverse transcriptase.

The human body has an elaborate system for managing and regulating the number of key trace metals circulating in the blood and stored cells. Inadequate zinc (Zn) and concurrent excess of copper (Cu) levels are associated with an increased level of oxidative stress, which may aggravate the microvascular lesions in diabetes mellitus. Several studies have revealed a significantly lower serum Zn concentration and increased Cu levels in DR when compared with diabetic patients without retinopathy and normal controls. These abnormalities are correlated with the duration of diabetes and higher levels of HbA1C. Multiple pathological mechanisms are proposed to explain these changes including hyperzincuria associated with polyuria, glycosuria, and proteinuria in diabetic patients, as well as impaired absorption of Zn at the gastrointestinal level. Increased levels of free Cu ions may be attributed to glycation and the release of Cu ions from the Cu-binding sites of proteins. Zn supplements and selective Cu chelators may be useful to alleviate oxidative stress and prevent DR progression.","output":"Serum levels of copper and zinc in diabetic retinopathy: Potential new therapeutic targets (Review)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upregulation of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1, also known as nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2 (NEAT2) or LINC00047) was found in various solid tumors, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). MALAT1 is a long noncoding (lnc)RNA that regulates many functional signaling pathways, including tumorigenesis. Herein, we observed the consistent upregulation of MALAT1 in MYST4-overexpressing cell lines, while MALAT1 was frequently found to be upregulated in various types of clinical carcinoma tissues, especially EOC. To further investigate the lncRNA MALAT1 in EOC progression, the transduced overexpression of MALAT1 in EOC cell lines and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was employed. We found that MALAT1 overexpression in EOC cell lines significantly increased drug resistance, cell migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the concomitant overexpression of MALAT1 in EOC cells and CAFs dramatically increased EOC cell invasion. Accordingly, a mechanistic investigation of MALAT1 overexpression in EOC cells showed that expressions of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and p-P38/p-NFB/Cox2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling were significantly increased, which stimulated inflammatory responses, whereas cell apoptosis was inhibited due to increased Bcl-2 levels and reduced Caspase3 levels. After MALAT1 was overexpressed in EOC cells, and the cyclin D1, p-PI3K, and p-Akt expressions increased, suggesting the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, while increased zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 (ZEB2), yes-associated protein (YAP), and vimentin expression with E-cadherin downregulation indicated the enhancement of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in terms of metastasis, thereby triggering EOC progression. Together, our findings demonstrate how MALAT1 overexpression facilitates an oncogenic function through inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, combined with increasing tumor cell inflammation, proliferation, and invasion in the EOC tumor microenvironment. MALAT1 is thus a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic for this malignancy.","output":"LncRNA MALAT1 Facilitates Ovarian Cancer Progression through Promoting Chemoresistance and Invasiveness in the Tumor Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is deepening the inequity and injustice among the vulnerable communities.

Due to its ability to absorb light in the blue spectrum, CUR is also used as a photosensitizer (PS) in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). However, CUR is hydrophobic, unstable in solutions, and has low bioavailability, which hinders its clinical use. To circumvent these drawbacks, drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been used. In this review, we summarize the DDSs used to carry CUR and their antimicrobial effect against viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including drug-resistant strains and emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The reviewed DDSs include colloidal (micelles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, cyclodextrins, chitosan, and other polymeric nanoparticles), metallic, and mesoporous particles, as well as graphene, quantum dots, and hybrid nanosystems such as films and hydrogels. Free (non-encapsulated) CUR and CUR loaded in DDSs have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action when used alone or as a PS in aPDT. They also show low cytotoxicity, in vivo biocompatibility, and improved wound healing.

The goal of this study was to determine the clinical and sociodemographic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a region of the Colombian Caribbean. METHODS: Between July and November 2020, a cross-sectional observational study was carried out in Crdoba, located in northeast Colombia in the Caribbean area. Eight municipalities with the largest populations were chosen and 2564 blood samples were taken. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used with the recombinant protein antigen N of SARS-CoV-2. The people included in the study were asked for sociodemographic and clinical data, which were analysed by statistical methods. RESULTS: A seroprevalence of 40.8% was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 in the Crdoba region. In the bivariate analysis, no differences were observed in seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 for gender or age range (p>0.05). Higher seropositivity was found in low socio-economic status and symptomatic patients (p<0.0001). A total of 30.7% of the asymptomatic patients were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, which could be linked to the spread of this infection. In the multivariate analysis, seroconversion was related to poverty and clinical manifestations such as anosmia and ageusia (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The high seropositivity in Crdoba is due to widespread SARS-CoV-2 in this population. The relationship between seropositivity and socio-economic status suggests a higher exposure risk to the virus caused by informal economic activities in low-income groups.

ViReMa initially attempts to align the 5 end of a read to the reference genome(s) with the Bowtie seed-based alignment. A new read segment is then made by either extracting any unaligned nucleotides at the 3 end of the read or by trimming the first nucleotide from the read. This continues iteratively until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed. With multiple reference genomes, it is possible to detect virus-to-host or inter-virus recombination.

To improve understanding of the causes and molecular regulatory mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon around calving, we examined the effect of an antigen challenge on gene expression modulation on cows prior to (BC) or after calving (AC) using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq). The transcriptome analysis of the cows blood identified a substantially higher number of loci affected in BC cows (2,235) in response to vaccination compared to AC cows (208) and revealed a divergent transcriptional profile specific for each group. In BC cows, a variety of loci involved in immune defense and cellular signaling processes were transcriptionally activated, whereas protein biosynthesis and posttranslational processes were tremendously impaired in response to vaccination. Furthermore, energy metabolism in the blood cells of BC cows was shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to the glycolytic system. In AC cows, the number and variety of regulated pathways involved in immunomodulation and maintenance of immnunocompetence are considerably lower after vaccination, and upregulation of arginine degradation was suggested as an immunosuppressive mechanism. Elevated transcript levels of erythrocyte-specific genes involved in gas exchange processes were a specific transcriptional signature in AC cows pointing to hematopoiesis activation. The divergent and substantially lower magnitude of transcriptional modulation in response to vaccination in AC cows provides evidence for a suppressed immune capacity of early lactating cows on the molecular level and demonstrates that an efficient immune response of cows is related to their physiological and metabolic status.","output":"Different Blood Cell-Derived Transcriptome Signatures in Cows Exposed to Vaccination Pre- or Postpartum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue of Neuron, Liu et al.

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from neonates and their environment has not been well studied. Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) is an emerging and sensitive technology that can aid infection control investigations. We sought to document surface contamination within the immediate environment of a preterm neonate with congenital COVID-19 using ddPCR. Methods & Materials On day 5 of life, a total of 23 environmental samples were collected in Eswabs (Amies media) based on proximity to the neonate, from the inside (7) and outside (16) of the neonate's incubator for ddPCR analysis. Samples were extracted, using an in-house method and each extract was run for reverse-transcription ddPCR measurement using the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR Kit. The 96-well RT-ddPCR ready plate was loaded into the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad, Pleasanton, CA). The fluorescence intensity of each droplet was measured, and droplets were determined to be positive or negative for gene targets (N1, N2). Results All samples collected from outside of the incubator were negative.These included: a stethoscope hanging outside of the incubator, nearby keyboard/mouse, wireless phone receiver, barcode scanner, blood culture bottles, pens/pencils, light switches, weigh scale, countertop/shelf, cart with drawers and incubator port release clips. Samples collected from inside the incubator were positive for SARS-CoV-2. These results reported in copies per microlitre (cp/L) extract included: the swaddle cloth (0.4 N2), sheets behind the neonate's head (11.4 N1, 16.9 N2), cardiorespiratory and saturation monitor leads and cables near the neonate's head (2.8 N1,4.5 N2), near the neonate's feet (2.1 N1, 3.7 N2), and nametags hanging on a panel (1.0 N1,1.2 N2). The highest levels were noted from the neonate's drool (25.2 N1, 35.2 N2). Conclusion The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by ddPCR in environmental samples inside the incubator confirming the ability of the neonate to spread the virus in close quarters.

Monitoring and control processes have been studied mostly with university students, which raises the question of how well do they work in groups of people from under-represented samples such as people with a low educational level. In this research, we tested the monitoring and control processes of three groups of participants from a non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) country (Colombia). Two groups of adults (aged 30C55 years) living in urban or rural areas and with a low educational level and a group of Colombian university students watched a bank robbery video and answered cued recall questions. To measure monitoring ability, participants rated their confidence that they had produced the correct answer, and to measure control they indicated whether they preferred to report or withhold the response were they in a trial. Results showed that the three groups had a functional ability to monitor their memories and control their behaviour, and that university students had better memory and metamemory than the two low education groups. The results support the concept that the basic metamemory processes of monitoring and control are functional in different groups of individuals, but the differences between groups highlight the need to test the generalizability of cognitive processes and phenomena across individuals.","output":"Monitoring and control processes in mock witnesses in under-represented non-WEIRD samples with high or low educational level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Surveillance for respiratory diseases in domestic National Army and National Guard training camps began after the United States entry into World War I, 17 months before the Spanish influenza pandemic appeared. Methods. Morbidity, mortality, and case-fatality data from 605 625 admissions and 18 258 deaths recorded for 7 diagnostic categories of respiratory diseases, including influenza and pneumonia, were examined over prepandemic and pandemic periods. Results. High pandemic influenza mortality was primarily due to increased incidence of, but not increased severity of, secondary bacterial pneumonias. Conclusions. Two prepandemic incidence peaks of probable influenza, in December 1917CJanuary 1918 and in MarchCApril 1918, differed markedly from the SeptemberCOctober 1918 pandemic onset peak in their clinical-epidemiologic features, and they may have been caused by seasonal or endemic viruses.

Objective To investigate the impact of factors including whether COVID-19 was clinically or laboratory-diagnosed, influenza vaccination, former or current tuberculosis, HIV, and other comorbidities on the hospitalized patients' outcomes. Design Observational nationwide cohort study. Patients All subjects, regardless of age, admitted to 4,251 Russian hospitals indexed in the Federal Register of COVID-19 patients between March 26, 2020, and June 3, 2020. All included patients for which complete clinical data were available were divided into two cohorts, with laboratory- and clinically verified COVID-19. Measurements We analyzed patients' age and sex, COVID-19 ICD-10 code, the length of the hospital stay, and whether they required ICU treatment or invasive mechanical ventilation. The other variables for analysis were: verified diagnosis of pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diseases of the endocrine system, cancer/malignancy, HIV, tuberculosis, and the data on influenza vaccination in the previous six months. Results This study enrolled 705,572 COVID-19 patients aged from 0 to 121 years, 50.4% females. 164,195 patients were excluded due to no confirmed COVID-19 (n=143,357) or insufficient and invalid clinical data (n=20,831). 541,377 participants were included in the study, 413,950 (76.5%) of them had laboratory-verified COVID-19, and 127,427 patients (23.5%) with the clinical verification. Influenza vaccination reduced the risk of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.76), mechanical ventilation requirement (OR 0.74), and the risk of death (HR 0.77). TB increased the mortality risk (HR 1.74) but reduced the likelihood of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.27). HIV comorbidity significantly increased the risks of transfer to the ICU (OR 2.46) and death (HR 1.60). Patients with the clinically verified COVID-19 had a shorter duration of hospital stay (HR 1.45) but a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08) and the likelihood of being ventilated (OR 1.36). According to the previously published data, age, male sex, endocrine disorders, and cardiovascular diseases increased the length of hospital stay, the risk of death, and transfer to the ICU. Limitations The study did not include a control group of subjects with no COVID-19. Because of that, some of the identified factors could not be specific for COVID-19. Conclusions Influenza vaccination could reduce the severity of the hospitalized patients' clinical outcomes, including mortality, regardless of age, social, and economic group. The other factors considered in the study did not reduce the assessed risks, but we observed several non-trivial associations that may optimize the management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Risk factors for outcomes of COVID-19 patients: an observational study of 795 572 patients in Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduced in the late 1980s for generalization purposes, pruning has now become a staple for compressing deep neural networks.

Research has shown that HIV self-testing may help increase such diagnoses, especially among the populations who are most affected by HIV. The objective of the study was to determine the uptake and diagnosis outcomes associated with free HIV self-testing. Methods We developed the first online mailout free HIV self-testing program in Canada and implemented it in Ottawa. This project ran through the website, www.GetaKit.ca. We intended to recruit 150-400 participants over a 6-12-month period, estimating that this number would yield between 0-1 positive test results (expected positivity rate of 0.08%). Results Between July 20, 2020 and April 1, 2021, 1,268 people accessed the GetaKit website and verified their eligibility. In total, 600 persons were eligible and 405 ordered an HIV kit. Of those who ordered a kit, 399 completed a baseline survey. Overall, 71% of these participants were members of HIV priority groups. For test results, 228 persons reported test results, with one being positive, for a positivity rate of 0.24% overall and 0.44% of reported results. These rates exceed that normally observed in Ottawa. Conclusion Self-testing of HIV can be effectively delivered through a website. Such an intervention will also be used by persons with undiagnosed infections and appears to do so at a rate higher than that observed by other means of testing. Self-testing of HIV may therefore help Canada achieve the United Nations 95-95-95 targets.","output":"HIV self-testing in Ottawa, Canada used by persons at risk for HIV: The GetaKit study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge for the rapid discovery of drugs against this life-threatening disease. Owing to the peculiar features of the metal centers that are currently used in medicinal chemistry, metallodrugs might offer an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal. AREAS COVERED Two main strategies for developing metal-based drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 are herein illustrated. Firstly, a few clinically approved metallodrugs could be evaluated in patients according to a 'drug repurposing' approach. To this respect, the gold drug auranofin seems a promising candidate, but some other clinically established metal compounds are worthy of a careful evaluation as well. On the other hand, libraries of inorganic compounds, featuring a large chemical diversity, should be screened to identify the most effective molecules. This second strategy might be assisted by a pathway-driven discovery approach arising from a preliminary knowledge of the mode of action, exploitable to inhibit the functional activities of the key viral proteins. Also, attention must be paid to selectivity and toxicity issues. EXPERT OPINION The medicinal inorganic chemistry community may offer a valuable contribution against COVID-19. The screening of metallodrugs' libraries can expand the explored 'chemical space' and increase the chance of finding effective anti-COVID agents.","output":"Metallo therapeutics for COVID-19.

It acts as an oncogene in most cancers but it inhibits the progression of liver and pancreatic cancers. CARM1 has recently been reported to regulate autophagy, but this function is also context-dependent. However, the effect of CARM1 on gastric cancer (GC) has not been studied. We aimed to explore whether CARM1 was involved in the progression of GC by regulating autophagy. METHODS: The clinical values of CARM1 and autophagy in GC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and western blotting were employed to identify autophagy. The role of CARM1 in GC was investigated by CCK-8, colony formation and flow cytometry assays in vitro and a xenograft model in vivo. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine the interaction of CARM1 and TFE3. RESULTS: CARM1 was upregulated in clinical GC tissues and cell lines, and higher CARM1 expression predicted worse prognosis. CARM1 enhanced GC cell proliferation, facilitated G1-S transition and inhibited ER stress-induced apoptosis by regulating autophagy. Importantly, treatment with a CARM1 inhibitor rescued the tumor-promoting effects of CARM1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CARM1 promoted TFE3 nuclear translocation to induce autophagy through the cytoplasmic AMPK-mTOR and nuclear AMPK-CARM1-TFE3 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: CARM1 promoted GC cell proliferation, accelerated G1-S transition and reduced ER stress-induced apoptosis by regulating autophagy. Mechanistically, CARM1 triggered autophagy by facilitating TFE3 nuclear translocation through the AMPK-mTOR and AMPK-CARM1-TFE3 signaling pathways.","output":"CARM1 promotes gastric cancer progression by regulating TFE3 mediated autophagy enhancement through the cytoplasmic AMPK-mTOR and nuclear AMPK-CARM1-TFE3 signaling pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of antibody. Since experimentation is far easier in vitro, researchers have been sought to develop in vitro assays that are expected to predict activity in vivo. This could be important in both vaccine design and in passive antibody administration. The proposed mechanisms of in vitro neutralization range from those requiring binding of a single antibody molecule to virus to those requiring substantially complete antibody coating of virus. In vitro, antiviral activity can be separated into activity against virions and activity against infected cells. The activity against virions most often considered is neutralization that can be defined as the loss of infectivity, which ensues when antibody molecule(s) bind to a virus particle, and occurs without the involvement of any other agency. In vivo, it is conventional to distinguish phenomenologically between two types of antibody antiviral activity. One of them is the ability of antibody to protect against infection when it is present before or immediately following infection. Evidence for a number of viruses in vitro indicates that lower antibody concentrations are required to inhibit infection propagated by free virus than are required to inhibit infection propagated by cell-to-cell spread.","output":"The antiviral activity of antibodies in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is an important pathogen with a wide spectrum of infection and potential threats to humans and animals. Its replication occurs in the cytoplasm and is closely related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Activation of the three branches of UPR (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6) modulates various signaling pathways, such as innate immune response, microRNA, autophagy, and apoptosis. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between coronavirus and ER stress is helpful to understand the replication and pathogenesis of coronavirus. This paper summarizes the current knowledge of the complex interplay between coronavirus and UPR branches, focuses on the effect of ER stress on coronavirus replication and coronavirus resistance to host innate immunity, and summarizes possible drug targets to regulate the impact of coronavirus infection.","output":"The Role of Unfolded Protein Response in Coronavirus Infection and Its Implications for Drug Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their familys health, the closure of schools, and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in fall 2020.

The majority of students (84.9%) returned to school in person. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18 years) generally reported higher stress indicators as compared to males and younger (age 12-14 years) adolescents. Multivariate analysis showed that stress indicators were positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns (i.e., conduct problems, negative affect, and cognitive/inattention), and that stress arousal (e.g., sleep problems, hypervigilance) accounted for significant variance in behavioural concerns.

The current study aims to test if information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak was related to acute stress disorder (ASD) over and above other psychosocial stressors. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 7800 college students throughout China from January 31 through February 11, 2020. Existing scales were modified to measure ASD and six potential stressors including information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to assess the unique association of information uncertainty with ASD. To minimize the effect of large sample size and also to get a sense of whether the effects of information uncertainty were similar to people at the center of the epidemic, we repeated the hierarchical regression among 10% of the students who were randomly selected from the entire sample (10% random sample; n = 780) and 226 students from Hubei Province where the outbreak started. RESULTS: Information uncertainty was highly prevalent among the respondents (64%). It was significantly associated with ASD beyond other key variables and potential stressors across three samples. In the hierarchical regression among the entire sample, demographic variables accounted for 9.4% of the variance in ASD. The other five stressors added 5.1% of the variance. The information uncertainty ( = .159; p < .001) explained an additional 2.1% of the variance. Likewise, the information uncertainty explained an additional 2.1 and 3.4% of the variance in ASD beyond all other variables among the 10% random sample ( = .165; p < .001) and the Hubei sample ( = .196; p < .01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Information uncertainty is a unique correlate of psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Reducing information uncertainty is essential not only for halting virus transmission but also for mitigating negative impacts of the pandemic on peoples psychosocial wellbeing. Transparent, timely, and accurate communication can reduce public confusion, fear, and stress.

A second regulatory wave (1995-2007) initiated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) orientated working time towards fatigue management and adopted the 14-hour workday. Absorbed by the ILO from 1996, this threshold facilitated the implementation of working time standards for sea workers. The existence of autonomous maritime governance at the ILO and the IMO complemented by the incorporation of the tonnage clause in maritime convention allowed the acceptance of the 14-hour workday system in spite of breaching the universal principles established a century ago. The departure between maritime and land standards show that sectoral interests prevail over labour rights. More decisively, current standards detached labour rights from workers' human nature and attached them directly to sectoral interests.","output":"Working time limits at sea, a hundred-year construction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The events of the last year have highlighted the complexity of implementing large-scale molecular diagnostic testing for novel pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine the chemical influences of sample collection media and storage on the stability and detection of viral nucleic acids by qRT-PCR. We studied the mechanism(s) through which viral transport media (VTM) and number of freeze-thaw cycles influenced the analytical sensitivity of qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our goal is to reinforce testing capabilities and identify weaknesses that could arise in resource-limited environments that do not have well-controlled cold chains. The sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis was studied in four VTM for synthetic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) simulants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The sensitivity and reproducibility of qRT-PCR for the synthetic ssRNA and dsDNA were found to be highly sensitive to VTM with the best results observed for ssRNA in HBSS and PBS-G. Surprisingly, the presence of epithelial cellular material with the ssRNA increased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay. Repeated freeze-thaw cycling decreased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR with two noted exceptions. The choice of VTM is critically important to defining the sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular diagnostics assays and this study suggests they can impact upon the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. This becomes increasingly important if the virus structure is destabilised before analysis, which can occur due to poor storage conditions. This study suggests that COVID-19 testing performed with glycerol-containing PBS will produce a high level of stability and sensitivity. These results are in agreement with clinical studies reported for patient-derived samples.","output":"Influence of viral transport media and freeze-thaw cycling on the sensitivity of qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adulterants in processed food and herbal medicines reduce their safety, quality control, or pharmacological efficacy. Four mistletoe species, including Viscum coloratum, inhabit Korea. Leaves and branches of V. coloratum, defined as edible or medicinal mistletoe species in Korean, are used to prepare Korean herbal medicines as well as leached tea. However, other mistletoe species including Taxillus sutchuenensis var. duclouxii, Korthalsella japonica, and Loranthus tanakae are frequently distributed as authentic V. coloratum in Korean markets because of similarities in the branches morphology and Korean names of these species with V. coloratum. Although herbal medicines and food products prepared from the other mistletoe species are inauthentic, they are sold at high prices because of the rarity of these species. Thus, it is important to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic adulterant mistletoe species. In this study, we developed species-specific primer, based on matK sequences, suitable for both conventional PCR and real time PCR (qPCR) assay. These assays allowed rapid discrimination among all four mistletoe species. Moreover, qPCR assay enabled the detection of trace amounts of adulterant mistletoe species in V. coloratum samples. Furthermore, we used these assays to monitor commercial mistletoe products distributed in Korean markets.

We herein intended to catch the dynamic of Romanian physicians perceptions of COVID-19 impact. For this purpose, after a literature review, a 30-item questionnaire was designed. The questionnaire was twice distributed online, about 1 month apart, during which partial relaxation measures were decreed in Romania. The questionnaire was voluntarily filled in by Romanian physicians who were willing to participate in the study. A total of 214 physicians answered the questionnaire upon its first release, and 199 respondents were registered upon its second release, most of whom (94.9%) were involved in clinical work, with one-third working in units dedicated to COVID-19 patients. In parallel with the relaxation of lockdown measures, along with increased confidence in the efficiency of protective measures (46.7% vs. 31.3%), separation from household members decreased from 36.9% to 22.1%. Nevertheless, the feeling of rejection felt by doctors remained similar (22.4% vs. 24.6%). Furthermore, answers regarding the clinical picture, diagnostic approach, and treatment options are discussed. Most of therapeutic options considered for SARS-CoV-2 treatment (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma) failed to confirm significant efficiency. On the contrary, vaccines for widescale use are already available despite the initial skepticism. In the beginning of the pandemic, 25.2% (18.2% vs. 32.2%) considered that there will not be an effective COVID-19 vaccine, while 41.6% (43.0% vs. 40.2%) thought that a vaccine would be available after at least 12 months. In conclusion, initially, following only a 1 month period, Romanian physicians intention to consider treatments such as hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 decreased significantly.

We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (< 16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

However, concerning the latter, questions remain about their diagnostic and prognostic value and it is not clear whether all patients develop detectable antibodies. We examined sera from 347 Spanish COVID-19 patients, collected during the peak of the epidemic outbreak in Spain, for the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated possible associations with age, sex and disease severity (as measured by duration of hospitalization, kind of respiratory support, treatment in ICU and death). The presence and to some degree the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depended mainly on the amount of time between onset of symptoms and the collection of serum. A subgroup of patients did not develop antibodies at the time of sample collection. Compared to the patients that did, no differences were found. The presence and level of antibodies was not associated with age, sex, duration of hospitalization, treatment in the ICU or death. The case-fatality rate increased exponentially with older age. Neither the presence, nor the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies served as prognostic markers in our cohort. This is discussed as a possible consequence of the timing of the sample collection. Age is the most important risk factor for an adverse outcome in our cohort. Some patients appear not to develop antibodies within a reasonable time frame.

We aimed to determine the effect of hypovitaminosis D correction on the outcome of treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in DME eyes. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 83 eyes of 83 patients with DME were recruited and divided into three groups: normal vitamin D levels + IVB administration (Group 1), vitamin D insufficient/deficient + IVB administration (Group 2), and vitamin D insufficient/deficient + IVB administration + oral vitamin D supplementation (Group 3). Participants were followed for 6 months after the intervention. Visual (corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA) and anatomical (central macular thickness, CMT) outcomes of intervention were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months after three monthly loading doses of IVB were given. Serum vitamin D levels were measured 1 and 6 months after the third IVB administration. RESULTS: A total of 29, 26, and 28 eyes were enrolled in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In months 1, 3, and 6, after the three basic loading doses of IVB, visual acuity and CMT improved in all three groups, but improvements (both functional and anatomical) in groups 1 and 3 in month 6 were more significant than in group 2 (mean CDVA LogMAR changes: ? 0.18  0.03, ? 0.14  0.05, and ? 0.2  0.06; mean CMT reductions: ? 82.24  11.43, ? 66.62  14.34, and ? 86.14  18.36, in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; p < 0.001).

The effects of home confinement, social isolation, cancelled schools, closed businesses, and negative economic impacts have had serious consequences. Hematologic patients (HP) are a subset of highly vulnerable population with increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms due to their immunocompromised status. These risks have been augmented during the COVID outbreak because of deviations from current standards of care, e.g., reduced visits, treatment supply and access to routine exams. This study investigated the impact of the current pandemic on HP assessing demographics, medical information, mental health and caregiver practical management. In collaboration with AIL (Italian Association against Leukemia) and CNR (National Research Council), a survey was generated and distributed to Italian HP. The general population (GP) were used as controls. The assessment used the DASS-21 questionnaire, a self-reported, 21 item screening instrument that provides independent measures of depression, stress and anxiety with recommended severity thresholds subscales. The survey was self-administered between April and August, 2020. The questionnaires' reliability was verified based on an analysis of its internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. As of 30 June 2020, 1113 HP and 1125 GP completed the survey from 20 Italian Regions. The two population groups were homogeneous by age, gender and distribution and included regions at both high (CHP) and low (CLP) prevalence of infections at the time of the survey. HP and GP median age was 50 years (range: HP 11- 93; GP 13-85). 61% HP and 68% GP were female; the rest were male. The year of diagnosis of hematological disease ranged from 1965 to 2020; 21.9% had chronic myeloid leukemia, followed by Hodgkin (15.7%) and non-Hodgkin (15.9%) lymphomas, chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (15.9%), multiple myeloma (8.9%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4.9%), acute myeloid (5.6%) and lymphoblastic (3.25%) leukemias, other (7%). 1071 HP and 1125 GP responded about their occupation as follows: employed full/part time (38.7% HP , 47.7% GP), retired (19.2% HP,10.8% GP), freelancer (9.2% HP, 12.2% GP), unemployed (6.2% HP, 3.4% GP) , students (4.6% HP, 3.2% GP), company executive (4.1% HP, 4.8% GP), manager (2% HP, 4.7 % GP), cooperative member (0.7% HP , 0.7% GP), housewife (8.5% HP 4.8% GP), other (6.8% HP,7.7% GP). During the pandemic 63.7% HP didn't work and 36.3% did work compared to the GP group (33.8% didn't; 66.2 % did). Where specified, the reasons for not working were: layoffs (10.9% HP, 15.9% GP), lack of work (8.1%HP, 15.6 % GP), vacation/ parental leave (4.4% HP, 3.5% GP), reduced business activity for economic reasons (2.2% HP, 3.3% GP), occasional work (2.1% HP, 5.7% GP), seasonal employment, (0.6% HP,1.1 % GP). 625/1073 HP (58.2%) were in active treatment. Of these, 40.1% were in Day Hospital, 56.4% were outpatient; and 3.5% inpatients. The remaining HP were off therapy (448/1073; 41.8%). 1105 HP and 1127 GP responded to the DASS questionnaire. Extremely severe depression was found in 12.9% HP vs 7% GP; 18.1% HP expressed severe anxiety vs 9.6% GP and extremely severe stress was present in 7.1% HP and 5.3% GP. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the internal homogeneity of the questionnaire was 0.95, confirming the cohorts correctness (0.8 or greater, indicates a very good level of reliability). Providing care to HP during the pandemic has been challenging for both patients and doctors. Restrictions on visits and lab/instrumental exams, reduced equipment supply and a paucity of personal protection equipment (PPEs) for health care providers and patients have penalized normal routine care. As a result, 38.2% HP postponed or did not attend scheduled therapy and >50% had difficulty obtaining PPEs through normal sources; 57% in CHP and 36% in CLP regions had to buy them themselves. To our knowledge this is the first report of the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress, work consequences and illness management in HP. Most of HP in this study are outpatients in active treatment. Interesting data emerged from job losses, which is more common among HP.

Four classes of Europeans with mutually exclusive response patterns with respect to their inclusive attitudes towards immigrants were found. The classes were named Inclusive (highly inclusive), Some (selective), Few (highly selective), and Exclusive (highly exclusive). Next, using a network technique, a partial correlation network of 10 basic human values was estimated for each class of participants. The four networks were compared to each other based on three network properties namely: global connectivity, community detection, and assortativity coefficient. The global connectivity (the overall level of interconnections) between the 10 basic values was found to be mostly invariant across the four networks. However, results of the community detection analysis revealed a more complex value structure among the most inclusive class of Europeans.

Methods: This was a single-center, follow-up study, conducted from 1 November 2020, to 22 March 2021. The LUS protocol was based on the assessment of 14 lung zones with a total score up to 42, which was compared to the disease severity and fatality. Results: A total of 133 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR were enrolled, with a median time from hospital admission to lung ultrasound of one day. The LUS score was correlated with clinical severity at hospital admission (Spearmans rho 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.53, p < 0.001). Patients with higher LUS scores were experiencing greater disease severity; a high flow nasal cannula had an odds ratio of 1.43 (5% CI 1.17C1.74) in patients with LUS score > 29; the same score also predicted the need for mechanical ventilation (1.25, [1.07C1.48]).

Identifying and supporting those most affected by the pandemic is required. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on individuals with tinnitus and to identify mediating factors. Methods: This is a mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online survey from 3,103 individuals with tinnitus from 48 countries. The greatest representation was from North America (49%) and Europe (47%) and other countries were only marginally represented. Results: Although the study was aimed at those with pre-existing tinnitus, 7 individuals reported having COVID-19 initiated tinnitus. Having COVID-19 symptoms exacerbated tinnitus in 40% of respondents, made no change in 54%, and improved tinnitus in 6%. Other mediating factors such as the social and emotional consequences of the pandemic made pre-existing tinnitus more bothersome for 32% of the respondents, particularly for females and younger adults, better for 1%, and caused no change to tinnitus for 67%. Pre-existing tinnitus was significantly exacerbated for those self-isolating, experiencing loneliness, sleeping poorly, and with reduced levels of exercise. Increased depression, anxiety, irritability, and financial worries further significantly contributed to tinnitus being more bothersome during the pandemic period. Conclusions: These findings have implications for tinnitus management, because they highlight the diverse response both internal and external factors have on tinnitus levels.

Shenzhen confirmed its first imported case from Wuhan on 19 January 2020. However, little is known regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in these imported cities. METHODOLOGY: Data of all 417 confirmed cases diagnosed in Shenzhen before 29 February were collected. The epidemiological characteristics of imported and local cases were compared. The resilience to COVID-19 was evaluated by discharge density. RESULTS: All ten districts reported COVID-19 cases by 29 February, including 331 imported and 86 local cases. The Pearson linear correlation model showed the number of confirmed cases (r = 0.990, p < 0.001) as well as incidence of COVID-19 (r = 0.766, p = 0.010) was positively correlated with the gross domestic product of district. Family clusters were more commonly found in local cases. Imported patients had earlier onset (p < 0.001) and diagnosis (p < 0.001), but longer interval from onset to admission (p = 0.030), diagnosis (p = 0.003) and discharge (p = 0.016). Older and severe cases had lower discharge density (0.024 and 0.018, respectively); while cases with subclinical symptoms exhibited higher discharge density (0.052). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients were predominantly imported cases in Shenzhen and the spatial distribution was closely related to district GDP.

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of the pandemic on functional prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients hospitalised due to acute ischaemic stroke in Aragon (Spain). MATERIL AND METHODS: We reviewed the data of all patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke to any hospital in our regional healthcare system between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020. We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Exacerbation prediction algorithms are based on a decision tree model constructed from percentage thresholds for disease state changes in patient-reported wellbeing, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Our study determined the validity of COPDPredict? to identify exacerbations and provide timely notifications to patients and clinicians compared to clinician-defined episodes. METHODS: In a 6-month prospective observational study, 90 patients with COPD and frequent exacerbations registered wellbeing self-assessments daily using COPDPredict? App and measured FEV(1) using connected spirometers. CRP was measured using finger-prick testing. RESULTS: Wellbeing self-assessment submissions showed 98% compliance. Ten patients did not experience exacerbations and treatment was unchanged. A total of 112 clinician-defined exacerbations were identified in the remaining 80 patients: 52 experienced 1 exacerbation; 28 had 2.20.4 episodes. Sixty-two patients self-managed using prescribed rescue medication. In 14 patients, exacerbations were more severe but responded to timely escalated treatment at home. Four patients attended the emergency room; with 2 hospitalised for <72 hours. Compared to the 6 months pre-COPDPredict?, hospitalisations were reduced by 98% (90 vs 2, p<0.001). COPDPredict? identified COPD-related exacerbations at 7, 3 days (median, IQR) prior to clinician-defined episodes, sending appropriate alerts to patients and clinicians. Cross-tabulation demonstrated sensitivity of 97.9% (95% CI 95.7C99.2), specificity of 84.0% (95% CI 82.6C85.3), positive and negative predictive value of 38.4% (95% CI 36.4C40.4) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.5C99.9), respectively. CONCLUSION: High sensitivity indicates that if there is an exacerbation, COPDPredict? informs patients and clinicians accurately. The high negative predictive value implies that when an exacerbation is not indicated by COPDPredict?, risk of an exacerbation is low. Thus, COPDPredict? provides safe, personalised, preventative care for patients with COPD.","output":"Validation of COPDPredict?: Unique Combination of Remote Monitoring and Exacerbation Prediction to Support Preventative Management of COPD Exacerbations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: In the aftermath of COVID-19, it sounds equally important, on the part of mental health providers to undertake the onerous duty of promoting resilience, to empower individuals, foster their own natural strengths, and help them incorporate new coping strategies into their everyday lives at this exceptional moment of hardship.","output":"Eudemonia and Mental Bienaise in the Wake of COVID-19!: A Decalogue for Building Up Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is a prominent cause of mortality globally, and it becomes fatal and incurable if it is delayed in diagnosis.

BACKGROUND Increasing evidence demonstrates that bariatric surgery can dramatically ameliorate type 2 diabetes. Not surprisingly, gastrointestinal operations are now being used throughout the world to treat diabetes in association with obesity, and increasingly, for diabetes alone. However, the role for surgery in diabetes treatment is not clearly defined and there are neither clear guidelines for these practices nor sufficient plans for clinical trials to evaluate the risks and benefits of such \\"diabetes surgery.\\" METHODS A multidisciplinary group of 50 voting delegates from around the world gathered in Rome, Italy for the first International Conference on Gastrointestinal Surgery to Treat Type 2 Diabetes--(the \\"Diabetes Surgery Summit\\"). During the meeting, available scientific evidence was examined and critiqued by the entire group to assess the strength of evidence and to draft consensus statements. Through an iterative process, draft statements were then serially discussed, debated, edited, reassessed, and finally presented for formal voting. After the Rome meeting, statements that achieved consensus were summarized and distributed to all voting delegates for further input and final approval. These statements were then formally critiqued by representatives of several sientific societies at the 1st World Congress on Interventional Therapies for T2DM (New York, Sept 2008). Input from this discussion was used to generate the current position statement. RESULTS A Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS) Position Statement consists of recommendations for clinical and research issues, as well as general concepts and definitions in diabetes surgery. The DSS recognizes the legitimacy of surgical approaches to treat diabetes in carefully selected patients. For example, gastric bypass was deemed a reasonable treatment option for patients with poorly controlled diabetes and a body mass index > or =30 kg/m. Clinical trials to investigate the exact role of surgery in patients with less severe obesity and diabetes are considered a priority. Furthermore, investigations on the mechanisms of surgical control of diabetes are strongly encouraged, as they may help advance the understanding of diabetes pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS The DSS consensus document embodies the foundations of \\"diabetes surgery,\\" and represents a timely attempt by leading scholars to improve access to surgical options supported by sound evidence, while also preventing harm from inappropriate use of unproven procedures.","output":"The Diabetes Surgery Summit consensus conference: recommendations for the evaluation and use of gastrointestinal surgery to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To systematically identify and quantify the - and -lactones in Cheddar cheeses, 20 samples from three sources (Ireland, the UK and the USA) were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), aroma extract dilution analysis, aroma recombination analysis, and aroma addition/omission analysis.

Patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors were evaluated for prognostic effect on hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS) and overall survival (OS) using unadjusted and propensity score-weighted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Median HPFS and OS were 18.5 and 125.1 months for G1 (n = 75), 12.2 and 33.9 months for G2 (n = 60), and 4.9 and 9.3 months for G3 tumors (n = 20), respectively (p < 0.05). Tumor burden >50 % hepatic volume demonstrated 5.5- and 26.8-month shorter median HPFS and OS, respectively, versus burden 50 % (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in HPFS or OS between gut or pancreas primaries. In multivariate HPFS analysis, there were no significant differences among embolotherapy modalities. In multivariate OS analysis, TARE had a higher hazard ratio than TACE (unadjusted Cox model: HR 2.1, p = 0.02; propensity score adjusted model: HR 1.8, p = 0.11), while TAE did not differ significantly from TACE.

RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 228,873 HCWs were included in the final analysis. Total number of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and unvaccinated HCWs were 132,922, 155,673 and 17505, respectively. Overall pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections among partially/fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.5). Among partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs, pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections was 3.7% (95% CI 1.8-7.3), 1.3% (95% CI 0.6-2.9), and 10.1% (95% CI 4.5-19.5), respectively. DISCUSSION: Our analysis shows the risk of COVID-19 infection in both partially and fully vaccinated HCWs remains exceedingly low when compared to unvaccinated individuals. There remains an urgent need for all frontline HCWs to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers: A Systematic Review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The predicament arising from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become one of the most significant modern public health challenges. Despite uncertainties in the viral determinants and pathogenesis, it is crucial to accurately inspect all available evidence to construct accurate clinical guidelines for optimised patient care. This study aims to discuss the available evidence for the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against COVID-19. Early in vitro studies of CQ/HCQ against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are convincing. But contradictory evidence exists on the clinical use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with azithromycin. As of now, there is no compelling clinical evidence on CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in COVID-19 and the available evidence is limited to methodologically inferior non-randomised studies. Studies have also shown detrimental drug reactions to CQ and 'HCQ plus azithromycin', mainly cardiac side effects in hospitalised patients with coexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. Therefore, we recommend that physicians avoid high doses and exercise extreme caution in the compassionate use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.","output":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a repurposed agent against COVID-19: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic started, the world continues to adapt to the profound effects that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had on our lives.

At the molecular level, the hallmark of sepsis is the elevated expression of a multitude of potent cytokines, i.e. a cytokine storm. For sepsis involving gram-negative bacteria, macrophages recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shed from the bacteria, activating Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4), and triggering a cytokine storm. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a highly active kinase that has been implicated in LPS-induced cytokine production. Thus, compounds that inhibit GSK-3 could be potential therapeutics for sepsis. Our group has recently described a novel and highly selective inhibitor of GSK-3 termed COB-187. In the present study, using THP-1 macrophages, we evaluated the ability of COB-187 to attenuate LPS-induced cytokine production. We found that COB-187 significantly reduced, at the protein and mRNA levels, cytokines induced by LPS (e.g. IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IL-1?, CXCL10, and IFN-?). Further, the data suggest that the inhibition could be due, at least in part, to COB-187 reducing NF-&#954;B (p65/p50) DNA binding activity as well as reducing IRF-3 phosphorylation at Serine 396. Thus, COB-187 appears to be a potent inhibitor of the cytokine storm induced by LPS.","output":"Modulation of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production by a novel glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The order Carnivora includes over 300 species that vary many orders of magnitude in size and inhabit all major biomes, from tropical rainforests to polar seas.

As the pandemic spread throughout Italy, mental health concerns increased for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are at greater risk. The aim was to pilot a Telehealth Psychological Support Intervention for pwCF and caregivers to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety during the lockdown in Italy in March 2020. METHODS: This intervention utilized cognitive behavioral skills (e.g., cognitive reframing). Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ\\\\8 and GAD\\\\7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. RESULTS: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre\\\\ to post\\\\testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = ?4.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = ?5.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%C40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NSnon\\\\significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: M = 6.4 to post: M = 5.1, t(14) = ?2.5, p < .05), but not anxiety (pre: M = 8.1 to post: M = 7.9, t(14) = ?0.2, p = NS). Feasibility and Satisfaction were positive. CONCLUSION: This telehealth intervention yielded reductions in stress and depression for participants.

Viral pneumonia is a severe complication of COVID-19. AIM: Due to the high prevalence of this disease globally, especially in Iran, the aim of this study was to determine the clinical features of seven patients with probable COVID-19 infected pneumonia in Rasht, North Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case series study, we described the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of seven patients with probable COVID-19 infected pneumonia at Razi Hospital, Rasht, north of Iran, from February 27 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: In this study, the most common clinical symptoms during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 were poor appetite (seven cases), dehydration (seven cases), cough (six cases), dyspnea (six cases), fatigue (six cases), fever above 38C (five cases), myalgia (five cases), Chills (five cases), feeling fever (five cases), sore throat (five cases), and nausea (five cases), respectively. The average body temperature in these patients was 39.32C. In laboratory findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in three patients. Contrary to most of the evidence, C-reactive protein was not elevated in five patients. All patients received antibiotic and antiviral medications and received symptomatic treatment. Finally, four patients responded to the treatments and were discharged from the hospital; two patients were still hospitalized and only one patient died.

Tannins are known for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties in the gastro-enteric tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oral administration of chestnut tannins (Castanea sativa Mill.) in order to reduce the duration of calf neonatal diarrhea. Twenty-four Italian Friesian calves affected by neonatal diarrhea were included. The duration of the diarrheic episode (DDE) was recorded and the animals were divided into a control group (C), which received Effydral? in 2 l of warm water, and a tannin-treated group (T), which received Effydral? in 2 l of warm water plus 10 g of extract of chestnut tannins powder. A Mann-Whitney test was performed to verify differences for the DDE values between the two groups. RESULTS: The DDE was significantly higher in group C than in group T (p = 0.02), resulting in 10.1  3.2 and 6.6  3.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Phytotherapic treatments for various diseases have become more common both in human and in veterinary medicine, in order to reduce the presence of antibiotic molecules in the food chain and in the environment. Administration of tannins in calves with diarrhea seemed to shorten the DDE in T by almost 4 days compared to C, suggesting an effective astringent action of chestnut tannins in the calf, as already reported in humans.

This group, along with those with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes, have accounted for 80% of hospitalizations and an even higher percentage of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA. West Virginia, the only state in the USA located completely within Appalachia, has a higher percentage of elderly than all but two states in the nation. Rural seniors are hesitant to use hospital emergency departments and attend routine care visits for fear of exposure to the virus. Restricted cell phone and internet service may limit effective technological outreach to more isolated rural older adults. More information is needed to develop effective, safe, and acceptable approaches to care for rural, isolated older adults. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with 124 community-dwelling residents in four counties in rural Appalachia between 1 and 22 April 2020. Participants were aged 75 years or older. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine for associations among variables. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 86 (69.4%) women and 38 (30.6%) men with an average age of 82.5 years. Telephone contact was the preferred method of contact among all but four participants (96.8%). Seventeen calls (13.7%) resulted in some form of intervention, including arranging for emergent home repairs, treatment of severe hypertension, scheduling urgent laboratory testing, arranging for terminal care, treating acute conditions, and providing durable medical equipment. The 17 participants requiring intervention were significantly more likely to be aged 85 years or older (p=0.004), and report two or more chronic conditions (p<0.001). Those describing themselves as 'lonely' were significantly more likely to live alone (p=0.009) and describe themselves as 'anxious' or 'depressed' (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A telephone call appears to be the most effective means of communication with patients in these rural Appalachian counties. Patients aged 85 years or older and those living alone should be given highest priority for regular outreach by healthcare providers. In this population, systematically calling rural elderly patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and its aftermath represents an effective strategy for providers who care for elderly rural patients.","output":"Ensuring contact: calling rural Appalachian older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is substantial interest in using presenting symptoms to prioritize testing for COVID-19 and establish symptom-based surveillance.

Machine learning has been used in the past to investigate discussions surrounding substance use on Reddit, and this study leverages similar techniques to identify risky content from discussions of fentanyl on this platform. METHODS: A codebook was developed by clinical domain experts with 12 categories indicative of fentanyl misuse risk, and this was used to manually label 391 Reddit posts and comments. Using this data, we built machine learning classification models to identify fentanyl risk. RESULTS: Our machine learning risk model was able to detect posts or comments labeled as risky by our clinical experts with 76% accuracy and 76% sensitivity. Furthermore, we provide a vocabulary of community-specific, colloquial words for fentanyl and its analogues. DISCUSSION: This study uses an interdisciplinary approach leveraging machine learning techniques and clinical domain expertise to automatically detect risky discourse, which may elicit and benefit from timely intervention. Moreover, our vocabulary of online terms for fentanyl and its analogues expands our understanding of online street nomenclature for opiates.

Some suggest gastric ischaemic preconditioning may reduce ischaemic complications. We discuss our series of 155 consecutive minimally invasive oesophagectomies (MIOs), including a number of cases of gastric tube ischaemia, of which 4 (2.6%) developed conduit necrosis. METHODS Data were collected prospectively of MIOs carried out by a single surgeon between 2005 and 2011. Cases of gastric tube necrosis were identified. RESULTS Overall, 155 patients were identified. The inpatient mortality rate was 2.6%. Gastric tube necrosis occurred in four patients (2.6%). An ultrasonic dissector injury to the gastroepiploic arcade had occurred in two cases. In another case, the gastric tube was strangulated in the hiatus. In the remaining case, no clear mechanical cause was identified. All 4 cases occurred within the first 73 cases. The gastric tube necrosis rate of the first 50 cases versus cases 51-155 was 4% and 2% respectively (p=0.5948). The anastomotic leak rate in these two cohorts was 18% and 7% respectively (p=0.0457). There was a significant reduction in overall gastric tube complications from 22% to 10% following the learning curve of the initial 50 cases (p=0.0447). CONCLUSIONS In our series, gastric tube necrosis appears to be a learning curve issue. Prophylactic measures such as ischaemic preconditioning become less relevant as the operating surgeon's experience increases. Instead, meticulous attention to preserving the gastroepiploic arcade, avoidance of tension in the tube and careful positioning of the gastric conduit through an adequately sized hiatus are key factors.","output":"Gastric tube necrosis following minimally invasive oesophagectomy is a learning curve issue."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Memory consolidation involves the reactivation of memory traces during sleep. If many memories are reactivated each night, how much do they interfere with one another? To explore this question, we examined whether reactivating multiple memories incurs a cost to sleep-related benefits by contrasting reactivation of multiple memories versus single memories during sleep. First, participants learned the on-screen location of different images. Each image was part of a semantically interconnected group (e.g., images of different cats). Groups were comprised of either one, two, or six images. During sleep, group-related sounds (e.g., meow) were unobtrusively presented to reactivate memories for half of the groups. The benefit in location recall for cued versus non-cued items was independent of the number of items in the group, suggesting that reactivation occurs in a simultaneous, promiscuous manner. Intriguingly, sleep spindles and delta-theta power modulations were sensitive to group size and reflected the extent of previous learning. Our results demonstrate that multiple memories may be consolidated in parallel without compromising each memorys sleep-related benefit, suggesting that the brains capacity for reactivation is not strictly limited by separate resources needed for individual memories. These findings highlight alternative models for parallel consolidation that should be considered in future studies.","output":"Multiple memories can be simultaneously reactivated during sleep as effectively as a single memory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations (Exon20ins) account for 4-12% of all EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

Coordinating activities and integrating newer with older ways of treating patients while delivering high-quality, safe care, is challenging. Three landmark reports in 2018 led by (1) the Lancet Global Health Commission, (2) a coalition of the World Health Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank, and (3) the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine of the United States propose that health systems need to tackle care quality, create less harm and provide universal health coverage in all nations, but especially low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to review these reports with the aim of advancing the discussion beyond a conceptual diagnosis of quality gaps into identification of practical opportunities for transforming health systems by 2030. MAIN BODY: We analysed the reports via text-mining techniques and content analyses to derive their key themes and concepts. Initiatives to make progress include better measurement, using the capacities of information and communications technologies, taking a systems view of change, supporting systems to be constantly improving, creating learning health systems and undergirding progress with effective research and evaluation. Our analysis suggests that the world needs to move from 2018, the year of reports, to the 2020s, the decade of action. We propose three initiatives to support this move: first, developing a blueprint for change, modifiable to each countrys circumstances, to give effect to the reports recommendations; second, to make tangible steps to reduce inequities within and across health systems, including redistributing resources to areas of greatest need; and third, learning from what goes right to complement current efforts focused on reducing things going wrong. We provide examples of targeted funding which would have major benefits, reduce inequalities, promote universality and be better at learning from successes as well as failures. CONCLUSION: The reports contain many recommendations, but lack an integrated, implementable, 10-year action plan for the next decade to give effect to their aims to improve care to the most vulnerable, save lives by providing high-quality healthcare and shift to measuring and ensuring better systems- and patient-level outcomes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate VDD and COVID-19 mortality worldwide during the first 50 days of the pandemic as experienced by each country. Methods Country-specific VDD prevalence among older adults was evaluated according to a systematic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SCOPUS during April 2020. Data were obtained from the public Our World in Data database which reports COVID-19 mortality from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and country population characteristics, size and proportion of the population greater than 65 years, from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Country-specific cumulative mortality was modeled via negative binomial random coefficient growth curve models. Results Among 29 countries included in this analysis, VDD prevalence among older adults ranged from 6.9% in Canada to 69% in France. Cumulative COVID-19 deaths up to day 50 within each country, modeled via exponential growth curves, demonstrated an association with country-level VDD (p = 0.0538). However, the association was not robust when controlling for proportion of older adults in each country (p = 0.2135). Conclusions This ecological analysis is further evidence for VDD correction as a component of COVID-19 treatment, especially among older individuals. Inclusion of data cross-culturally (i.e., collected from countries worldwide) supports the theory that VDD is a universal mechanism contributing to COVID-19 mortality.

Because of the lockdown measures taken to limit the virus spread in Italy, in-person teaching and learning have been interrupted in all health care disciplines and readapted in virtual formulae. METHODS: As academic ophthalmology departments, we had to maintain the educational needs of medical and orthoptic students, internships, surgical training of residents, as well as to cover the scientific update of health care personnel (HCPs), and the continuation of research and academic activities. To assure these needs we ideated an educational strategy and a team, which was then translated on a multichannel virtual platform created with Microsoft Teams. RESULTS: In this platform there were 21 channels organized in a public view mode, open to all Team members, or in private view mode to separate non-permanent HCPs, internships, residents, and students tasks, from permanent HCPs tasks. Virtual channels were dedicated to provide theoretical lessons, clinical cases, surgical video, internal meetings and webinar, to offer news from scientific societies, requests of appointments from biomedical companies, links with ophthalmological websites, to move forward research projects, to participate at institutional academic duties, and to obtain feedbacks from users. Residents continued their training on surgery using a surgical simulator, after consulting an agenda uploaded into the dedicated virtual channel.

OBSERVATION 100 patients of CAM (cases) and 150 patients of COVID-19 without mucormycosis (controls) were included in the study. The spectrum of involvement of CAM cases included rhino-sinus (n=98, 98%), rhino orbital (n=58, 58%), rhino-orbito-cerebral (n=29, 29%). In CAM group symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean of 13.46 days after onset of COVID-19. The mean age of the CAM study group was 51.16 years with 69 males (69%) and 31 females (31.0). The most frequent comorbidities seen in our study population was diabetes (n=113, 45.2%) and hypertension (n=54, 21.6%). Diabetes was significantly more frequent among cases than controls (89% vs 24%, p <0.001). 31% of patients in CAM case group showed a common practise of steam inhalation during covid illness. Most common symptom reported in CAM was related to the eye which included eye pain (58%), lid swelling (54%), eye swelling (47%). Sino-nasal symptoms were nasal discharge (25%), nasal stuffiness (21%), and epistaxis (4%). Other common symptoms were headache (51%) and facial pain (36%). On examination of nasal cavity, crusting and ulceration were present in 83% patients. Eye involvement was present in 60% of cases, of which 27% of cases had vision loss. For definitive diagnosis of CAM, Potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount was positive for aseptate hyphae in 31 patients (31%). Use of systemic steroids for the management of COVID-19, was more frequent in CAM case group than control group (n=70, 70%). The CAM case group showed mean Hba1c of 10.7  2.45, mean Serum Iron levels was 49.01  18.69, mean ferritin was 913.37, mean CRP was 131.56 and mean LDH was 428.70. CONCLUSION Overzealous use of steroids, uncontrolled sugars and repeated steam inhalation provided a favourable environment for the growth of mucormycosis. Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis.","output":"Coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis (CAM): A case control study during the outbreak in India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a widespread global pandemic with nearly 185 million confirmed cases and about four million deaths. It is caused by an infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which primarily affects the alveolar type II pneumocytes. The infection induces pathological responses including increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This situation results in impaired gas exchange, hypoxia, and other sequelae that lead to multisystem organ failure and death. As summarized in this article, many interventions and therapeutics have been proposed and investigated to combat the viral infection-induced inflammation and oxidative stress that contributes to the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, these methods have not significantly improved treatment outcomes. This may partly be attributable to their inability at restoring redox and inflammatory homeostasis, for which molecular hydrogen (H(2)), an emerging novel medical gas, may complement. Herein, we systematically review the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms of H(2). Its small molecular size and nonpolarity allow H(2) to rapidly diffuse through cell membranes and penetrate cellular organelles. H(2) has been demonstrated to suppress NF-B inflammatory signaling and induce the Nrf2/Keap1 antioxidant pathway, as well as to improve mitochondrial function and enhance cellular bioenergetics. Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of H(2) in varying diseases, including COVID-19. However, the exact mechanisms, primary modes of action, and its true clinical effects remain to be delineated and verified. Accordingly, additional mechanistic and clinical research into this novel medical gas to combat COVID-19 complications is warranted.","output":"Combating Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in COVID-19 by Molecular Hydrogen Therapy: Mechanisms and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Between 25%-50% of patients hospitalized with (COVID-19) suffer cardiovascular events. Limited information is available to identify those at greatest risk for cardiac complications. Objectives Objectives were to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events (CE); analyze whether risk factors and outcomes were influenced by race; and analyze survival differences among various groups. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were heart failure (HF), deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between different variables. Multiple logistics regression analyses were conducted to examine which variables predict cardiovascular events for the entire cohort, African American patients, and white patients, respectively. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. Results Of 700 COVID-19 positive inpatients, 126 experienced cardiovascular events and 574 did not. The incidence of cardiovascular events in our sample population was 18%. As shown in Table 1, we found the following factors were highly associated with the odds of new-onset of CEs: advanced age in years, males, non-Hispanic African American, presence of comorbidities, and decreased saturation levels. Numerous laboratory values were significantly associated with the risk of CEs (Table 1). African Americans had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively). However, multiple logistics analysis was used to examine the joint effect of the risk factors which suggested that lower serum albumin and neoplastic/immune compromised diseases count were highly associated with CEs for African American COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.001, p=0.044, respectively). SaO2/FiO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with CEs for white inpatients (p=<0.001, p=0.007, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed inpatients with CEs had a much higher mortality rate than those without CEs (45.2% vs. 8.7%). Median survival for patients with CEs was 18 days as opposed to 100 days for those that did not experience CEs. African Americans with CEs experienced higher mortality than those without CEs (43.9% vs. 7.8%). White COVID-19 inpatients' mortality rates were 46.3% and 9.0% for those with and without CEs, respectively. Of the 126 COVID-19 inpatients who had a CE, 14.3% had cardiac arrhythmias and 8.7% had new onset of HF diagnoses, and 4.8% had acute myocardial infarctions. Conclusion Multiple risk factors for CEs and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs. HF, cardiac arrhythmia, and acute myocardial infarction were the most frequently cited CEs implicating the need for long-term follow-up.","output":"P014.

The current study has been designed to investigate the major SARS-CoV-2 variants and emerging mutations in virus structural and non-structural proteins (NSP) during the fourth wave in September 2021 from the Punjab province of Pakistan. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples have been collected from major cities were subjected to next-generation sequencing. Among the 20 whole genomes (GenBank Accession SRR16294858-SRR16294877), 2 samples failed to be completely sequenced. These genome sequences harbored 207 non-synonymous mutations, among which 19 were unique to GISAID. The genome sequences were detected: Delta 21I, 21J variants (B.1.617.2).

In this large observational study, we evaluated the incidence and the risk factors associated with CMV reactivation and its effects on mortality in a large cohort of patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to three ICUs from February 2020 to July 2021 were included. The patients were screened at ICU admission and once or twice per week for quantitative CMV-DNAemia in the blood. The risk factors associated with CMV blood reactivation and its association with mortality were estimated by adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: CMV blood reactivation was observed in 88 patients (20.4%) of the 431 patients studied. Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score (HR 1031, 95% CI 1010C1053, p = 0.006), platelet count (HR 0.0996, 95% CI 0.993C0.999, p = 0.004), invasive mechanical ventilation (HR 2611, 95% CI 1223C5571, p = 0.013) and secondary bacterial infection (HR 5041; 95% CI 2852C8911, p < 0.0001) during ICU stay were related to CMV reactivation.

To estimate national hospital charges and rates of in-hospital deaths for a greater number of specific BDs than estimated in previous reports, investigators at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and CDC used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), developed and distributed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

After the first wave, several countries, notably in the European Union, are suffering a very rapid increase in the number of cases in the pandemic second wave. Health systems are under stress; hospital beds and ICU beds are increasingly occupied by COVID-19 patients, and hospitals are struggling to keep their normal operations. We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission. The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often. They include also targeted restrictions in people's mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe once more in the current strong second wave. Waiting for effective and safe vaccines and treatments, stopping the ongoing COVID-19 transmission is our only defense wall. We do not know yet which strategy or strategies worked best.

It was tried in this study to systematically review the challenges and prerequisites, strategies, and measures related to the retention of health workers during the disaster. Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-synthesis of all the articles related to the factors affecting the retention of human resources during the Covid-19 disaster. The articles were searched using the keywords Retention, Human resource, and COVID-19 in the following databases without a time limit: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science. To select the studies, the titles, abstracts, and full texts that complied with the inclusion criteria of the present systematic review were examined, and the 226 preliminary results and abstract were screened. Finally, 23 full texts were obtained, and regarding the type and nature of the materials extracted from the studies, a meta-synthesis was used to analyze and aggregate the results of the systematic review. Results: The 23 articles included in the systematic review and meta-synthesis were reviewed, and the effects of the Covid-19 disaster on the healthcare staff and the retention strategies were considered as the main themes of the study. In this regard, stigma and violence against the staff, burnout and stress, increased staff workload, acquisition of communication skills, employees' mental and physical health, employee safety during disaster, staff mobilization to assist the current forces, expansion of cyberspace infrastructures, and motivational-health incentives were selected as codes. Conclusion: Retention or non-retention of the personnel during or after a disaster can be caused by the multifaceted effects of the crisis on people.

Material and Methods: An online questionnaire was circulated among Indian dermatologists which included participant demographics, changes in their practice and teaching during COVID-19, use of virtual or e-health technologies, and attitudes/opinions on their experiences. We also wanted to understand doctor perspectives on their own roles, wellness, and hospital responses to the pandemic. Results: A total of 260 responses from qualified dermatologists of different parts of India were received between 1st and 8th April 2020 and were analyzed. Two-thirds of the respondents were within 10 years of starting practice. Virtual consultations have increased by almost three-fold during the pandemic, which is a major change noticed in the practice when we compare before and during the pandemic. Earlier the focus of teledermatology (TD) was mainly for follow-up care (85%), whereas during the pandemic, both new and follow-up patients were provided virtual consultations. The number of patients coming to them for a consultation has drastically reduced. Only 2% of the responders are still performing minor procedures with proper care. Almost two-thirds do not have systems in place to train their residents and fellows due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. The rest of them have started to take the virtual route of teaching through webinars, virtual rounds, and providing access to online journals to continue their teaching. Only 18.6% of dermatologists at work were provided with personal protective equipment. TD has opened new doors to virtual consultation and it was evident that 54.4% of doctors are willing to continue it in the future even after the pandemic is over. Conclusion: TD platforms hold great promise to improve access to high-quality dermatologic care in the future. Results from this survey of Indian dermatologists suggest that TD is the future of dermatology as it will be accessed by patients in remote areas and it is a cost-effective move for the patients.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Dermatology Practice in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many large nations have failed to adequately protect their indigenous populations from COVID-19, a novel disease which has challenged overarching nation-states to develop plans that are politically acceptable to and effective for heterogeneous populations These failures of the nation-state to adequately protect citizens have endangered indigenous communities but also opened a space for indigenous solidarity, organization, and institution building The residents of Spiti Valley of Northern India initially attempted to organize against COVID-19 through the secular mechanisms of government in their district When residents lost trust in their ability to work through official channels, monasteries transcended traditional and contemporary boundaries to cooperate with each other in developing the Committee for Preventive Measures and Sustainable Development (CPMSD) The CPMSD has successfully warded off COVID-19 through a variety of measures, including limiting incoming traffic, quarantine, education, contact tracing, and social distancing In the process, the Spiti Valley has revitalized traditional structures of governance Public health practitioners should carefully document how indigenous (and other) communities organize to combat COVID-19 This data C which may reveal practical as opposed to formal networks of authority C may assist current and future public health practitioners to decide how and with whom to invest scarce human resources [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Critical Public Health is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Buddhist Monks as community organizers: an indigenous response to COVID-19 in the Spiti Valley of Northern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing a malnutrition crisis One billion people are hungry, at least 3 billion do not receive sufficient nutrients and more than 2 5 billion consume unhealthy diets (UNICEF, WHO and World Bank, 2018) In addition to its immediate impact on health and society, the COVID-19 pandemic will cause significant short- and long-term disruptions to food systems This will reduce the availability of nutritious foods, particularly for poor and vulnerable populations, and fuel the prevalence of all forms of malnutrition Malnutrition results in the intergenerational transmission of inequity, poverty and poor health and poses a significant barrier to equitable and sustainable social and economic development The data-collection step in the value chain is, perhaps, the most important and requires the establishment of high-quality national and subnational systems to collect reliable information Yet, many nutrition issues still lack dependable data This is the case for micronutrient deficiencies, which are still poorly understood in most countries due to vast data gaps","output":"Using cutting-edge technology to end malnutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The association between sleep and adiposity (indexed by body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio) has typically been evaluated using a single dimension of self-reported sleep.

DESIGN Longitudinal study with 11-14 years of follow-up time between the sleep health assessment and body mass index / waist-to-hip ratio measurements. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and twenty-one midlife women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. MEASUREMENTS Multidimensional sleep health was quantified using actigraphy (M[SD] = 29.1[7.2] nights) measures of sleep efficiency, midpoint, duration, regularity, and self-report measures of alertness and satisfaction. Each component was dichotomized and summed; higher values indicated better sleep health. Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured at the sleep study and at follow-up.

This is manifested in an increased prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. As older adults are more vulnerable and severely affected by the pandemic, they may be at increased psychological risk when seeking to protect themselves from COVID-19. Methods: Our study aims to quantify the association between the stringency of measures and increased feelings of sadness/depression in a sample of 31,819 Europeans and Israelis aged 65 and above. We hypothesize that more stringent measures make it more likely that individuals will report increased feelings of sadness or depression. Conclusions: We found that more stringent measures across countries in Europe and Israel affect the mental health of older individuals. The prevalence of increased feelings of sadness/depression was higher in Southern European countries, where the measures were more stringent.

METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric study including all patients with NLUTD who had undergone PNLT between 2005 and 2017. Pre-operative clinical data (neurological condition, voiding mode, preoperative urine culture ), peri-operative and post-operative data (success and morbidity) were collected from the patients' charts. Success was defined by the absence of residual fragment (RF), on imaging or intraoperative endoscopy. Partial efficacy was defined by the presence of RF lower than 4mm. Early complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: In all, 53 PNLTs were performed, in 35 patients, mostly with spinal cord injury. The success and partial efficacy rates were 66.0% and 71.7% respectively. The failure rate was correlated with increased stone burden (P=0.03), increased size of the largest stone (P=0.02), and the presence of complex stones (P<0.02). The rate of early complications was 41.5%, with 27.3% major, mostly septic, and bleeding. The retreatment rate within 3 years was 41.5%. CONCLUSION: In patients with NLUTD, PNLT allows a high success rate, but with a significant rate of retreatment and infectious complications. However, NLPC remains the gold standard in this population, especially for renal stones larger 20mm, allowing a higher success rate than ureteroscopy and a lower retreatment rate.","output":"[Safety and efficacy of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with neurogenic bladder]./ Nphrolithotomie percutane chez les patients neurologiques : efficacit et morbidit  long terme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Plasma-derived intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain a dynamic spectrum of immunoglobulin (Ig) G reactivities reflective of the donor population from which they are derived.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data was extracted from accessible databases, including the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status, antibody titre in convalescent and vaccinated groups and antibody half-life. Together, these parameters were used to create an integrated mathematical model that could be used to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in future IVIg preparations. RESULTS: We predict that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration will peak in batches produced in mid-October 2021, containing levels in the vicinity of 190-fold that of the mean convalescent (unvaccinated) plasma concentration. An elevated concentration (approximately 35-fold convalescent plasma) is anticipated to be retained in batches produced well into 2022. Measurement of several Privigen batches using the Phadia(?)

This study examines the perceptions and attitudes of small family farmers toward climate change and identifies adaptation strategies supporting household food security in the Middle Eastern context, Lebanon. The study uses cross-sectional, primary data of households that own small family farms in the Central Bekaa region. The results show that the majority of the households believe that climate change is occurring, has adverse impacts on livelihoods, and is attributable to human factors. They perceived an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall patterns over the last 20 years. In response, the households used multiple agricultural practices to adapt to climate change. Based on the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) scores, only 7.5% of the households were food secure, while 89% were mild to moderately food insecure. Generally, the households had modest access to nutritious diets. All the households used two or more environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. However, the use of multiple environmentally sustainable practices did not correlate with improved food security. This latter result may be due to the limited knowledge of the farmers about trade-offs between various climate change adaptation measures. The findings suggest the need to refocus research from the question of whether small family farmers are willing to adopt (or not) climate change adaptation practices to identifying those practices that are capable of balancing economic, social, and environmental goals in a specific context.","output":"Exploring climate change adaptation practices and household food security in the Middle Eastern context: a case of small family farms in Central Bekaa, Lebanon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Seronegative Limbic encephalitis (SNLE) is a rare condition that presents with cognitive impairment, personality changes, memory loss, and seizures. It results from either an idiopathic or neoplasm mediated autoimmune processes leading to direct neuronal damage. We present a rare case of SNLE that significantly improved after early recognition and aggressive plasma exchange therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman with history of systemic lupus erythematosus, CKD, hypertension, presented with 14 day history of new-onset progressively worsening behavioral changes manifested by irritability, psychosis, confusion, delirium and elevated blood pressures ranging from 200-250 mm Hg. On admission, patient was extremely delirious and was intubated for airway protection. Workup showed Hb 9.8, BUN 62, Cr 3.15, and ESR >145. CT head was negative for abnormalities and MRI brain showed small vessel disease with old microhemorrhages but no acute pathology. Patient was started on antibiotics and acyclovir for suspicion of central nervous system infection, hypertension was managed with intravenous nicardipine. CSF revealed mildly elevated total protein of 59 mg/dL and white cell count of 3, otherwise normal. Blood cultures, CSF cultures, HSV I/II, West Nile, COVID-19 and prolonged video EEG remained unremarkable. Lupus cerebritis was ruled out by rheumatology given stable levels of C3/C4. Patient developed generalized hyperekplexia with repetitive clonus-like movements of all extremities that resolved spontaneously shortly after discontinuation of the external stimuli. Given her the clinical presentation, hyperekplexia on exam and negative work-up, limbic encephalitis was suspected. She was started on IV steroids and plasma exchange therapy with significant improvement in mental status. Paraneoplastic panel came negative. A CT scan of abdomen/pelvis showed an adrenal mass, however PET was negative for avid malignancy and adrenal gland was hypometabolic. She was discharged with complete neurologic recovery. DISCUSSION: SNLE comprises 10% of all autoimmune encephalitis diagnoses. In our patient due to reports of a previous adrenal mass, initial suspicion was of SNLE secondary to adrenal source was made but after extensive workup the diagnosis of exclusion of autoimmune SNLE was made. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange remain understudied in SNLE yet data suggests at least 50% of patients recover with these interventions. Due to concern of persistent autoimmune injury if SNLE is left untreated/undiagnosed, prompt empiric intervention and simultaneous workup to rule out an underlying occult malignancy may stagnate neurological impairment. CONCLUSIONS: We highly recommend keeping SNLE in the differential of ICU patients with persistent encephalopathy, especially in those with a history of autoimmune disorders.

These measures will remain crucial during the rollout of newly developed vaccines to limit community-based spread of COVID-19 and prevent healthcare systems from becoming overburdened. Therefore, it is essential to understand the determinants of public adherence to physical distancing measures to inform current and future public health communications. Methods: As part of the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation (iCARE) study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate behavioural responses to physical distancing measures in Ireland. A nationally representative sample of 1000 adults completed the survey over one week in June 2020 during Phase 2 restrictions. Participants completed measures assessing socio-demographic characteristics, theory-based psychological predictors, and physical distancing behaviours. Results: Awareness of restrictions in place at the time of data collection was high overall, as was adherence to most physical distancing measures. Participants aged 25C34 years reported the poorest adherence to maintaining a 2-metre distance from others (71.2%, versus 79C90% for all other age groups), avoiding social gatherings (42.4%, versus 52C62%) and avoiding non-essential travel (63.9%, versus 69C79%). Females were slightly more adherent than were males to most measures. Adherence also varied according to participant beliefs and COVID-19 risk category. Conclusions: These results indicate that adherence to physical distancing guidelines varies depending on the behaviour in question as well as socio-demographic and psychological factors. Although some non-adherence was evident for all physical distancing behaviours, adherence was generally high. Future interventions to improve adherence to physical distancing measures should target individual-level determinants of adherence in tandem with effective public health interventions.","output":"Adherence to physical distancing guidance in Ireland: a nationally representative analysis from the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation (iCARE) study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether burnout, anxiety, and depression constitute the same or different constructs. Better understanding of these constructs is important for diagnosis and treatment for intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations and distinctiveness of burnout, depression, and anxiety in a sample of ICU clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the ICU Visits Study, a cluster-randomized crossover clinical trial conducted from April 2017 to July 2018 in 36 mixed public and private nonprofit ICUs in Brazil. ICU clinicians, including day-shift physicians, nurses, nurse technicians, and physiotherapists working in an ICU at least 20 hours per week, were enrolled. Data were analyzed from December 27, 2019, to October 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome measures were burnout, depression, and anxiety measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; range, 0-6, with high scores indicating more burnout) and the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS; range, 0-3, with higher scores indicating more depression or anxiety). Internal consistencies were satisfactory. RESULTS: The total sample included 715 ICU clinicians (median [interquartile range] age, 34.8 [30.2-39.3] years; 520 [72.7%] women), including 96 physicians (13.4%), 159 nurses (22.2%), 358 nurse technicians (50.1%), and 102 physiotherapists (14.3%). Clinicians reported low levels of emotional exhaustion (mean [SD] score, 1.84 [1.18]), depersonalization (mean [SD] score, 0.98 [1.03]), and personal accomplishment (mean [SD] score, 5.05 [0.87]) on the MBI, and similarly low levels of depression (mean [SD] score, 0.54 [0.40]) and anxiety (mean [SD] score, 0.70 [0.45]) on the HADS. Confirmatory factor analyses consistently showed improved fit separating latent burnout dimensions from depression and anxiety. An exploratory graph analysis combining gaussian graphical model with clustering algorithms for weighted networks suggested 3 clusters, with distinct burnout, anxiety, and depression clusters. This structure was confirmed using a bootstrap with 1000 random samples, in which the 3-cluster solution emerged in 625 samples (62.5%). Both latent variable loadings and network statistics suggested 3 key indicators (ie, feeling burned out from work, worrying thoughts, and reverse-scored reporting feeling cheerful) that can be used for short screening instruments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that burnout and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety were empirically distinct in a large sample of ICU clinicians, highlighting the importance of screening for burnout and clinical symptoms to allow fast access to adequate support and treatment in health professionals at high risk of burnout.","output":"Association of Burnout With Depression and Anxiety in Critical Care Clinicians in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The relationship between the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 vaccination among U.S. child care providers remains unknown. If unvaccinated child care providers are also less likely to employ nonpharmaceutical interventions, then a vaccine mandate across child care programs may have larger health and safety benefits. Methods To assess and quantify the relationship between the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 vaccination among U.S. child care providers, we conducted a prospective cohort study of child care providers (N = 20,013) from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Child care providers were asked to complete a self-administered email survey in May-June 2020 assessing the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (predictors) and a follow-up survey in May-June 2021 assessing COVID-19 vaccination (outcome). Nonpharmaceutical interventions were dichotomized as personal mitigation measures (e.g., masking, social distancing, handwashing) and classroom mitigation measures (e.g., temperature checks of staff/children, symptom screening for staff/children, cohorting). Results For each unendorsed personal mitigation measure during 2020, the likelihood of vaccination in 2021 decreased by 7% (Risk Ratio = 0.93 [95% 0.93 C 0.95]). No significant association was found between classroom mitigation measures and child care provider vaccination (Risk Ratio = 1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.01]). Conclusions Child care providers who used less personal mitigation measures were also less likely to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as an alternative form of protection. The combined nonadherence to multiple types of preventative health behaviors, that is, both nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination, among some child care providers may support a role for mandatory vaccination to achieve pandemic control.","output":"Relationship Between the Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions and COVID-19 Vaccination Among U.S. Child Care Providers: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the results of a simulation study of the spread of pandemic influenza, the effects of public health measures on the simulated pandemic, and the resultant adequacy of the surge capacity of the hospital infrastructure and to investigate the adequacy of key elements of the national pandemic influenza plan to reduce the overall attack rate so that surge capacity would not be overwhelmed. DESIGN We used 2 discrete-event simulation models: the first model simulates the contact and disease transmission process, as affected by public health interventions, to produce a stream of arriving patients, and the second model simulates the diagnosis and treatment process and determines patient outcomes. SETTING Hypothetical scenarios were based on the response plans, infrastructure, and demographic data of the population of San Antonio, Texas. RESULTS Use of a mix of strategies, including social distancing, antiviral medications, and targeted vaccination, may limit the overall attack rate so that demand for care would not exceed the capacity of the infrastructure. Additional simulations to assess social distancing as a sole mitigation strategy suggest that a reduction of infectious community contacts to half of normal levels would have to occur within approximately 7 days.

METHODS: We examined the association between dexamethasone use and mortality at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex and comorbidity) and clinical and biological markers of clinical severity of COVID-19, and stratified by the need for respiratory support, i.e. mechanical ventilation or oxygen. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 12 217 adult patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, 171 (1.4%) received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point occurred in 10/63 (15.9%) patients who received dexamethasone and 298/1129 (26.4%) patients who did not.

Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-8, and IL-6, play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS by stimulating chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. To obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated ALI, we compared SARS-CoV infections in two different nonhuman primate species, cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. Viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in SARS-CoV-infected macaques and African green monkeys. Inflammatory cytokines that play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS or have neutrophil chemoattractant activity, such as IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, were, however, induced only in macaques. In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including osteopontin and CCL3, were upregulated in the lungs of African green monkeys to a significantly greater extent than in macaques. Because African green monkeys developed more severe ALI than macaques, with hyaline membrane formation, some of these differentially expressed proinflammatory genes may be critically involved in development of the observed pathological changes. Induction of distinct proinflammatory genes after SARS-CoV infection in different nonhuman primate species needs to be taken into account when analyzing outcomes of intervention strategies in these species.","output":"Distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-induced acute lung injury pathways in two different nonhuman primate species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and it continues to threaten public health.

In the subgroup of allergic patients with RRTI, the number of allergic episodes (AE) and the use of anti-allergic drugs were also evaluated. One hundred and sixty patients, 79 allocated to the treated group (TG) and 81 to the placebo group (PG), were enrolled; 30 were lost during the study and 120 (79 females and 38 males) were evaluated. The PG had 1.43 episodes in the 8-months of follow-up while the TG had 0.86 episodes (p =0.036). A similar result was observed in the allergic patients (1.80 and 0.86 episodes for the PG and the TG, respectively, p =0.047). The use of antibiotics was reduced (mean 1.24 and 2.83 days of treatment for the TG and the PG). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the estimated risk of needing antibiotics and NSAIDs was reduced by 52.1 and 30.6%, respectively. With regard to the number of AE, no significant difference was observed between the two groups, but bronchodilators, antihistamines and local corticosteroids were reduced by 25.7%, 56.2% and 41.6%, respectively, in the TG. Lantigen B significantly reduced the number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. This finding suggests a first line use of this drug for the prophylaxis of infectious episodes in these patients.","output":"The bacterial lysate Lantigen B reduces the number of acute episodes in patients with recurrent infections of the respiratory tract: The results of a double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disorder caused by inactivation of ADAMTS13. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies have produced conflicting data regarding seasonal association of TTP diagnoses. This study evaluated the seasonal distribution of acute TTP in southern Louisiana. Additionally, this study timeline overlapped with the initiation of a new screening protocol for ADAMTS13 testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients receiving ADAMTS13 testing at Ochsner Medical Center from January 2010 to December 2017 was performed. TTP patient episodes were defined by ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Episodes were plotted according to season of presentation and a chi-square analysis was performed. Data of identified TTP patients was analyzed to evaluate for confounding variables. ADAMTS13 order volumes and results before and after screening protocol implementation were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two ADAMTS13 tests were ordered on 245 unique patients. Twenty-five patients had ADAMTS13 activity <10%. No significant differences in seasonal TTP case distribution were identified. Patients with confirmed TTP were younger and more likely to be Black or African American. A screening protocol did not decrease the number of annual ADAMTS13 test orders in our time frame, but was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of positive results. CONCLUSION: No significant seasonal distribution of TTP was identified in our population. This analysis provides previously unexamined regional information regarding this diagnosis. The number of tests ordered after the implementation of the screening protocol increased, corresponding with our facility's expanding reach.","output":"Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in Louisiana: Seasonal distribution and evaluation of an ADAMTS13 order screening protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID-19 related deaths. Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID-19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought. Further, the severity of COVID-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SAR-CoV-2 infection. The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels. Expression of several key inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long non-coding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses. Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factors-induced inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19.","output":"Epigenetic underpinnings of inflammation: Connecting the dots between pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, time-consuming and may result in false-negative results. Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies. AREAS COVERED: The main methodologies of serology-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on 31th December 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two weeks post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen.

Almost sixty percent of the pathogens that have emerged in humans during the last 30C40years are of animal origin and about sixty percent of them show an important variety of host species besides humans (3 or more possible host species). In this review, we focus on zoonotic infections with vector-borne transmission and dissect the contrasting effects that a multiplicity of host reservoirs and vectors can have on their disease dynamics. We discuss the effects exerted by host and vector species richness and composition on pathogen prevalence (i.e., reduction, including the dilution effect, or amplification). We emphasize that, in multiple host systems and for vector-borne zoonotic pathogens, host reservoir species and vector species can exert contrasting effect locally. The outcome on disease dynamics (reduced pathogen prevalence in vectors when the host reservoir species is rich and increased pathogen prevalence when the vector species richness increases) may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time. We then ask briefly how a shift towards a more systemic perspective in the study of emerging infectious diseases, which are driven by a multiplicity of hosts, may stimulate further research developments. Finally, we propose some research avenues that take better into account the multi-host species reality in the transmission of the most important emerging infectious diseases, and, particularly, suggest, as a possible orientation, the careful assessment of the life-history characteristics of hosts and vectors in a community ecology-based perspective.","output":"Ecosystem dynamics, biological diversity and emerging infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this review is to discuss the implications of COVID-19 on various aspects of dental care. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had suspended dental practice globally for over 3 months. While dental practice is being resumed cautiously, standard infection control protocols that were traditionally overlooked are now being strictly implemented. Post-COVID-19, dental care is expected to see a drastic change in the way it is practiced. REVIEW RESULTS: With a view on the natural history and disease dynamics of COVID-19, this review reports various aspects of dental care, viz., patient triaging, engineering and work practice controls, and administrative, financial, and ethical aspects of dental care during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Current evidence-based recommendations with regard to infection-control practices are discussed. A call for universal oral health care with suggestions regarding integration of medical and health care is also proposed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is expected to be a watershed moment in the field of dentistry. While we expect to see positive changes in safe delivery of dental care, an increase in cost of availing care is imminent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The practice of dentistry and dental infection control has undergone dimensional changes due to bloodborne infectious diseases such as hepatitis B virus infections and human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Due to these pandemics, many regulatory organizations have provided safety recommendations and guidelines that impact the dental practice. Currently, we are faced with a highly infective disease with a high mortality rate among people with comorbidities and of predominantly droplet transmission and no concrete safety recommendations and guidelines.

Although replication defective in normal cells, 28kbp of adenovirus genes are delivered to the cell nucleus alongside the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein gene. Methods: : We used direct RNA sequencing to analyse transcript expression from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 genome in human MRC-5 and A549 cell lines that are non-permissive for vector replication alongside the replication permissive cell line, HEK293. In addition, we used quantitative proteomics to study over time the proteome and phosphoproteome of A549 and MRC5 cells infected with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine candidate. Results: : The expected SARS-CoV-2 S coding transcript dominated in all cell lines. We also detected rare S transcripts with aberrant splice patterns or polyadenylation site usage. Adenovirus vector transcripts were almost absent in MRC-5 cells but in A549 cells there was a broader repertoire of adenoviral gene expression at very low levels. Proteomically, in addition to S glycoprotein, we detected multiple adenovirus proteins in A549 cells compared to just one in MRC5 cells. Conclusions: : Overall the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines transcriptomic and proteomic repertoire is as expected. The combined transcriptomic and proteomics approaches provide an unparalleled insight into the behaviour of this important class of vaccine candidate and illustrate the potential of this technique to inform future viral vaccine vector design.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 infection of human cell lines reveals a normal low range of viral backbone gene expression alongside very high levels of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to endocrinologists, primary care clinicians, health care professionals, and other stakeholders. METHODS: The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology conducted literature searches for relevant articles published from January 1, 2010, to November 15, 2021. A task force of medical experts developed evidence-based guideline recommendations based on a review of clinical evidence, expertise, and informal consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development. RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY: This guideline includes 34 evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of persons with NAFLD and/or NASH and contains 385 citations that inform the evidence base. CONCLUSION: NAFLD is a major public health problem that will only worsen in the future, as it is closely linked to the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given this link, endocrinologists and primary care physicians are in an ideal position to identify persons at risk on to prevent the development of cirrhosis and comorbidities. While no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications to treat NAFLD are currently available, management can include lifestyle changes that promote an energy deficit leading to weight loss; consideration of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; and bariatric surgery, for persons who have obesity, as well as some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH. Management should also promote cardiometabolic health and reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with this complex disease.","output":"American Association of Clinical Endocrinology Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Primary Care and Endocrinology Clinical Settings: Co-Sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill children. However, the common lack of baseline serum creatinine values affects AKI diagnosis and staging. Several approaches for estimating baseline creatinine values in those patients were evaluated. Methods This single-center retrospective study enrolled pediatric patients with documented serum creatinine measurements within 3 months before admission and more than two serum creatinine measurements within 7 days after admission to the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care children's hospital between January 2016 and April 2020. Four different approaches for estimating AKI using serum creatinine measurements were compared: 1) back-calculation using age-adjusted normal reference glomerular filtration rates, 2) age-adjusted normal reference serum creatinine values, 3) minimum values measured within 7 days after admission, and 4) initial values upon admission. Results The approach using minimum values showed the best agreement with the measured baseline value, with the largest intraclass correlation coefficient (0.623), smallest bias (-0.04), and narrowest limit of agreement interval (1.032). For AKI diagnosis and staging, the minimum values were 80.8% and 76.1% accurate, respectively. The other estimated baseline values underestimated AKI and showed poor agreement with baseline values before admission, with a misclassification rate of up to 42% (p < 0.001). Conclusion Minimum values of serum creatinine measured within 7 days after hospital admission showed the best agreement with creatinine measured within 3 months before admission, indicating the possibility of using it as a baseline when baseline data are unavailable.

METHODS Patients with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy with curative intent in three Korean tertiary hospitals between January 2003 and December 2010 were included in this multicentre, retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association between operation method and survival. RESULTS A total of 753 patients with early gastric cancer were included in the study. There were no significant differences in the matched cohort for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) for laparoscopy-assisted versus open total gastrectomy 0.96, 95 per cent c.i. 0.57 to 1.65) or recurrence-free survival (HR 2.20, 0.51 to 9.52). The patterns of recurrence were no different between the two groups. The severity of complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, was similar in both groups. The most common complications were anastomosis-related in the laparoscopy-assisted group (8.0 per cent versus 4.2 per cent in the open group; P = 0.015) and wound-related in the open group (1.6 versus 5.6 per cent respectively; P = 0.003).

Resident billing performance can have significant financial implications for the academic institutions employing them. During their residency training, dermatology residents commonly find themselves responsible for the billing of patient encounters. However, despite the importance of adequate knowledge and skill in medical coding, recent data show inadequacies in this aspect of resident education. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of an interventional coding curriculum on dermatology residents billing accuracy at our institution. Methodology Billing data, including evaluation and management (E/M) level of service, procedural codes, and current procedural terminology modifiers (if applicable) were queried from the electronic medical records (EMR) at a resident clinic seeing patients on three half-days each week. Billing codes were gathered from patient visits occurring in two separate time periods, before and after the intervention. The intervention consisted of monthly resident lectures on E/M and procedural billing in outpatient dermatology with associated quizzes. Billing accuracy was verified by three attending dermatologists through chart review and compared between the two time periods. Results Overall, billing data from 532 patient visits, 267 from the pre-intervention period and 265 from the post-intervention period, were checked for accuracy. The accuracy of resident-billed E/M levels of service was similar between the pre- and post-intervention periods (44.3% vs. 44.8%). Similar rates of undercoding and overcoding were noted between the pre- and post-intervention periods (35.2% undercoded and 8% overcoded vs. 35.7% and 8.9%, respectively). However, substantial improvements were noted in the rate of errors with procedural codes and modifiers in the post-intervention period. Overall, 21.9% of procedural codes were incorrectly billed pre-intervention compared to 3.7% post-intervention (p < 0.05). Moreover, 55.2% of modifiers were incorrectly billed pre-intervention versus 27.3% post-intervention (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our analysis suggests that billing lectures yielded a clear improvement in resident billing accuracy at our institution. While there was no improvement in E/M coding, there was a significant improvement in the usage of procedural codes and modifiers. Similar analyses can be used by other residency programs to monitor resident billing performance and the efficacy of educational programs on medical billing.","output":"Impact of Coding Curriculum on Dermatology Resident Billing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Self-medication is becoming common during the coronavirus disease ?2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the increasing popularity of home-based management of asymptomatic and mild cases. In this case report, we describe a patient who developed manic symptoms as a result of self-medication with a regimen containing cannabis to manage COVID-19 symptoms. CASE DETAILS: A 52-year-old man with no prior history of a mental disorder, presented with a one-week history of talking more than usual, poor sleep, destructiveness, irritability, and altered mental status, following use of homemade remedies containing oranges, garlic, ginger, onions, honey, lemon, and cannabis to treat COVID-19 related symptoms over a 2-week period. This was his index presentation with such symptoms in his life. He had never used any substance of addiction before, did not have any known chronic medical condition, and had no family member with a history of any known mental illness. He was a suspect because his father had tested positive for COVID-19 and was undergoing treatment. He tested negative for COVID-19 after 3-weeks of initial COVID-19 like symptoms, urine sample was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and he had normal investigations. He was managed with a mood stabilizer (oral carbamazepine at a dose of 200mg three times daily), antipsychotic (chlorpromazine 200mg twice daily), a sedative (diazepam 10mg at before bedtime), and occupational therapy.

This would apply to dental students as well. Thus, it is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination rates in this group. Further, as healthcare providers, they are entrusted with providing health recommendations and advocating for their patients, community, and profession, including vaccinations. METHODS: Using ualtricsXM an online platform, in 2020, a survey was administered anonymously to dental students at three dental schools to assess the attitudes of dental students to the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine and likelihood of recommending and giving the vaccination to patients were assessed. RESULTS: Nearly, all participants had positive attitudes toward vaccines in general, agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19, and personally knew someone who had COVID-19; however, only 56% are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as an FDA-approved vaccine was available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine, 63% reported they would take it if mandated by the health systems/dental school; however, 16.3% of the overall respondents would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if mandated. Several factors are associated with vaccine acceptance and the likelihood of recommending the vaccination, such as trusting public health experts, concerns about side effects, and agreeing with vaccine mandates.

Since its emergence, a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been reported, and the variants that show high infectivity are classified as the variants of concern according to the US CDC. In this study, we performed both all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations and microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments to characterize the binding interactions between ACE2 and RBD of all current variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) and two variants of interest (Epsilon and Kappa). We report that the RBD of the Alpha (N501Y) variant requires the highest amount of force initially to be detached from ACE2 due to the N501Y mutation in addition to the role of N90-glycan, followed by Beta/Gamma (K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y) or Delta (L452R and T478K) variant. Among all variants investigated in this work, the RBD of the Epsilon (L452R) variant is relatively easily detached from ACE2.

A test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms. Alternatively, due to the limited availability of testing, many sites employ a symptom-based strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus. OBJECTIVES: To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution strategies. STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical center.

The primary aim of this investigation was to expand the MOAA/S score to include truly noxious stimulation, thereby extending the dynamic range of the assessment to include sedation states consistent with deeper levels of general anaesthesia. METHODS Twenty healthy volunteers received target controlled infusions of fentanyl (target=0.8 ng ml(-1)) and propofol (starting at 0.5 g ml(-1) and gradually increasing to 5 g ml(-1)). At each propofol concentration, a MOAA/S score was obtained before and after tetanic electrical stimulation. The tetanic electrical stimulation current was gradually increased until the subject responded or until 50 mA was delivered without a response. A pharmacodynamic model was constructed to characterize the concentration-effect relationship between propofol and the MOAA/S scores. RESULTS All subjects required a significantly higher propofol concentration to produce unresponsiveness to tetanic electrical stimulation at 50 mA compared with a standardized trapezius squeeze. The pharmacodynamic model adequately characterized the concentration-effect relationship. CONCLUSIONS The Extended Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (or EOAA/S) extends the range of the widely used MOAA/S score to include truly noxious stimulation, thereby enabling the identification of drug-induced central nervous system depression representative of surgical anaesthesia.","output":"Enhancing a sedation score to include truly noxious stimulation: the Extended Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (EOAA/S)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Epilogue reflects on various interpretations and aspects of justice interwoven in the contributions to this book.

We analysed four years (2012C2015) of daily bovine transports to assess the risk of disease transmission and identify times and locations where monitoring would be most effective. Specifically, we investigated how the seasonal dynamics of transport networks, driven by the alpine summering and traditional cattle markets, affect the risk of epidemic outbreaks. RESULTS: We found strong and consistent seasonal variation in several structural network measures as well as in measures for outbreak risk. Analysis of the consequences of excluding markets, dealers and alpine pastures from the network shows that markets contribute much more to the overall outbreak risk than alpine summering. Static descriptors of monthly transport networks were poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; a dynamic measure, which takes the temporal structure of the network into account, gave better risk estimates. A stochastic simulation suggests that targeted surveillance based on this dynamic network allows a higher detection rate and smaller outbreak size at detection than compared to other sampling schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic measures based on time-stamped datathe outgoing contact chaincan give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes. Using this measure we find evidence that even in a country with intense summering practice, markets continue being the prime risk factor for the spread of contagious diseases.","output":"Dynamic network measures reveal the impact of cattle markets and alpine summering on the risk of epidemic outbreaks in the Swiss cattle population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aims to evaluate food waste and menu quality in two canteens (A and B) from a Portuguese public university in order to identify challenges and opportunities to improve the food service.

Unfortunately, however, unlike for the higher senses of vision and hearing, there is currently nothing that can be done to bring back the chemical senses once they are lost (or have started their inevitable decline). The evidence suggests that such chemosensory changes can result in a range of maladaptive food behaviours, including the addition of more salt and sugar to food and drink in order to experience the same taste intensity while, at the same time, reducing their overall consumption because food has lost its savour. Here, though, it is also important to stress the importance of the more social aspects of eating and drinking, given the evidence suggesting that a growing number of older individuals are consuming more of their meals alone than ever before. Various solutions have been put forward in order to try to enhance the food experience amongst the elderly, including everything from optimising the product-intrinsic food inputs provided to the remaining functional senses through to a variety of digital interventions.

Data were obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set (CMBD in Spanish). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A total of 962 patients were recorded; 665 were men. The mean age (SD) was 5518.8 years. The annual incidence rate increased from 0.74 to 1.24 cases per million person-years. The lethality rate was 31.3%. Renal failure (41.6%) and hematological malignancy (36.3%) were the main factors involved. CONCLUSIONS Mucormycosis is a rare infectious disease in Spain, but it has had a significantly increased incidence in the last two decades. Being an adult male and having diabetes, neoplasm or renal failure are the main factors associated. High mortality is usually associated mainly with hematological malignancy and renal failure.

Participants 1,110 and 796 patients with either COVID-19 or healthy CT volumes from Moscow, Russia, and China, respectively. Main outcome measures We developed a deep learning model with a novel mixed-effects layer to model the relationship between slices in CT imaging. The model was trained on a dataset from hospitals in Moscow, Russia, and externally geographically validated on a dataset from a consortium of Chinese hospitals. Model performance was evaluated in discriminative performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, calibration performance was assessed using calibration curves, and clinical benefit was assessed using decision curve analysis. Finally, the model's decisions were assessed visually using saliency maps. Results External validation on the large Chinese dataset showed excellent performance with an AUROC of 0.956 (95% CI: 0.943, 0.970), with a sensitivity and specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.879 (0.852, 0.906), 0.942 (0.913, 0.972), 0.988 (0.975, 1.00), and 0.732 (0.650, 0.814).

Specifically, the roles of c-di-AMP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis immunity and virulence have been largely explored, although its contribution to the safety and efficacy of live tuberculosis vaccines is less understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the synthesis of c-di-AMP is negatively regulated by the M. tuberculosis PhoPR virulence system. Accordingly, the live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine candidate M. tuberculosis vaccine (MTBVAC), based on double phoP and fadD26 deletions, produces more than 25- and 45-fold c-di-AMP levels relative to wild-type M. tuberculosis or the current vaccine bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG), respectively. Secretion of this second messenger was exclusively detected in MTBVAC but not in M. tuberculosis or in BCG. We also demonstrate that c-di-AMP synthesis during in vitro cultivation of M. tuberculosis is a growth-phase- and medium-dependent phenotype. To uncover the role of this metabolite in the vaccine properties of MTBVAC, we constructed and validated knockout and overproducing/oversecreting derivatives by inactivating the disA or cnpB gene, respectively. All MTBVAC derivatives elicited superior interleukin-1 (IL-1) responses compared with BCG during an in vitro infection of human macrophages. However, both vaccines failed to elicit interferon  (IFN) activation in this cellular model. We found that increasing c-di-AMP levels remarkably correlated with a safer profile of tuberculosis vaccines in the immunodeficient mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that overproduction of c-di-AMP due to cnpB inactivation resulted in lower protection of MTBVAC, while the absence of c-di-AMP in the MTBVAC disA derivative maintains the protective efficacy of this vaccine in mice.","output":"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PhoPR virulence system regulates expression of the universal second messenger c-di-AMP and impacts vaccine safety and efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Outpatient clinics were shifted rapidly to telehealth in Australia during the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, drastically altering patient care and experience.

Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen having intracytoplasmic inclusions.

METHODS: Twenty two PwMS treated at the Clinic of Neurology, in Belgrade, who developed COVID-19 and/or were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, during treatment with cladribine and alemtuzumab, were included. Out of 18 patients treated with cladribine, 11 developed COVID-19, and 11 were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (four with mRNA vaccine, 7 with Sinopharm). Four MS patients under alemtuzumab were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; three with mRNA, and one with Sinopharm vaccine. SARS-Cov-2 IgG response was measured using ELISA anti-spike protein-based serology (INEP, Belgrade, Serbia). RESULTS: All 7 patients under cladribine treatment who suffered from COVID-19, developed IgG antibodies, 2.0-5.5 months after last symptoms. All four (100%) patients under cladribine who were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and three out of seven (42.9%) vaccinated with Sinopharm, developed antibodies. All 4 patients under alemtuzumab developed antibodies after vaccination. In all cases, seroprotection occurred, irrespective of timing of vaccination and absolute lymphocyte count. CONCLUSION: Our findings in a small number of highly active PwMS in whom, lymphodepleting, immune reconstitution therapies, were applied in order to successfully manage MS, indicate that in a number of these patients it was possible to develop at the same time seroprotection in these patients after COVID-19 vaccination in these complex circumstances.","output":"HUMORAL RESPONSE TO SARS-CoV-2 AND COVID-19 VACCINES IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TREATED WITH IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION THERAPIES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syncytin is an envelope protein of the human endogenous retrovirus family W (HERV-W). Syncytin is specifically expressed in the human placenta and mediates trophoblast cell fusion into the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer. It is a polypeptide of 538 amino acids and is predicted to be posttranslationally cleaved into a surface (SU) subunit and a transmembrane (TM) subunit. Functional characterization of syncytin protein can aid understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying syncytin-mediated cell fusion. In this report, we studied the structure-function relationship of syncytin in 293T and HeLa cells transiently expressing wild-type syncytin or syncytin mutants generated by linker scanning and deletion mutagenesis. Of the 22 linker-inserted mutants, mutants InS51, InV139, InE156, InS493, InA506, and InL529 were fusogenic, suggesting that regions around amino acids S51, V139, and E156 in the SU subunit and S493, A506, and L529 in the cytoplasmic domain (CTM) of syncytin are flexible in conformation. Of the 17 deletion mutants, nine mutants with deletions in the region from amino acids 479 to 538 were fusogenic. The deletion mutant DelI480, containing only the first four amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain, had enhanced fusogenic activity in comparison with the wild-type. In addition, two heptad repeat regions (HRA and B) were defined in the TM subunit of syncytin. A peptide inhibitor derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat region (HRB) was shown to potently inhibit syncytin-mediated cell fusion. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of syncytin is not essential for syncytin-mediated fusion but may play a regulatory role, and an intramolecular interaction between HRA and B is involved in the fusion process.","output":"Functional characterization of the placental fusogenic membrane protein syncytin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Liberia has a severe shortage in the health workforce, which is amplified in rural areas. Many talented Liberians leave the country for post-graduate education; those physicians who do stay are concentrated in Monrovia. OBJECTIVE: We initiated a family medicine specialty training program (FMSTP) to increase the number of well-trained physicians who have the knowledge, skills, and commitment to meet the health needs of the Liberian people. METHODS: The Liberian College of Physicians and Surgeons (LCPS) family medicine program is a three-year post-graduate course that follows the West African College of Physician (WACP) curriculum. The program has a longitudinal rural training component supported by Partners in Health in Maryland county, where residents gain experience in a remote and under-served region. The program is evaluated through resident evaluations and ultimately bench-marked by accreditation and exam pass rates. FINDINGS: The FMSTP commenced in July 2017, and the first rural rotation was in January 2018. To-date 13 residents have completed a total of 43 rotations in Maryland. Residents surveyed highly rated the faculty and their rural rotations. They identify more hands-on involvement in patient care, exposure to community health, and one-on-one time with faculty as the greatest assets of the rural training experience. Accreditation from the WACP was granted in December 2018. One of the graduating residents from the first class in 2020 is now serving as the first Liberian family medicine specialist in Maryland County. DISCUSSION: Investing in a strong rural training component in our FMSTP has not only strengthened the program but has also built the infrastructure to establish our rural site as an attractive teaching hospital for intern doctors and nursing students. As the program continues to grow, success will be measured by the proportion of Liberian medical students entering the family medicine training program, retention of family medicine physicians in rural areas, and ultimately progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).","output":"The Role of Family Medicine Training in Addressing Workforce Challenges in Rural Liberia C Early Implementation Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explain using a structural equation model to patient satisfaction by analysing confidence in preventive measures against COVID-19 as an antecedent of this satisfaction and the effect that these measures have on the antecedents of service quality and perceived value.

The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% and 50% most of the time after February and America contributes around 40% in July 2020. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America and Europe contribute around 90% in December 2020, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America and Europe.

Its role as a tool of communication by the Public Health Departments in the U.S. remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media following of the Public Health Departments of the 50 States of the U.S. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected by visiting the Public Health Department web page for each social media platform. State-level demographics were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention was utilized to collect information regarding the Governance of each States Public Health Department. Health rankings were collected from Americas Health Rankings 2019 Annual report from the United Health Foundation. The U.S. News and World Report Education Rankings were utilized to provide information regarding the public education of each State. EXPOSURE: Data were pulled on 3 separate dates: first on March 5th (baseline and pre-national emergency declaration (NED) for COVID-19), March 18th (week following NED), and March 25th (2 weeks after NED). In addition, a variable identifying the total change across platforms was also created. All data were collected at the State level. MAIN OUTCOME: Overall, the social media following of the state Public Health Departments was very low. There was a significant increase in the public interest in following the Public Health Departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: With the declaration of National Emergency, there was a 150% increase in overall public following of the State Public Health Departments in the U.S. The increase was most noted in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. The overall following in the pandemic hotspots, such as New York, California, and Florida, was significantly lower. Interesting correlations were noted between various demographic variables, health, and education ranking of the States and the social media following of their Health Departments. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Social media following of Public Health Departments across all States of the U.S. was very low. Though, the social media following significantly increased during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it still remains low. Significant opportunity exists for Public Health Departments to improve social media use to engage the public better.","output":"A Panel Evaluation of the Changes in the General Publics Social-Media-Following of United States Public Health Departments during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problem Fieldwork is a vital component of public health emergency response, yet little has been published on undertaking fieldwork safely.

Novel pathogens pose dangers to fieldwork staff, particularly when there are global or local shortages of personal protective equipment. Action During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, New South Wales (NSW) Health's Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) deployed staff for fieldwork in a range of settings. The PHEOC developed a protocol to systematize planning, risk assessment and management for COVID-19 fieldwork. The protocol was accompanied by training, discussion exercises and debriefs to support PHEOC fieldwork staff. Lessons learned Effective fieldwork is an essential component of outbreak investigation and management, including stakeholder management. Here, we share and discuss key elements of the NSW Health protocol to support fieldwork during outbreak responses for emerging communicable diseases across various resource contexts. Limited understanding of novel viruses, particularly in the early phases of a pandemic, must be considered in decisions to deploy fieldwork staff and implement precautionary risk mitigation approaches.

Its impact in rare disease populations is not known, hence we performed a cross-sectional study in a large cohort of Gaucher disease (GD) patients. In GD, defective acid -glucosidase leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we contacted 197 patients. 181 (92%) participated with informed consent. Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and PCR and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic. Adults (n = 150, mean age 50.2 years) and children (n = 31, mean age 8.6 years) were enrolled. The majority of participants were male (98, 54.1%), with the GBA N370S/N370S genotype (110, 60.8%). Most adults were on GD treatment (117, 78%) with 77 (65.8%) on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Forty-five adults reported primary exposure to COVID-19 and 35 adults reported at least one symptom. Of the 18 adults with 3 or more symptoms, 78.6% of those tested were positive. The most common symptoms in these patients were fevers (9, 56%), fatigue (9, 56%), and weakness (8, 50%). Affected patients reported mild to moderate symptoms managed at home and there were no hospitalizations. Of the 54 asymptomatic patients tested, 2 (3.7%) were positive for antibodies. In our pediatric cohort, 1 asymptomatic patient tested positive. In GD adults, male gender, older age, comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease), GBA genotype and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. Treatment with substrate reduction therapy compared to ERT did not impact the probability of testing positive.

We operationalized resilience as Omaha System Status scores of 4 (minimal signs or symptoms) or 5 (no signs or symptoms) as a discrete strengths measure for each of 42 Omaha System problem concepts. We used visualization techniques and standard descriptive and inferential statistics for analysis. FINDINGS: It was feasible to examine resilience, operationalized as strengths by problem concept, within existing Omaha System or Simplified Omaha System Terms (MSMH) data. We identified several patterns indicating strengths and resilience that were consistent with literature related to community connectedness for community participants, and sleep for individuals in the clinical data.

However, the meteorological parameters linked to influenza occurrence in semi-arid areas are not studied in detail. This study aimed to clarify the impact of meteorological parameters on influenza incidence during 2010C2019 in Lanzhou. The results are expected to facilitate the optimization of influenza-related public health policies by the local healthcare departments. METHODS: Descriptive data related to influenza incidence and meteorology during 2010C2019 in Lanzhou were analyzed. The exposure-response relationship between the risk of influenza occurrence and meteorological parameters was explored according to the distributed lag no-linear model (DLNM) with Poisson distribution. The response surface model and stratified model were used to estimate the interactive effect between relative humidity (RH) and other meteorological parameters on influenza incidence. RESULTS: A total of 6701 cases of influenza were reported during 2010C2019. DLNM results showed that the risk of influenza would gradually increase as the weekly mean average ambient temperature (AT), RH, and absolute humidity (AH) decrease at lag 3 weeks when they were lower than 12.16C, 51.38%, and 5.24 g/m(3), respectively. The low Tem (at 5th percentile, P(5)) had the greatest effect on influenza incidence; the greatest estimated relative risk (RR) was 4.54 (95%CI: 3.19C6.46) at cumulative lag 2 weeks. The largest estimates of RRs for low RH (P(5)) and AH (P(5)) were 4.81 (95%CI: 3.82C6.05) and 4.17 (95%CI: 3.30C5.28) at cumulative lag 3 weeks, respectively. An increase in AT by 1C led to an estimates of percent change (95%CI) of 3.12% (?4.75% to ?1.46%) decrease in the weekly influenza case counts in a low RH environment. In addition, RH showed significant interaction with AT and AP on influenza incidence but not with wind speed. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that low AT, low humidity (RH and AH), and high air pressure (AP) increased the risk of influenza. Moreover, the interactive effect of low RH with low AT and high AP can aggravate the incidence of influenza.","output":"Effects and Interaction of Meteorological Parameters on Influenza Incidence During 2010C2019 in Lanzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although patient rights are an important issue, this remains an understudied research area.

We simulate the propagation of the COVID-19 epidemic in both cities to analyze spreading patterns in urban networks across various activity types. Investigating the impact of the transit network, we find that its removal dampens disease propagation significantly, suggesting that transit restriction is more critical for mitigating post-peak disease spreading in transit dense cities. In the latter stages of disease spread, we find that the greatest share of infections occur at work locations. A statistical analysis of the resulting activity-based contact networks indicates that transit contacts are scale-free, work contacts are Weibull distributed, and shopping or leisure contacts are exponentially distributed. We validate our simulation results against existing case and mortality data across multiple cities in their respective typologies. Our framework demonstrates the potential for tracking epidemic propagation in urban networks, analyzing socio-demographic impacts and assessing activity- and mobility-specific implications of both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention strategies.","output":"Activity-based epidemic propagation and contact network scaling in auto-dependent metropolitan areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemiological pattern of hepatitis A infection has shown dynamic changes in many parts of the world due to improved socio-economic conditions and the accumulation of seronegative subjects, which leads to possible outbreaks and increased morbidity rate. In Tunisia, the epidemiological status of hepatits A virus is currently unknown. However, over the past years higher numbers of symptomatic hepatitis A virus infection in school attendants and several outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health, especially from regions with the lowest socio-economic levels in the country. The aim of this study was to investigate the current seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus antibodies in central-west Tunisia and assess the impact of hepatitis A virus vaccination on hepatitis A epidemiology. METHODS: Serum samples from 1379 individuals, aged 5C75 years, were screened for hepatitis A virus antibodies. Adjusted seroprevalence, incidence and force of infection parameters were estimated by a linear age structured SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. A vaccine model was then constructed to assess the impact on hepatitis A virus epidemiology of 3 scenarios of vaccination strategies: one dose at 12-months of age, one dose at 6-years and one dose at 12-months and another at 6-years of age during 6 years. RESULTS: A rapid increase in anti-hepatitis A virus seroprevalence was noted during infancy and adolescence: 47% of subjects under 10-years-old are infected; the prevalence increases to 77% at 15-years and reaches 97% in subjects aged 30-years. The force of infection is highest between 10 and 30-years of age and the incidence declines with increasing age. The vaccine model showed that the 3-scenarios lead to a significant reduction of the fraction of susceptibles. The two doses scenario gives the best results. Single-dose vaccination at 6-years of age provides more rapid decrease of disease burden in school-aged children, as compared to single-dose vaccination at 12-months, but keeps with a non-negligible fraction of susceptibles among children < 6-years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the epidemiological switch from high to intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A virus in Tunisia and provides models that may help undertake best decisions in terms of vaccinations strategies.","output":"Hepatitis a virus infection in Central-West Tunisia: an age structured model of transmission and vaccination impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasma concentration of vitamin D(3) metabolite 25\\\\hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) is variable among individuals.

We collated vitamin D(3) and 25(OH)D(3) plasma PK data from reported clinical trials and developed a physiologically\\\\based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to appropriately recapitulate training data. Model predictions were then qualified with 25(OH)D(3) plasma PKs under vitamin D(3) and 25(OH)D(3) dose regimens distinct from training data.

HEV is a positive-sense RNA virus expressing three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the ORF1 nonCstructural polyprotein, the viral replicase which transcribes the full-length genome and a subgenomic RNA that encodes the structural ORF2 and ORF3 proteins. The present study is focused on the replication step with the aim to determine whether the ORF1 polyprotein is processed during the HEV lifecycle and to identify where the replication takes place inside the host cell. As no commercial antibody recognizes ORF1 in HEV-replicating cells, we aimed at inserting epitope tags within the ORF1 protein without impacting the virus replication efficacy. Two insertion sites located in the hypervariable region were thus selected to tolerate the V5 epitope while preserving HEV replication efficacy. Once integrated into the infectious full-length Kernow C-1 p6 strain, the V5 epitopes did neither impact the replication of genomic nor the production of subgenomic RNA. Also, the V5-tagged viral particles remained as infectious as the wildtype particles to Huh-7.5 cells. Next, the expression pattern of the V5-tagged ORF1 was compared in heterologous expression and replicative HEV systems. A high molecular weight protein (180 kDa) that was expressed in all three systems and that likely corresponds to the unprocessed form of ORF1 was detected up to 25 days after electroporation in the p6 cell culture system. Additionally, less abundant products of lower molecular weights were detected in both in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Concurrently, the V5-tagged ORF1 was localized by confocal microscopy inside the cell nucleus but also as compact perinuclear substructures in which ORF2 and ORF3 proteins were detected. Importantly, using in situ hybridization (RNAScope (?)), positive and negative-strand HEV RNAs were localized in the perinuclear substructures of HEV-producing cells. Finally, by simultaneous detection of HEV genomic RNAs and viral proteins in these substructures, we identified candidate HEV factories.","output":"Processing and Subcellular Localization of the Hepatitis E Virus Replicase: Identification of Candidate Viral Factories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, began infecting humans in late 2019 and has since spread to over 57 million people and caused over 1.75 million deaths, as of December 27, 2020.

Gaps in the process result in missed opportunities to prevent COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To quantify proportions of cases and their contacts reached by public health authorities and the amount of time needed to reach them and to compare the risk of a positive COVID-19 test result between contacts and the general public during 4-week assessment periods. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study took place at 13 health departments and 1 Indian Health Service Unit in 11 states and 1 tribal nation. Participants included all individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their named contacts. Local COVID-19 surveillance data were used to determine the numbers of persons reported to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were interviewed and named contacts between June and October 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For contacts, the numbers who were identified, notified of their exposure, and agreed to monitoring were calculated. The median time from index case specimen collection to contact notification was calculated, as were numbers of named contacts subsequently notified of their exposure and monitored. The prevalence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test among named and tested contacts was compared with that jurisdictions general population during the same 4 weeks. RESULTS: The total number of cases reported was 74 185. Of these, 43 931 (59%) were interviewed, and 24 705 (33%) named any contacts. Among the 74 839 named contacts, 53 314 (71%) were notified of their exposure, and 34 345 (46%) agreed to monitoring. A mean of 0.7 contacts were reached by telephone by public health authorities, and only 0.5 contacts per case were monitored. In general, health departments reporting large case counts during the assessment (5000) conducted smaller proportions of case interviews and contact notifications. In 9 locations, the median time from specimen collection to contact notification was 6 days or less. In 6 of 8 locations with population comparison data, positive test prevalence was higher among named contacts than the general population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of US local COVID-19 surveillance data, testing named contacts was a high-yield activity for case finding. However, this assessment suggests that contact tracing had suboptimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, largely because 2 of 3 cases were either not reached for interview or named no contacts when interviewed.

The risk of coronary events, such as myocardial infarction, is greater among night shift workers compared to day workers. There is reason to believe that repeated exposure to shift work, especially night shift work, creates alterations in normal circadian patterns of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV) and that these alterations contribute to increased risk of CVD. Recent data suggest that allowing shift workers to nap during night shifts may help to normalize BP and HRV patterns and, over time, reduce the risk of CVD. The risk of CVD related to shift work is elevated for emergency medical services (EMS) shift workers due in part to long-duration shifts, frequent use of night shifts, and a high prevalence of multiple jobs. METHODS: We will use a randomized crossover trial study design with three study conditions. The targeted population is comprised of EMS clinician shift workers, and our goal enrollment is 35 total participants with an estimated 10 of the 35 enrolled not completing the study protocol or classified as lost to attrition. All three conditions will involve continuous monitoring over 72 h and will begin with a 36-h at-home period, followed by 24 total hours in the lab (including a 12-h simulated night shift), ending with 12 h at home. The key difference between the three conditions is the intra-shift nap. Condition 1 will involve a simulated 12-h night shift with total sleep deprivation. Condition 2 will involve a simulated 12-h night shift and a 30-min nap opportunity. Condition 3 will involve a simulated 12-h night shift with a 2-h nap opportunity. Our primary outcomes of interest include blunted BP dipping and reduced HRV as measured by the standard deviation of the inter-beat intervals of normal sinus beats. Non-dipping status will be defined as sleep hours BP dip of less than 10%. DISCUSSION: Our study will address two indicators of cardiovascular health and determine if shorter or longer duration naps during night shifts have a clinically meaningful impact.

Methods: British participants (18-59y) completed a cross-sectional web survey one year (March to April 2021) after the initial lockdown in Britain. Quota-based sampling and weighting resulted in a quasi-representative population sample. We compared Natsal-COVID data with Natsal-3, a household-based probability sample cross-sectional survey (16-74y) conducted in 2010-12. Reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic and uptake of chlamydia testing/HIV testing/cervical cancer screening were analysed among sexually-experienced participants (18-44y) (n=2869, Natsal-COVID; n=8551, Natsal-3). Odds ratios adjusted for age (aOR) and other potential confounders (AOR) describe associations with demographic and behavioural factors. Results: In 2021, 6.9% of women and 16.2% of men reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic. This was more likely among participants: aged 18-24 years, of Black or Black British ethnicity, and reporting same-sex sex (past five years) or one or more new relationships (past year). Chlamydia and HIV testing were more commonly reported by younger participants, those reporting condomless sex with new sexual partners, and men reporting same-sex partners; a very similar distribution to 10 years previously (Natsal-3). However, there were differences during the pandemic, including stronger associations with chlamydia testing for men reporting same-sex partners; with HIV testing for women reporting new sexual partners; and with cervical screening among smokers. Conclusions: Our study suggests differential access to key primary and secondary STI/HIV prevention interventions continued during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the available evidence does not suggest substantial changes in inequalities in since 2010-12. While the pandemic might not have exacerbated inequalities in access to primary and secondary prevention, it is clear that large inequalities persisted, typically among those at greatest STI/HIV risk.","output":"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect access to condoms, chlamydia and HIV testing, and cervical cancer screening at a population level in Britain?

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine if pigs selected for high vs. low FE based on residual feed intake (RFI) respond differently to a dual respiratory and enteric challenge. Pigs selected for low RFI (LRFI, high FE) are considered more FE compared to their high RFI (HRFI, low FE) selected counterparts. Using a 2  2 factorial design, 25 littermate pairs from the HRFI and 25 littermate pairs from the LRFI line (barrows, 50  7 kg BW) were selected, with one pig from each pair assigned to individual pens in either the challenge or the nonchallenge (control) rooms (n = 25 barrows/line/challenge). On days post inoculation (dpi) 0, the challenged pigs were inoculated with LI and Mh (MhLI). Feed intake, BW, fecal swabs, and serum samples were collected and recorded weekly for 42 d. On dpi -2 and 47, 14 littermate pairs (n = 7 barrows/line/challenge) were utilized for initial and final body composition scans using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to calculate longitudinal whole body tissue accretion rates for lean, protein, fat, and bone mineral content. Serum antibody levels and fecal shedding of LI were used to confirm infection. Control pigs remained negative by all measures during the 6-wk trial and MhLI inoculated pigs were confirmed positive via serological antibody responses by dpi 14 for LI and Mh. There were no interactions between RFI line and challenge status for any overall performance parameter (P > 0.05). The 6-wk MhLI challenge resulted in a 17% reduction in ADG, a 12% reduction in ADFI, and a 7% reduction in G:F vs. Controls (P < 0.05). In addition, compared to the Control pigs, MhLI challenge reduced lean, protein, and lipid accretion rates by 16% (P < 0.05). Genetic selection for high FE resulted in decreased ADFI and increased G:F (P < 0.01), but did not impact ADG or tissue accretion vs. low FE pigs.

A combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental triggers is widely accepted to be responsible for the onset and development of AD. Accumulating evidence shows that oxidative stress and dysregulation of energy metabolism play an important role in AD pathogenesis, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Redox-induced protein modifications have been reported in the brain of AD patients, indicating excessive oxidative damage. Coenzyme A (CoA) is essential for diverse metabolic pathways, regulation of gene expression and biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. Dysregulation of CoA biosynthesis in animal models and inborn mutations in human genes involved in the CoA biosynthetic pathway have been associated with neurodegeneration. Recent studies have uncovered the antioxidant function of CoA, involving covalent protein modification by this cofactor (CoAlation) in cellular response to oxidative or metabolic stress. Protein CoAlation has been shown to both modulate the activity of modified proteins and protect cysteine residues from irreversible overoxidation. In this study, immunohistochemistry analysis with highly specific anti-CoA monoclonal antibody was used to reveal protein CoAlation across numerous neurodegenerative diseases, which appeared particularly frequent in AD. Furthermore, protein CoAlation consistently co-localized with tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles, underpinning one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD. Double immunihistochemical staining with tau and CoA antibodies in AD brain tissue revealed co-localization of the two immunoreactive signals. Further, recombinant 2N3R and 2N4R tau isoforms were found to be CoAlated in vitro and the site of CoAlation mapped by mass spectrometry to conserved cysteine 322, located in the microtubule binding region. We also report the reversible H2O2-induced dimerization of recombinant 2N3R, which is inhibited by CoAlation. Moreover, CoAlation of transiently expressed 2N4R tau was observed in diamide-treated HEK293/Pank1? cells. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time extensive anti-CoA immunoreactivity in AD brain samples, which occurs in structures resembling neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Covalent modification of recombinant tau at cysteine 322 suggests that CoAlation may play an important role in protecting redox-sensitive tau cysteine from irreversible overoxidation and may modulate its acetyltransferase activity and functional interactions.","output":"Extensive Anti-CoA Immunostaining in Alzheimer's Disease and Covalent Modification of Tau by a Key Cellular Metabolite Coenzyme A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease in which the myelin sheaths around the axons of the brain and spinal cord are damaged, leading to demyelination and scarring as well as a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms.

CASE REPORTS: The first patient was a 53-year-old man who presented visual field disturbance in the right eye 7 days after the first vaccine dose, and who consulted a physician 10 days after the second dose, when he experienced loss of vision in the left eye. After a full examination, bilateral anterior optic disc neuropathy was diagnosed. The second patient was a 65-year-old man who presented anterior optic disc neuropathy 12 days after his first vacci-nation. In both cases, arteritic origin was ruled out due to absence of systemic symptoms and because of normal levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic optic neuropathy is a rare adverse ocular secondary effect of COVID-19 vaccines. Further basic and clinical research is needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and better characterize the clinical picture of this entity.","output":"Ischemic Optic Neuropathy After Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine: A Report of 2 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este escrito estructura una posicin jurdica sobre las excarcelaciones por motivos humanitarios o causas mdicas.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of selected ventilation measures on air change rates in school buses. Air changes per hour (ACH) of outside air were measured using a well-established carbon dioxide (CO2) tracer gas decay method. Ventilation was assessed while stationary and while traversing standardized route during late autumn/winter months in Colorado. Seven CO2 sensors located at the driver's seat and at passenger seats in the front, middle, and rear of the bus yielded similar and consistent measurements. Buses exhibited little air exchange in the absence of ventilation (ACH =0.13 when stationary; ACH =1.85 when mobile). Operating the windshield defroster to introduce fresh outside air increased ACH by approximately 0.5-1 ACH during mobile and stationary phases. During the mobile phase (average speed of 23 miles per hour (mph) ), the combination of the defroster and two open ceiling hatches (with a powered fan on the rear hatch) yielded an ACH of approximately 9.3 ACH. A mobile phase ACH of 12.4 was achieved by the combination of the defroster, ceiling hatches, and six passenger windows open 2 inches in the middle area of the bus. A maximum mobile phase ACH of 22.1 was observed by using the defroster, open ceiling hatches, driver window open 4 inches, and every other passenger window open 2 inches. For reference, ACHs recommended in patient care settings where patients are being treated for airborne infectious diseases range from 6 to 12 ACHs. The results indicate that practical ventilation protocols on school buses can achieve air change rates thought to be capable of reducing airborne viral transmission to the bus driver and student passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Investigating dilution ventilation control strategies in a modern U.S. school bus in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Superspreading events play an important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and several other pathogens. Hence, while the basic reproduction number of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be about 3 for Belgium, there is substantial inter-individual variation in the number of secondary cases each infected individual causes. Multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of superspreading events: heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility, variations in contact behavior, and the environment in which transmission takes place. While superspreading has been included in several infectious disease transmission models, our understanding of the effect that these different forms of superspreading have on the spread of pathogens and the effectiveness of control measures remains limited. To disentangle the effects of infectiousness-related heterogeneity on the one hand and contact-related heterogeneity on the other, we implemented both forms of superspreading in an individual-based model describing the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population. We considered its impact on viral spread as well as on the effectiveness of social distancing. We found that the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in infectiousness are very different from the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior. On the one hand, a higher level of infectiousness-related heterogeneity results in less outbreaks occurring following the introduction of one infected individual. Outbreaks were also slower, with a lower peak which occurred at a later point in time, and a lower herd immunity threshold. Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown decreased. On the other hand, when contact-related heterogeneity was high, this also led to smaller final sizes, but caused outbreaks to be more explosive in regard to other aspects (such as higher peaks which occurred earlier, and a higher herd immunity threshold). Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown increased. Determining the contribution of both source of heterogeneity is therefore important but left to be explored further. Author summaryTo investigate the effect of different sources of superspreading on disease dynamics, we implemented superspreading driven by heterogeneity in infectiousness and heterogeneity in contact behavior into an individual-based model for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population. We compared the impact of both forms of superspreading in a scenario without interventions as well as in a scenario in which a period of strict social distancing (i.e. a lockdown) is followed by a period of partial release. We found that both forms of superspreading have very different effects. On the one hand, increasing the level of infectiousness-related heterogeneity led to less outbreaks being observed following the introduction of one infected individual in the population. Furthermore, final outbreak sizes decreased, and outbreaks became slower, with lower and later peaks, and a lower herd immunity threshold. Finally, the risk for resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown also decreased. On the other hand, when contact-related heterogeneity was high, this also led to smaller final sizes, but caused outbreaks to be more explosive regarding other aspects (such as higher peaks that occurred earlier). The herd immunity threshold also increased, as did the risk of resurgence of outbreaks.","output":"Different forms of superspreading lead to different outcomes: heterogeneity in infectiousness and contact behavior relevant for the case of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in Norwegian pigs was largely subclinical. This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake. A sample of 1955 pigs originating from 43 breeding herds was classified into five infection status groups; seronegative pigs (n = 887); seropositive pigs (n = 874); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (n = 123); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (n = 34) and pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (n = 37). Each pig had daily recordings of feed intake and bodyweight from 33 kg to 100 kg. Marginal effects of the virus infection on the outcomes were estimated by multi-level linear regression, which accounted for known fixed effects (breed, birthdate, average daily feed intake and growth phase) and random effects (cluster effects of pig and herd). RESULTS: The seropositive and virus positive pigs had decreased (P value<0.05) growth performance compared to seronegative pigs even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirement and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg bodyweight. The effects were more marked (P value<0.03) in pigs infected at a younger age and lasted a longer period. Despite increased feed intake observed, their growth rates were lower and they took more time to reach 100 kg bodyweight compared to the seronegative pigs. CONCLUSION: Our study rejected the null hypothesis that the virus infection had negligible adverse effects on growth performance of Norwegian pigs.","output":"Adverse effects of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection on growth performance of Norwegian pigs - a longitudinal study at a boar testing station"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increases in CO2 concentrations and, consequently, temperature due to climate change are predicted to intensify. Understanding the physiological responses of Pyrrhulina aff. brevis to the climatic scenarios proposed by the IPCC (2014) for the next 100 years is of fundamental importance to determine its susceptibility. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the predicted climatic scenarios for the year 2100 on the metabolic adjustments of P. aff. brevis . Specifically, the rate of oxygen uptake, electron transport system capacity, glycogen and lactate content and the role of Na+K+-ATPases and H+-ATPase were evaluated. P. aff. brevis individuals were exposed for 15 days to the simulated climatic scenarios in climate scenario rooms, where temperature and CO2 in the air were controlled. Two rooms were used to simulate the climatic scenarios predicted by the IPCC (2014): moderate (RCP 6; 2.5 C and 400 atm CO2 above current levels) and extreme (RCP 8.5; 4.5 C and 900 atm CO2 above current levels), in addition to the \\"control room\\" that represents the current scenario. There was an increase in the metabolic rate (MO2) in the animals acclimated to the climate change scenarios (RCP 6 and RCP 8.5) compared to the current scenario.

Our data showed an increase in O2 consumption (MO2), lactate levels and H+-ATPase activity of the animals acclimated to the moderate and extreme climate change scenarios.

Therefore, this study aimed to gauge intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among ordinary people and to identify attitudes towards vaccines and barriers for vaccine acceptance. Methods: The study population comprises 1880 people residing in different countries that answer a prepared questionnaire. The questionnaire topics are demographics, historical issues, participants' attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines, concerns, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Attitudes and beliefs relating to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine, were ascertained. Overall, 66.81% of the contributors would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while %33.19 did not intend to be vaccinated. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding vaccine side effects, fear of getting sick from the uptake of the vaccine, and the absence of accurate vaccine promotion news. Individuals with higher education believe that India (68.6%) produces the best vaccine (P &lt; 0.001), while healthcare workers think the Chinese vaccine (44.2%) is the best (P = 0.020). Individuals with higher education have not been vaccinated, not be healthcare workers, and females were the most contributors to effective of the vaccine in reducing mortality from COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: Given the degree of hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccination, a multifaceted approach to facilitate vaccine uptake that includes vaccine education, behavioral change strategies, and health promotion, is paramount.","output":"Peoples' attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine, acceptance, and social trust among African and Middle East countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to investigate the key factors influencing the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and develop a model based on the theory of reasoned action, belief in conspiracy theory, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. The authors created and distributed a self-administered online questionnaire using Google Forms. Data were collected from 351 respondents ranging in age from 19 to 30 years, studying at the graduate and postgraduate levels at various public universities in Bangladesh. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that belief in conspiracy theory undermines COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, thereby negatively impacting the individual attitudes, subjective norms, and acceptance. Individual awareness, on the other hand, has a strong positive influence on the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of vaccination and the perceived ease of obtaining the vaccine positively impact attitude and the acceptance of immunization. Individuals positive attitudes toward immunization and constructive subjective norms have a positive impact on vaccine acceptance. This study contributes to the literature by combining the theory of reasoned action with conspiracy theory, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to understand vaccine acceptance behavior. Authorities should focus on campaigns that could reduce misinformation and conspiracy surrounding COVID-19 vaccination. The perceived usefulness of vaccination to prevent pandemics and continue normal education will lead to vaccination success. Furthermore, the ease with which people can obtain the vaccine and that it is free of cost will encourage students to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families, and society.","output":"A model of factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: A synthesis of the theory of reasoned action, conspiracy theory belief, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Educational Institutions have an essential role in promoting the teaching and learning process, within universities, colleges, and communities.

Lack of universal testing and death underreporting make between-country comparisons difficult. The country-level determinants of COVID-19 mortality are unknown. Objective: Derive a measure of COVID-related death rates that is comparable across countries and identify its country-level predictors. Methods: An ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting >25 COVID-related deaths until May 1, 2020 were included. The outcome was the mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential predictors assessed were most recently published Demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita; environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-April)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health systems parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population and international arrivals).

Accompanying these reports is evidence that new vectors, including Aedes spp. mosquitos, recently implicated in the global spread of Zika and chikungunya viruses, are competent for MAYV transmission, which, if true, could facilitate the spread of MAYV beyond its current range. Despite its status as an emerging virus, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent MAYV infection nor therapeutics to treat it. Here, we describe the development and testing of a novel DNA vaccine, scMAYV-E, that encodes a synthetically-designed consensus MAYV envelope sequence. In vivo electroporation-enhanced immunization of mice with this vaccine induced potent humoral responses including neutralizing antibodies as well as robust T-cell responses to multiple epitopes in the MAYV envelope.

DESIGN: A multicentre observational study comparing outcomes from a prospective cohort during the pandemic [COVID-19-ectopic pregnancy registry (CEPR)] compared with a historical pre-pandemic cohort [non-COVID-19-ectopic pregnancy registry (NCEPR)]. SETTING: Five London university hospitals. POPULATION AND METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically with ectopic pregnancy (March 2020-August 2020) were entered into the CEPR and results were compared with the NCEPR cohort (January 2019-June 2019). An adjusted analysis was performed for potentially confounding variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, management (expectant, medical and surgical), length of treatment, number of hospital visits (non-surgical management), length of stay (surgical management) and 30-day complications. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-one women met the inclusion criteria: 162 CEPR and 179 NCEPR. A significantly lower percentage of women underwent surgical management versus non-surgical management in the CEPR versus NCEPR (58.6%; 95/162 versus 72.6%; 130/179; P = 0.007). Among patients managed with expectant management, the CEPR had a significantly lower mean number of hospital visits compared with NCEPR (3.0, interquartile range [IQR] [3, 5] versus 9.0, [5, 14]; P = <0.001).

METHODS: A non-participatory covert observational study was conducted on three dates, (10.05/18.05/25.05.2020) at public spaces in 13 regions with different risks. Ten consecutive individuals were observed by each of 82 medical students (n = 2460 observations), using a structured checklist. RESULTS: Among 2353 observed persons, the female/male ratios were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 on the three dates. Almost three quarters - 73.6% (n = 552/750) were using masks on date 1, 66.5% (544/818) on date 2; and 65.7% (516/785) on date 3.

We found that (i) the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota represented a significant correlation along with the Plasmodium infection in family, genus and species level;(ii) particularly, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium canine oral taxon 255, Sutterella*, Ruminococcus 1* and Eubacterium plexicaudatum ASF492 were specific during the parasitaemia rising state, while Eubacterium nodatum group* was specific in the recovering phase at species level;(iii) the up-regulated genes from the intestinal transcriptome were mainly enriched in immune cell differentiation pathways along with the malaria development, particularly, naive CD4+ T cells differentiated into Th1, Th2 and Tfh cells in the early immune response and into Th17 cells in the later response, while B cells were activated during the whole Plasmodium infection process;(iv) the abundance of the parasitaemia phase-specific microbiota represented a high correlation with the phase-specific immune cells development, particularly, Th1 cell with family Bacteroidales BS11 gut group, genera Prevotella 9, Ruminococcaceae UCG 008, Moryella and specie Sutterella* , Th2 cell with specie Sutterella* , Th17 cell with family Peptococcaceae , genus Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group and spices Ruminococcus 1*, Ruminococcus UGG 014* and Eubacterium plexicaudatum ASF492, Tfh and B cell with genera Moryella and species Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium canine oral taxon 255.Conclusion?There were a remarkable dynamic landscape of the parasitaemia dependent shifting of intestinal microbiota and immunity, and a notable correlation between the abundance of intestinal microbiota, especially at species level, and immune cells.","output":"The Dynamic Landscape of Parasitaemia Dependent Intestinal Microbiota Shifting at Species Level and the Correlated Gut Transcriptome During Plasmodium Yoelii Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak posed serious threats not only to global health but also to the worldwide development regime. The experts, economists, policymakers, and the governments expressed their pledges and determinations to adapt and mitigate climate change. Policymakers and governments have started adopting green growth and development strategies. The progress moves further to achieve green economic efficiency (GEE) to achieve economic, social, and environmental development. One of the major challenges has been promulgating and strictly implementing environmental regulations and policies vis--vis green growth and development. China, having the second largest economy, has started its voyage to achieve GEE. However, there are multiple challenges on the way to the green economy. The objective of the present stud is to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China using fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis. To serve this purpose, the study identifies 5 alternative strategies to achieve GEE while considering 10 criteria and 48 sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to rank criteria and sub-criteria to the goal. The Fuzzy VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method has been used to rank the alternative strategies of GEE. The proposed model unveiled resource efficiency and green purchasing as the best strategy to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy followed by local production. The study provides a comprehensive insight into the green development process to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy in the post-COVID-19 world.","output":"Fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis of environmental regulation and green economic efficiency in a post-COVID-19 scenario: the case of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was the detection of infectious agents from lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples in order to describe their distribution in patients with severe acute respiratory failure and hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) in an Italian tertiary-care hospital LRT samples from 154 patients admitted to ICU from 27 February to 10 May 2020 were prospectively examined for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, bacteria and/or fungi SARS-CoV-2 was revealed in 90 patients (58 4%, 72 males, mean age 65 years) No significant difference was observed between SARS-CoV-2 positives and SARS-CoV-2 negatives with regard to sex, age and bacterial and/or fungal infections Nonetheless, fungi were more frequently detected among SARS-CoV-2 positives (44/54, 81 4%, p = 0 0053) Candida albicans was the overall most frequently isolated agent, followed by Enterococcus faecalis among SARS-CoV-2 positives and Staphylococcus aureus among SARS-CoV-2 negatives Overall mortality rate was 40 4%, accounting for 53 deaths: 37 among SARS-CoV-2 positives (mean age 69 years) and 16 among SARS-CoV-2 negatives (mean age 63 years) This study highlights the different patterns of infectious agents between the two patient categories: fungi were prevalently involved among SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and bacteria among the SARS-CoV-2-negative patients The different therapies and the length of the ICU stay could have influenced these different patterns of infectious agents","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Infectious Agents in Lower Respiratory Tract Samples Belonging to Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Units of a Tertiary-Care Hospital, Located in an Epidemic Area, during the Italian Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unmet clinical need, due to a high mortality rate, rapid mutation rate in the virus, increased chances of reinfection, lack of effectiveness of repurposed drugs and economic damage.

Further cases have since been reported in multiple countries. The reporting rates of these events indicate that they are very rare given the high numbers of vaccinated persons. Males and younger vaccinees appear more frequently affected, more often following the second vaccine dose. As vaccine programmes progress with the focus shifting to younger people, it is possible that more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis will be reported. ObjectivesTo bring together spontaneously reported data from around the world to estimate the reporting rate in different countries and better understand the risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis following exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. MethodsSpontaneous reports from the United Kingdom, United States, and European Economic Area were used to estimate the frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Cases were stratified by age, sex, and vaccine dose where data were available. Reporting rates amongst vaccinees receiving mRNA vaccines in each region were estimated. ResultsA small number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis had been submitted to each database examined. These events are very rare according to reporting rates of spontaneous adverse reactions. The events were more frequently reported amongst males, and most reports came from vaccinees aged under 30 years. The typical clinical course of these events is mild, with full recovery in most cases. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that younger vaccinees more frequently report myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with older vaccinees. These very rare events with mild clinical course followed by full recovery in most cases were more frequent following the second dose.

This paper describes a mixed methods evaluation of a large quality improvement (QI) programme that provides skills training and facilitated support to staff in 29 care homes across two localities in the West Midlands, UK. The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) is used to assess changes to care home safety climate between baseline and programme end at 24 months. We use routinely collected data to assess pre- and post-programme avoidable harms and hospital attendance/admission rates. Semi-structured interviews with programme managers (n = 18), and staff (n = 49) in four case study homes are also used to assess perspectives on programme implementation. Our results show that safety climate scores increase by 1.4 points. There are significant reductions in falls (p = 0.0006), severe pressure ulcers (p = 0.014), UTIs (p = 0.001) and any events (p = 0.0003). Emergency hospital attendances reduced, but admissions increased. Interview participants report improvements to teamwork, working practices, information sharing, knowledge and skills. Upskilling care home staff can improve working practices and attitudes towards resident safety and care quality, which may be associated with significant reductions in avoidable harms rates. Care staff turnover rates are high, which may impact the potential for longer-term sustainability of the changes observed.","output":"The Effect of Providing Staff Training and Enhanced Support to Care Homes on Care Processes, Safety Climate and Avoidable Harms: Evaluation of a Care Home Quality Improvement Programme in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the 9th March 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to ICU in the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, Wales. We prospectively recorded the rate of ICU admissions of 52 patients with COVID-19 over 60 days, focusing on the epidemiology of ethnicity and deprivation. Patients were 65% (34 of 52) male and had a median (IQR) age of 55 (48-62) years. Prevalent comorbidities included obesity (52%);diabetes (33%), and asthma (23%). COVID-19 hospital and ICU inpatient numbers peaked on days 23 and 39, respectively Ca lag of 16 days. The ICU mortality rate was 33% (17 of 52). Black, Asian and Minority Ethnics (BAME) population represented 35% of ICU COVID-19 admissions (18 of 52) and 35% of deaths (6 of 17). Within the BAME group, 72% (13 of 18) were found to reside in geographical areas representing the 20% most deprived in Wales, versus 27% of Caucasians (9 of 33). Less than 5% of the population within the hospital catchment area are of BAME descent, yet they represent a disproportionately high proportion of patients with ICU admission and mortality suffering from COVID-19. The interplay between ethnicity and deprivation, which is complex, may be a factor in our findings.

To solve these problems, we proposed an on-demand assembly-disassembly strategy, where the assembly is favorable for longer-blood-circulation and then the disassembly in tumor is favorable for boosting SDT. Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the model of organic sonosensitizers were conjugated with hyaluronic acid (HA). Then HA-HMME was mixed with catalase (CAT) and assembled into polymeric nanoparticles (CAT@HA-HMME NPs) with size of 80 nm. CAT@HA-HMME NPs exhibit good biocompatibility and a longer blood half-time (t(1/2) = 4.17 h) which is obviously longer than that (0.82 h) of HMME molecules. After HA receptor-mediated endocytosis of cancer cells, CAT@HA-HMME NPs can be cleaved by endogenous hyaluronidase, resulting in the on-demand disassembly in tumor to release HA-HMME molecules and CAT. The CAT catalyzes the endogenous H(2)O(2) into O(2) to relieve the hypoxic microenvironment, and the released HA-HMME exhibits a higher ROS generation ability, greatly boosting SDT for the inhibition of tumor growth. Therefore, the on-demand assembly-disassembly strategy may provide some insight in the design and development of nanoagents for tumor therapy.","output":"On-demand assembly of polymeric nanoparticles for longer-blood-circulation and disassembly in tumor for boosting sonodynamic therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 The outbreak and spread of the disease has caused fear, insecurity and anxiety in people around the world The pan - de mic has both direct and indirect effects on mental health problems, as fear of the virus can trigger or exacerbate mental illness and influence the onset of symptoms Case studies suggest that this emergency can affect the content of delusions and hallucinations, as well as contribute to psychotic relapse In addition to a brief review of the literature, we describe the case of three psychotic patients of the Jahn Ferenc South Pest Hospital, Centre for Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine, whose delusions and hallucinations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic In two cases, the symptoms of a reactive, transient psychotic episode presumably provoked by psychosocial stressors were determined, and in one case, the positive symptoms of a patient suffering in a psychotic disorder were determined by COVID-19","output":"[The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the content of the delusions]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be associated with local recurrences in the treatment of liver tumors. Data obtained at our center for an earlier multinational multicenter trial regarding an in-house developed simulation software were re-evaluated in order to analyze whether the software was able to predict local recurrences. METHODS Twenty-seven RFA ablations for either primary or secondary hepatic tumors were included. Colorectal liver metastases were shown in 14 patients and hepatocellular carcinoma in 13 patients. Overlap of the simulated volume and the tumor volume was automatically generated and defined as positive predictive value (PPV) and additionally visually assessed. Local recurrence during follow-up was defined as gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the visual assessment and gold standard. RESULTS Mean tumor size was 18 mm (95% CI 15-21 mm). Local recurrence occurred in 5 patients. The PPV of the simulation showed a mean of 0.89 (0.84-0.93 95% CI). After visual assessment, 9 incomplete ablations were observed, of which 4 true positives and 5 false positives for the detection of an incomplete ablation. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 80% and 77% with a correct prediction in 78% of cases. No significant correlation was found between size of the tumor and PPV (Pearson Correlation 0.10; p = 0.62) or between PPV and recurrence rates (Pearson Correlation 0.28; p = 0.16).

METHODS: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset. RESULTS: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251 to 1.431).
